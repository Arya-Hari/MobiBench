"Down Augusta way they say the azaleas are in full bloom, which is more than can be said for England’s Justin Rose. A bruising Florida swing last month saw the Englishman fall outside the world’s top 10. For a player who has been virtually a fixture in the top five for the last three years it was certainly a dent to the ego, with the Masters now just around the corner. Rose’s solution to his miserable form — three missed cuts and a 55th-place finish at the Cadillac Championship in four PGA Tour starts — was the time-honoured one. For the past two weeks, the 34-year-old has spent long hours on the practice ground. Justin Rose hit 17 out of 18 greens in regulation and signed for a 69 at the Shell Houston Open . In the first round of the Shell Houston Open on Thursday there were encouraging signs his decline will prove temporary. Rose hit 17 out of 18 greens in regulation and signed for a 69, the same score as his playing partner, the ever- consistent Jordan Spieth. ‘It’s certainly a welcome return to the sixties, for it had been a while,’ said Rose, smiling. On a day when American Scott Piercy went round in 63 and Phil Mickelson enjoyed his best round in months with a 66, it was hardly surprising the only reporter waiting to talk to Rose was this one. But under the radar is never a bad place to be going to the Masters. The boom and bust years that characterised the first half of Rose’s career meant there was never going to be any feelings of panic following his unusually poor run in the Sunshine State. ‘There’s no doubt I lost my game there but the Florida swing can be unforgiving if you’re slightly off,’ he said. ‘Over the past two weeks I feel like I’ve done some good work and whether I finish well or not here I feel like I’m going in the right direction again. ‘Basically I was getting ahead of the ball at impact, and shots were going left or right, the irons were not solid and the new putter was not working. So we’ve corrected the faults and I’ve gone back to the old putter.’ Phil Mickelson enjoyed his best round in months with a 66 on Thursday . Does he pay much attention to the world rankings? ‘You notice, for sure,’ he said. ‘I’m very proud of the fact I’ve been in the world’s top five for practically the whole of the last three years. It’s a nice ego thing, so by the end of the year I’m hoping there won’t be any slippage. ‘But right now, I’ve got to focus on my game in the knowledge that the rankings change fast when you’re playing well. I’m in all the tournaments I want to be in, so there’s no need to worry on that score. Typically, your good years are built around four or five really good weeks, so you have to stay patient.’ He’d certainly love for one of those good weeks to be the next one. Rose paid a reconnaissance visit to Augusta last Monday and felt the same old thrill. ‘It’s such a treat to enjoy it when it is quiet, you still pinch yourself,’ he said. ‘I think if I’d had a crystal ball when I was 13 or 14 and it had said I’d get to play Augusta every year, I’d have been very happy with that.’ He’s certainly had his share of adventures during his nine appearances to date. Rose might be the only player in Masters history to have led or had a share of the lead after every round bar the last one. His best chance so far of finishing on top after 72 holes came in 2007, when he stood on the 17th hole tied for the lead only to run up a fatal double-bogey six. Paul Casey celebrated his last-gasp Masters invitation with two eagle threes in a fine round of 68 . ‘The Masters has probably been less on my mind this year because I am trying to find some form,’ he admitted. ‘But I think the fact I’ve had a number of great rounds there will always stand me in good stead. Regardless of what happens here, I feel comfortable on that course and know I can manage my game even if it’s not 100 per cent. You draw off the energy of the place.’ Mickelson has certainly done that over the years and perhaps the veteran lefty, a three-time Masters champion, is gearing himself up for another run at the green jacket. ‘It was a good start to the tournament and now I’m looking for three more good rounds,’ he said. 'This is a big week for me. I felt the game was close last week. The only thing missing was chipping and short game.' Paul Casey, like Mickelson another former winner of this event, celebrated his last-gasp Masters invitation with a fine round of 68 notable for two eagle threes. In the afternoon wave, Padraig Harrington and Lee Westwood both made good starts to play their first six holes in two under.","Justin Rose bounced back from Florida misery by carding 69 in Houston .

"There was no special treatment for Lewis Ferguson at Paul Nicholls’ yard on Thursday morning. The 18-year-old was mucking out the stables as usual, just a cut on the nose to show for the fall which has made him an internet sensation. Ferguson, whose double somersault horror fall from the favourite Merrion Square in the 4.20pm at Wincanton on Wednesday has been watched hundreds of thousands of times online. But he was back riding out and said he was undeterred from getting back in the sadal. ‘It was just a blur,’ he said, ‘I couldn’t work out what had happened until I got back to the weighing room and watched the replay. All the other jockeys asked me if I was alright and stuff, they all watched with me and looked away in horror. It’s about the most impressive fall I’ve seen. Jockey Lewis Ferguson, 18, who survived a spectacular fall from Merrion Square shows off the cut on his nose . Ferguson, whose double somersault horror fall has been watched by hundreds of thousands online . The 18-year-old was mucking out the stables as usual at Paul Nicholls’ yard on Thursday morning . ‘There was nothing I could do to avoid it, you just have to let it take it’s course and hope it’s not a bad one. I’ve just got a cut on the nose so I’ve been very lucky. I got a bit of abuse from the lads and picked up a few hundred twitter followers but it’s all good banter. It won’t stop me getting back on a course. There’s been no special treatment. ‘My parents who live in the Scottish Borders were worried so I gave them a call so they knew I was ok. It’s not going to put me off riding at all I’d like to ride at the Cheltenham Festival and Aintree every year, that’s the ultimate aim. Bit disappointing because he was in front and maybe could have won. Jockey Ferguson hits the fence after his ride stumbles wildly on the approach to the fence at Wincanton . Colliding with the barrier forces the amateur jockey into a spectacular mid-air somersault . Wincanton clerk of the course Barry Johnson called it the worst fall he had ever seen. It was only Ferguson’s fifth race and the first time he had fallen although he has fallen a few times riding out. ‘Hopefully the next time I’m on the front page of the newspaper it will be for winning the Gold Cup or the Grand National. I gave the horse a little pat after, not a big one. Given the somersaults, maybe I’ll look at having a gymnastics career after finishing racing.’ Merrion Square was a hotly-tipped favourite to win the 4.20 at Wincanton on Wednesday until the fall .

"When emergency crews received a call saying 'someone' had been knocked down by a car in Essex, they immediately sent two ambulances to the rescue. But the vehicles returned to base just moments later when the caller revealed the 'victim' was actually a squirrel that had been run over in Epping Forest. The report forms just part of a long list released by East of England ambulance service detailing their most bizarre, and irritating, call outs. Two ambulances were sent to Epping Forest after a caller told crews 'someone' had been run down, only for the 'victim' to turn out to be a squirrel. Another man said he had dropped his burger and it was 'bleeding' Another came from reveller in Basildon, Essex, who said 'I've dropped my burger and it is bleeding', while a third woman in Chelmsford, dialled 999 to report 'I've eaten too much takeaway food.' The service said it receives around 2,500 calls per day, and in the last two years has had to deal with 1,248 that did not need emergency help. Front-line crews have attended almost half of the phoney calls, believing them to be genuine emergencies. Also on the list is a woman from  Shoeburyness who called to say she was locked out of the house, while a man in Peterborough called to say his feet hurt after wearing shoes that were too small. In Hitchin, Hertfordshire, a man told 999 staff: 'I have been dieting and feel lethargic.' Gary Morgan, Regional Head of Emergency Operations Centres, asked people to use common-sense when calling, adding that misguided or hoax calls could cost lives. East on England ambulance revealed the bizarre calls as part of a list of 1,248 inappropriate call outs, saying that crew attended half of them, potentially putting lives at risk (file image) He said: 'We're an emergency service and our front-line staff are trained to save lives. 'However, sadly, some of the calls we receive are not even medically related and we will refer hoax calls to the police. 'We prioritise all life-threatening calls to get the quickest possible response. 'However, that response can be affected if our call handlers and front-line staff are dealing with inappropriate 999 calls. 'We would strongly urge people who think it is funny to make a prank call to stop and think about the potential consequences.' In another strange call one woman phoned to say she felt ill after eating too much takeaway, while a man reported that his feet were hurting after wearing shoes that were too tight .","Woman reported 'someone' had been run over, but victim was a squirrel .

"A loving boyfriend has granted his girlfriend her birthday wish of having their wedding photographs taken - even though they can't officially get married yet because she is bedridden in hospital. Guo Kai and girlfriend Dong Hui, who turned 22 on Monday, had been planning to get married this month in Sichuan in southwest China. But Dong was suddenly diagnosed with serious bone cancer and admitted to hospital, meaning a formal ceremony had to be postponed, reported the People's Daily Online. Big day: Dong Hui, 22, was diagnosed with bone cancer last month but still wanted to have wedding photographs taken for her birthday . You may kiss the bride: The couple had planned to tie the knot this month, but had to make do with the photos for now . Besotted: Guo Kai (pictured right) has been at his girlfriend's bedside every day . Instead, family and friends helped Dong put on a beautiful wedding dress so that a team of professional photographers could take pictures for the besotted couple. Dong had to stay lying down the whole time due to her condition, which causes severe pain and can lead to joint dysfunction. After medical staff removed her catheter, her friends showed Dong three wedding dresses to choose from. She chose one with embroidered flowers and had her make-up done, before her husband-to-be handed her a bouquet of red roses. As they posed together, Dong whispered to her partner: 'To have you at my side is so important for me'. Since she has been admitted to hospital, Guo - who is now a firefighter - has constantly been at her bedside to attend to her every need. Commitment: Guo arranged for professional photographers to come to the hospital to take the pictures . Romantic: The couple met last year after a mutual friend introduced them and they quickly fell in love . To help with her treatment Dong needs to be turned once every hour.

"(CNN)Sunday's announcement that Corinthian Colleges Inc. would shut down all of its remaining 28 campuses is a positive development in a long struggle to hold for-profit colleges accountable. Corinthian, which once enrolled more than 70,000 students, is one of the worst of the ""predator colleges"" -- schools that offer dubious degrees, saddle students with high amounts of debt and gobble up tens of billions of dollars in federal money every year. Many of these schools are for-profit career colleges that operate mostly online. It's no wonder that Corinthian is doing this after the U.S. Department of Education curtailed its access to federal student aid last summer. There are about 1.3 million students enrolled in for-profit colleges, many of which have questionable track records, and their students need help transitioning into legitimate postsecondary schools. With Uncle Sam's student loan debt sheet topping $1 trillion, we literally can't afford to continue funding for-profit colleges -- which reportedly get 86% of their funding from federal student loan money. For those not familiar with the for-profit college fiasco, here's the whole story in one telling statistic: While for-profit colleges enroll only 13% of the nation's college students, such colleges account for nearly half of all student loan defaults, according to Department of Education statistics. For comparison's sake, the default rate of for-profit college students is worse than the default rate of the worst subprime borrowers during the financial crisis. How do these colleges operate? It's deviously simple: Convince low-income students into borrowing tens of thousands of dollars through easy federal student loans, keep costs low through online classes and part-time professors, and watch the money roll in. The aggressive tactics of these colleges boggle the mind. Recruiters are told to make 100 phone calls and leave 100 messages a day, according to a ProPublica investigation. I can personally attest to the aggressive tactics. My phone number was accidentally placed on a call list for a for-profit college recently, and I received so many calls per day that I had to ask my wireless carrier to block the phone number. Stopping the exploitation of students isn't easy. The for-profit college business is a multibillion-dollar industry. The CEOs of these companies make millions of dollars a year, employ an army of lobbyists and donate money to both political parties. But the past two months brought a new twist to the crisis. Hundreds of graduates of the now-defunct Corinthian joined a ""debt strike,"" publicly declaring their refusal to pay back their loans. In response, Education Department Secretary Arne Duncan signaled a willingness to forgive loans of Corinthian graduates who have crushing debt and no job prospects. Now that Corinthian is finally shutting down, we must finish the job. The remaining for-profit colleges should be closed. Any student not gainfully employed or transferred to a reputable college within three years should be considered a victim, and their debts should be forgiven. Yes, ""victim"" is the right word. If these degrees actually helped people get jobs, we should be celebrating them. But according to a jaw-dropping report by the Education Department, the average graduate of an online for-profit college makes less than a high school dropout. Not the equivalent of a high school dropout. Less than a high school dropout. The real-life misery caused by predatory colleges is painful to hear about. One Corinthian graduate has $37,000 in debt for his computer science degree, but he can't even get a job at Best Buy, according to Slate. Another graduate, $33,000 in debt, has a medical assisting degree, but she gave up on finding employment in her field. She waits tables now, The Chronicle of Higher Education says. I can already hear your next question. If for-profit colleges are this terrible, are they at least cheaper? No. In fact, their cost is reportedly around 60% higher than a comparable degree from a public college. What's even more frustrating is that we've known about the shenanigans of these predator colleges for years. A 2011 report by the Government Accountability Office found widespread rule breaking by the largest for-profit colleges -- everything from accepting fictitious high-school diplomas to encouraging plagiarism and cheating. In one example, an undercover federal investigator posing as a student was told by a professor, ""It's not hard to get a 100% on the second try; just jot down the correct answers and take the quiz again,"" according to The New York Times. In 2013, Career Education Corp. paid $10 million to settle charges by the state of New York regarding phony job-placement claims. All told, no fewer than 36 state attorneys general were investigating for-profit colleges in 2014. After selling off 95 of its campuses last year, Corinthian said on Sunday that it tried unsuccessfully to sell the remaining 28 campuses, blaming the failure on ""federal and state regulators seeking to impose financial penalties and conditions"" on potential buyers. You can't hide your bad behavior forever, and the questionable practices of many for-profit colleges are starting to catch up with them. Enrollment at the University of Phoenix -- the largest for-profit college in the United States -- has fallen by half, to about 213,000. We laid the smackdown on predatory lenders during the financial crisis, and it's time to do the same thing with for-profit colleges. To keep predator colleges from wrecking our faith in the college degree -- still the best pathway to a middle-class life -- we need to act now. For-profit colleges have flunked their final exam. Now it's up to their rich benefactor, Uncle Sam, to make sure they don't go back to school in the fall. Editor's Note: An earlier version of this article said the San Diego campus of the University of Phoenix had been banned from enrolling military veterans last year; that issue has been resolved.","David Wheeler: Corinthian, considered a ""predator"" school, will shut down campuses .

"Boston (CNN)The Boston Marathon is traditionally an event in which people in and around the Massachusetts capital come together, celebrate and enjoy. But not in 2013, when three people died and over 200 were injured when a pair of bombs went off within 12 seconds of each other at the finish line. And not this year -- at least not if you're a member of the jury that convicted Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in the bombings. That's what federal Judge George A. O'Toole told jurors Tuesday, stressing the importance of avoiding anything that could be prejudicial in the trial's sentencing phase. That begins April 21, a day after this year's edition of the landmark race. ""Do not attend the Boston Marathon or any events or gatherings related to the anniversary or the current running of the Boston Marathon,"" O'Toole said in court. The judge spoke for less than 10 minutes, and stressed the seriousness of his warnings. The first phase of Tsarnaev's trial began March 4, after which federal prosecutors called 92 witnesses, and the defense just four. Timeline of the bombings, manhunt and aftermath . Tsarnaev's lawyers never disputed that their client was at the scene of the bombings and part of the days-long mayhem that followed. Tsarnaev lawyer Judy Clarke acknowledged in opening arguments that: ""It was him."" But Clarke argued that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev only took part in the plot under the influence of his brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who died after the bombings, but before his brother was captured in a boat parked in a Watertown backyard, . That argument wasn't enough to sway the jury, though. Rather, they convicted Dzhokhar Tsarnaev on all 30 counts he faced -- including using weapons of mass destruction, bombing a place of public use, conspiracy and aiding and abetting. A look at all of the charges . The only question now, short of a successful appeal of that verdict, is what price he'll now pay. The maximum penalty for several of the charges is death. Talking to the jury on Tuesday, O'Toole predicted that the sentencing phase will last four weeks before cautioning that forecasting a specific timetable is less reliable than guessing the weather. The plan is for the court to be in session for four days a week, as long as the process takes. Until then, O'Toole told the jurors, ""Please put the case out of your minds. Enjoy the warm weather."" What's next for Tsarnaev? CNN's Ann O'Neill reported from Boston. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet, Alexandra Field, Aaron Cooper, Kevin Conlon, Jason Hanna and Steve Almasy contributed to this report.","Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found guilty of all 30 counts, may face death penalty .

"Vowing to cling on: Liberal Democrats leader Nick Clegg makes a speech during a General Election campaign visit to Sutton in south London yesterday . Nick Clegg yesterday vowed to cling on as Liberal Democrat leader even if the party is wiped out at the polls. Friends of the Deputy Prime Minister have previously indicated that he will quit as leader if the Lib Dems are reduced to fewer than 30 MPs, while sources have also suggested he will go if the party is left out of power after the election. But yesterday he insisted he would fight for his job ‘in all circumstances’. He told Sky News: ‘I’m really optimistic about the prospects of Liberal Democrats. 'Of course I want to continue to serve the country and serve my party, which I am so proud to have served for seven or eight years now.’ He added: ‘I want to lead the Liberal Democrats into and through the next Parliament in all circumstances. ‘All I am focused on at the moment is sounding the alarm about the very, very real risk that as the Labour Party and Conservative Party vacate the centre ground and hare off in which direction after another, there is a very real risk we undo all the sacrifices and hard work that have gone in over the last five years to put the country back on track economically.’ Meet and greet: Mr Clegg (far right) speaks to voters and their families during a General Election campaign visit to Sutton with Paul Burstow (second right) the party's candidate for Sutton and Cheam . His comments came as Business Secretary Vince Cable said he hoped to be made Chancellor if the Lib Dems form another coalition with the Conservatives. Mr Clegg also appeared to lean towards another deal with the Tories, saying he deserved ‘credit’ for forming the Coalition while he had endured ‘five years of constant bile from the Labour Party, who condemned us vitriolically for taking decisions which we only had to take because we had to clear up the mess they left behind’.","Sources claimed he'd go if Lib Dems are reduced to fewer than 30 MPs .

"Paul Gregory, 51, of Bedford, has been fined £795 for having a blue badge, claiming he could only walk 200 metres, when in fact he was a keen walker . A disability badge holder who claimed he could only walk 200 metres ended up in court after council officials noticed a newspaper report recounting his exploits on a 191-mile hike. When Paul Gregory, 51, applied to renew his blue badge, he claimed exercise left him breathless, despite being a keen walker and member of a mountaineering club. He was exposed when Bedford Borough Council staff read an article in The Westmorland Gazette,  describing how the 'experienced walker' had been attacked by cows in Cumbria on the third day of a hike in 2012. The article, which featured a picture of him dressed in walking gear, told how he was knocked over by four cows in a field at the edge of Shap in Cumbria. The council also found he had spent a weekend walking in Wales days before making a blue badge application. Gregory, of Bedford, pleaded guilty to two counts of dishonestly obtaining a blue badge by misrepresenting his physical abilities at Luton Magistrates' Court. He was fined £795, ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work and pay a £60 victim surcharge. He was also subject to a one year supervision order and told to undergo 19 sessions of 'thinking skills'. A Bedford Borough Council spokesman said it was one of the 'most outrageous cases' of blue badge fraud it had investigated. He said: 'He was taking part in national walking trips that many able-bodied adults would find difficult. 'Mr Gregory's abuse of the scheme is completely unacceptable and we will continue to investigate all reports of blue badge fraud thoroughly.'

"Apple offers a range of ways to unlock its devices from PINs to passwords and fingerprints. But you could soon use a selfie to gain access to your apps and messages thanks to Apple's latest patent. The filing details a system of scanning a user's face with the front-facing camera when the handset is moved into a certain position, and automatically unlocking the device if the image matches one on file. The patent (illustrated) was filed by the California-based firm in March 2011 and awarded earlier this week. It details a method of scanning a user's face using the front-facing camera each time the phone is moved into a certain position. If the scanned face matches a previously taken photo, the phone unlocks automatically . The patent was filed by the Californian tech giant in March 2011 and awarded earlier this week. Called 'Locking and unlocking a mobile device using facial recognition', the patent explains that current methods of unlocking a device are 'inconvenient and time consuming'. Apple's patent details a method for automatically unlocking a mobile device using a system comprising of 'capturing an initial image  while the device is locked, monitoring a motion state of the mobile device to determine whether the device is moving or is motionless;  analysing the images to detect a user's face and unlocking the device.' Android Lollipop users already have an almost identical feature known as Trusted face in the Smart Lock menu. It is an extension of Face Unlock that launched on Android Ice Cream Sandwich. Once the screen is enabled and the camera is held in front of the face, the screen automatically unlocks. This relies on the user pressing the power button to enable the screen. By comparison it appears that Apple's proposed system would track the movement of the phone to determine whether it is being used, or is placed flat on a table.

By comparison, it appears that Apple's proposed system would track the movement of the phone to determine whether it is being used, or is placed flat on a table. The screen wouldn't need to be enabled. Instead, once the phone is moved and positioned in front of the face the camera would begin scanning. It will only unlock if the angle of the face matches, or is similar to, the one that was initially taken to avoid the phone unlocking simply when the phone is near a face. As Apple explained: 'In one embodiment, the image is analysed for a facial profile of a human face, without regard to a specific user. Apple's proposed system tracks the movement of the phone to determine whether it is being used, or is placed flat on a table (flow chart shown). The screen wouldn't need to be enabled. Instead, once the phone is moved and positioned in front of the face the camera would begin scanning for a face . Android Lollipop users already have an almost identical feature known as 'Trusted face' (left) in the Smart Lock menu. Once the screen is enabled and the camera is held in front of the face, the screen automatically unlocks. The face icon between the Whatsapp and Chrome logo (right) shows the feature is enabled . 'In this case, the device will only need to determine that a human facial profile is present.' It continued that once an allotted period of time has elapsed and a user's face is not detected in any of the images, the device stays locked. 'In another embodiment, detecting the user's face may also include verifying that the user is an authorised user of the device,' the files continued. 'Trusted face' and Smart Lock are extensions of the Face Unlock feature that was launched on Android Ice Cream Sandwich (pictured). This relies on the user pressing the power button to enable the screen . 'The predetermined facial profile may be determined from an image that was previously captured by the device's camera and stored in a storage of images of authorised users.' Chip maker Qualcomm has unveiled its Sense ID 3D fingerprint scanner - the first biometric sensor using ultrasonic technology. It uses ultrasonic sound waves to capture the ridges, sweat pores and more on the tip of a finger in greater detail than capacitive touch ID sensors seen on the likes of Apple and Samsung devices. This not only makes it more accurate than other sensors, but it will also work even if the user’s hands are wet or have dirt or lotions on it, for example. Phones running Sense ID are expected to launch later this year, but Qualcomm did not reveal to MailOnline which devices or manufacturers it is working with. The patent also suggests this feature could be used by multiple users, in the way that multiple fingerprints can be added to its current Touch ID system. 'In this case, the database of images of authorised users would contain an image for each  user,' it added. 'To match a facial profile in the subsequent image, the device would have to compare the subsequent image to each image in the database. 'Furthermore, each authorised user may have an associated unlocking profile in the database that indicates what functions or applications of the device are enabled when the device is unlocked.' Phone makers are looking for alternative ways to secure devices while making them faster and more convenient to open. For example, Fujitsu recently demonstrated its iris scanning prototype that lets people access phones, apps and online accounts by staring at an infrared sensor. This would work in a similar way to facial recognition, but is more secure and unique to an individual user.

A total of 238 lots are being sold by Dominic Winter auctioneers at its saleroom in South Cerney, Gloucestershire. Mr Hardy, who lives in the Cotswolds, said that he was sad to sell his collection. 'Downsizing and losing a great part of a treasured library makes for sadness,' he said. 'Entrusting it all to Dominic Winter and Co has taken away much of the pain, and through them I wish anyone who comes to possess anything that was mine as much joy and pleasure as it has given me through the years.' Historical: An early 20th-century painting of Alfred the Great rebuilding London, by Frank Owen Salisbury . Auction: The objects are being sold at Dominic Winter in Gloucestershire on Saturday . Pride: Mr Hardy pictured in 2012 with the longbow and other objects from his collection . He has built up the haul of antiques thanks to his interest in classic literature and military history.

He was also consulted as an expert during the raising of the Tudor shipwreck the Mary Rose. Mr Hardy, a close friend of Richard Burton, worked with top actors including Laurence Olivier, John Gielgud and Judi Dench during his early days as a Shakespearean specialist. He found national fame playing vet Siegfried Farnon in All Creatures Great and Small, the hit BBC drama which aired between 1978 and 1990 and also starred Lynda Bellingham.

Mr Hardy was forced to retire from stage acting two years ago, when he suffered a fall while playing Churchill again in The Audience, a West End play about the Queen which starred Helen Mirren.

The injured driver, with blood seeping from a head wound, seeks help  after the attack . A statement on the club's official website on Sunday said: 'We consider that as long as this attack is not solved in a way that satisfies Fenerbahce and public opinion, a suspension of the championship is inevitable. 'Blood ran and football was silenced. Finding and punishing the culprits is of vital importance for Fenerbahce.' Following the incident, Fener midfielder Mehmet Topal told Sky News: 'We cheated death. God protect us. I hope our driver will be all right. Words fail me. It's unbelievable.' The club posted several pictures of the bus on their website after the attack which showed a shattered side window and damage to the front windscreen.

"A narrow two-bedroom home so small it is only 5ft wide in places has been snapped up for a staggering £750,000. The tiny home is sandwiched between two double fronted properties on a leafy street in Islington, north London. Despite being only a little wider than a rugby player’s shoulders, the estate agency blurb described the property as being 'well proportioned'. Scroll down for video . The tiny home (circled), sandwiched between two other properties, which has sold for £750,000, is located on a leafy street in Islington, north London . Inside, the narrow house is only 5ft wide in some areas, a little over the size of a rugby player's shoulders and its maximum width is 8ft 8in . The home has what boat owners would call a narrow 'galley kitchen', an expert has said, with the estate agency calling it 'well proportioned' The property is a two-bedroom apartment, with a narrow but long and extended back section . It also features tiny study, reception room, shower room, cloakroom, kitchen and a garden and is said to be garnering a lot of interest . It has two-bedrooms, a tiny study, reception room, shower room, cloakroom, kitchen and a garden. At its widest, it stretches across 8ft 8in. The property was put on the market with Foxtons for £750,000 - almost double the price it sold for in 2001. Neither its dimensions nor its size put off buyers - with the estate agency yesterday confirming the home was now under offer. The advert called it a 'stylish two bedroom period house' which 'offers beautifully bright living space throughout with characterful touches and a pretty rear garden'. Foxtons declined to comment. At a price of £750,000, the buyer will have to pay £27,000 in stamp duty - the same as a second-hand narrow boat which is 50ft long. Henry Pryor, a buying agent, said: 'This home must be one of the few in which you genuinely could not swing a cat. 'Strangely the first floor master bedroom is wider than the ground floor room below and it has what boat owners would know as a ""galley kitchen"". 'A lot of buyers would struggle with the idea of living in a home little bigger than a cricket net.'

"The mother of a mentally ill daughter who killed herself last month has revealed how her condition worsened over years and eventually drove her to suicide. Doris Fuller's daughter, Natalie, 28, suffered from bipolar disorder and psychosis, and died when she stepped in front of a train in Baltimore, Maryland, last month. And in the wake of her death, Fuller has written about how her illness, which went undiagnosed until her early 20s, and said she was 'the bravest person I have ever known'. Scroll down for video . Opening up: Doris Fuller's daughter Natalie, left with her mom, killed herself last month - and now Fuller has opened up about how Natalie's bipolar disorder and psychosis led to her death . The mother and daughter pair had shot to fame in 2004 when they collaborated on a parenting guide based on Natalie being totally honest with her mother about whatever she was asked. Bestseller: Natalie opened up to her mom - and the result was this popular parenting book . In a long article about her daughter's life for the Washington Post, Fuller wrote how their famously close relationship was changed for good when Natalie had her first psychotic episode at the age of 22, after she had left for college. Fuller wrote: 'In the span of a few weeks she went from being a dazzling young adult with the world at her feet to a psych-ward patient with an arrest record.' Summarizing her last years, she said: 'My daughter lived more than six years with an incurable disease that filled her head with devils that literally hounded her to death, and she did it while laughing, painting, writing poetry, advocating and bringing joy to the people around her. 'She was the bravest person I have ever known, and her suicide doesn’t change that.' And though medicines and proper treatment gave Natalie her life back for a time, she eventually decided to stop taking her meds, which brought her troubles back, even more acute than before. In a mental health documentary video filmed in 2014, Natalie described the worst lows of her condition, in which she said terrifyingly real voices would tell her to hurt herself. She told the cameras: 'I believed that everything happening to me was real, and I thought that I was acting fine. 'But my mom and my brother and everyone around me could see something that I couldn't see. 'Even though [the voices] were telling me to hurt myself and do horrible things to myself, I still listened to them because I had a relationship with them. I thought they were real.' Although Natalie, a keen artist who sculpted, painted and wrote poetry, often seemed fine while on medication, Fuller told how her future seemed a little bleaker every time she relapsed. Difficulties: Natalie (left in 2014) was not diagnosed with a mental health problem until she was 22 - before then she had a regular childhood (right). She told how as she grew older voices started telling her to harm herself . Growing up: As a teenager, Natalie's no-holds-barred honesty helped make her mom a bestseller . She wrote: 'If she even inadvertently missed a few days of medication - even while receiving therapy and other forms of treatment - the demons would return, and one of the first things they would tell her was to stop taking her medicine. 'The second thing they would tell her was not to talk to her mom, the most powerful other influence in her life. 'Each time she obeyed and relapsed, she plunged into a longer free fall, hitting the ground harder, recovering more slowly and returning at a lower plateau.' According to the article, the final, ultimately fatal, change came last fall when Natalie concluded that the drugs were not helping her at all, and gave them up for good. Fuller was not specific about what happened in Natalie's last weeks, though in a post on a tribute site to her daughter, she mentioned that she had holidayed in Nicaragua with members of her family in February. Fuller, the executive director of the Treatment Advocacy Center charity has said since Natalie's death that she wants her 'legacy' to be increased understanding and compassion for the those who have mental illnesses.

"So, once again, it will all come down to the actions of a man from Salto. On this occasion, though, the focus will not be on Salto’s most famous son. Luis Suarez will be at the Parc des Princes tonight, forming one part of football’s most famous three-man attack, looking to fire Barcelona into the Champions League semi-finals. Usually when they reach this stage, Barcelona do not make any mistakes. Standing on the other side of the pitch will be someone who Suarez knows inside out, a player who hails from his home city in Uruguay and with whom he has shared a number of big nights when representing their country. Edinson Cavani prepares for Paris Saint-Germain's quarter-final clash with Barcelona . PSG train at Camp-des-Loges in Saint-Germain-en-Laye, west of Paris . Cavani celebrates scoring for the Paris side in the League Cup final last weekend . Edinson Cavani knows the spotlight will be shining on him this evening. If Paris Saint-Germain are to break through the glass ceiling and progress beyond the Champions League’s last eight, Cavani – a player known as El Matador – must torment the stars from Catalonia. The onus falls on Cavani for a number of reasons. First, PSG have been stripped by suspension of two key players, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Marco Veratti, the product of that ugly last 16 success against Chelsea; Thiago Motta is injured, while David Luiz is also a major doubt. Yet there is more to it than that. Cavani has a towering reputation in the game, stemming from three prolific seasons in Naples which led to his record-breaking move to Paris, but can you think of a really vital game that he has stamped his class all over? To suggest that may seem a little harsh. He came within the width of a goal post at Stamford Bridge of being the undisputed match winner and his bullet header in the first leg in February that gave Laurent Blanc’s side the opportunity to travel to London with parity. Since then, however, Cavani has endured problems and a significant goal drought for one of his talent. Between February 17 and April 5, Cavani went seven matches without scoring and only ended the fallow spell with a double as a substitute in the Coupe de Ligue final on Saturday. PSG won that game 4-0 but had matters sewn up before Cavani came on and helped himself to a double late on (Ibrahimovic had scored twice to give them breathing space); it was his first action since an angry altercation with Blanc a week earlier during a 3-2 win in Marseille. Zlatan Ibrahimovic slides in on Oscar during PSG's second round clash at Chelsea last month . Ibrahimovic is shown the red card for his challenge on Oscar to leave PSG up against it . Ibrahimovic trudges off the field and will miss the first leg of the quarter-final against Barcelona . It has led to speculation about his future in Paris and he has been linked with a number of sides in the Barclays Premier League; Liverpool, for one, would have loved to have signed him last summer but the figures were exorbitant (he earns more per week than Radamel Falcao). Arsenal and Manchester United have also been mentioned with him, while Manchester City tested the water in June 2013 when it was clear that Cavani’s time in Serie A was over; the intensity of his play, you suspect, would enhance his prospects of thriving in the English game. Nasser Al Khelaifi, PSG’s president, maintains one of the jewels in their crown will not be sold this summer but the recent noises Cavani has made have not been ultra-enthusiastic and hint that he might be ready for a new challenge after two years in France. ‘I came to play as a centre-forward with Zlatan and after, things changed for a variety of reasons,’ said Cavani. ‘Everything else is perfect in Paris. The club has behaved very well towards me. I have had some difficult moments personally, and they protected me, supported me. ‘The fans have also always supported me. I think I'm in one of the best places in the world. I'm staying focused on my preparation to give my best for my team, to the club that pays me and has shown faith in me. You never know in football. I'm not thinking about it.’ Tonight his focus will be on Barcelona. With six goals in eight Champions League appearances this season – he averages one every 143 minutes and has created 10 chances for his team-mates – it would be risible to suggest Cavani has something to prove on this stage. That said, it might not be wrong to suggest he needs a big moment. Ibrahimovic’s ability to sprinkle stardust is beyond question, while Veratti is fast becoming one of the finest midfielders in Europe but, without them, PSG need their man from Salto to sparkle. Their prospects depend on him. Louis van Gaal is considering a move for Cavani after seeing Radamel Falcao struggle this season .

"Time fries when you're having fun. Dedicated waitress Judy Eddingfield, 65, celebrated her 50th anniversary working at Winstead's restaurant in Kansas City last week and declares that it's the only job's she's ever had or ever wanted. 'It's like my home away from home and I just love it here,' Eddingfield told Fox. Scroll down for video . Dedicated employee: For most of her life Judy Eddingfield has been employed as a server at Winstead's in Kansas City and says it's the only job she's ever had or ever wanted . Is that you? A staff member at Winstead's said she believes one of the women in this photograph is Judy when she first started working at the restaurant . Classic establishment:  This is a photo of the The Winstead family who own the restaurant showing up for work in 1940 around the time when Judy Eddingfield's mother started working there . Eddingfield says she remembers when French fries and a classic Coca-Cola cost just 65 cents at the same restaurant she's worked at for half-a-century. For Eddingfield, slinging burgers with a smile is a family tradition. On April, 6, 1965 Eddinngfield began working at the restaurant where she was trained by her mother who had already been employed at the establishment for 13 years. Eddingfield said that her first day on the job when she was just 15-years-old she spilled a shake all over a woman's fur coat and thought for sure that she'd be fired. 'The tray tipped over and vanilla malt slid down a lady’s fur coat. I was so embarrassed,' Eddingfield told the Kansas City Star 'Of course, she hollered,' said Eddingfield. All was forgiven after Winstead's, open since 1940, got the coat cleaned. Eddingfield along with many of her siblings continued to provide top notch service. Loves to serve: Judy Eddingfield says that her kind customers are what make her job worthwhile . Lots of love: Winstead's honored Judy Eddingfield last week for her wonderful 50 years of working at the classic burger restaurant . 'I had two brothers, my sister, my mother, two aunts, two cousins and lots of friends that have worked here,' said Eddingfield. 'I was three years old when my mother started here, so I've been eating these burger 60 some years.' Eddingfield says she even met her first husband outside the restaurant and they married 18 months later. The Kansas City Star reports that one of Eddingfield's favorite Winstead’s memories was when Jerry Mathers and Tony Dow of the television series 'Leave It to Beaver' came to eat there in the late 1970's. She said that Mathers was 'talking with his hands' and knocked sent his food flying everywhere. Marriage: Judy Eddingfield even met her true love who she calls 'Frog' at Winstead's and the pair married 18-months-later . Celebration: Dedicated waitress Judy Eddingfield celebrated her 50th anniversary working at Winstead's restaurant in Kansas City last week and declares that it's the only job's she's ever had or ever wanted . 'Leave it to Beaver,' his on-screen brother said jokingly, almost as though it were scripted. On a scarier note, Eddingfield says she once was closing up the restaurant when a man started knocking on the door with a gun. She called 911 and hid in the bathroom until the police arrived. Eddingfield's employees say that as she gets older Eddingfield gets more delightful and that she is always willing to share her knowledge of the business. 'She trained me to be her. Pleasant as she is, prompt. So that people will come here for you and continue to come,' said server Sue Allen who has been there for 13 years. Close knit team: Eddingfield, pictured with some of her coworkers, has a passion for serving food . Nothing's changed!: Winstead's when it first opened in 1940 has an almost identical style to the Winstead's that's here today . Eddingfield's biggest tip she ever received was a generous man who treated his entire staff in 2014 and staff agree it was well deserved. Eddigfield turns 66 on May 13 and though she is getting older, she plans to keep on working as long as she is healthy. When asked why she chose to stay at the establishment for so long, she replied that the customers make her job worthwhile. 'The customers really make it special,' she says. General manager Kathi Fern says that Eddingfield is one of her best employees. 'It's just amazing the way she treats her customers,' said Fern. 'I call her my dinosaur. She's a dying breed and there will never be servers like her again.' said Fern of her dedicated employee. Classic drive-thru: Winstead's was established in 1940 and to this day is known for serving quality burgers at their drive-thru .","'It's like my home away from home and I just love it here,' Judy Eddingfield said of Winstead's in Kansas City .

"Microsoft has a new pilot program to hire people with autism for full-time positions within the company. The announcement was made on the company's blog by Microsoft Corporate VP of Worldwide Operations, Mary Ellen Smith, who has a teenage son, Shawn, with autism. The positions will be based at its Redmond campus in Washington and the program will be run in partnership with Specialisterne, a Danish nonprofit that helps train people with autism for careers in IT. Smith wrote on the blog: 'It's simple, Microsoft is stronger when we expand opportunity and we have a diverse workforce that represents our customers.' The announcement was made on the company's blog by Microsoft Corporate VP of Worldwide Operations, Mary Ellen Smith, who has a teenage son, Shawn, with autism . 'The day my son was diagnosed I distinctly remember the final words of two doctors I overheard as my husband and I left the medical center, ""I think they understand."" 'I also remember how we walked to the car, pulled onto the road, drove 15 miles to our home, and entered the house. All in silence. We did not know what to say. 'But we do now. What we learned over the last 15 years was to find our voice. To model what a unique advantage a young man like my son Shawn can offer.

She added: 'I am also proud of how our society and our workplace is moving forward with the commitment to help support people with autism and disabilities in general.' Last year Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was forced to apologize for saying that women don't need to ask for a raise and should just trust the system to pay them well. Nadella was blasted on Twitter and in blog posts for his comments, which were made at an event for women in computing. He had been asked to give his advice to women who are uncomfortable requesting a raise. His response: 'It's not really about asking for the raise, but knowing and having faith that the system will actually give you the right raises as you go along.' Microsoft is now focusing on diversity. Last year Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella (pictured) was forced to apologize for saying that women don't need to ask for a raise and should just trust the system to pay them well . Not asking for raise, he added, is 'good karma' that would help a boss realize that the employee could be trusted and should have more responsibility. Still, his comments at the event, the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing, underscored why many see technology companies as workplaces that are difficult to navigate or even unfriendly for women and minorities. Tech companies, particularly the engineering ranks, are overwhelmingly male, white and Asian. Criticized for their lack of diversity, major companies say they are trying to address the problem with programs such as employee training sessions and by participating in initiatives meant to introduce girls to coding. Twenty-nine percent of Microsoft's employees are women, according to figures the company released last year. Its technical and engineering staff and its management are just 17 percent female. That's roughly comparable to diversity data released by other big tech companies last year. Commenting on Microsoft's decision Sarah Lambert, Head of Policy at the National Autistic Society, told Daily Mail Online: 'It's encouraging to see a global company like Microsoft recognise the untapped potential of adults with autism and we hope that other organisations follow their lead. 'Autism is a spectrum condition and many people may have strengths such as accuracy, a good eye for detail and reliability, which can benefit all sorts of businesses, not just the technology industry.'","Microsoft Corporate VP of Worldwide Operations, Mary Ellen Smith, who has a teenage son Shawn with autism, made the announcement .

"Zara Phillips has revealed how she got her fitness back after the birth of her first child Mia - by hitting the exercise bike every morning before her daughter even woke up. The 33-year-old, who is vying for a place on Team GB at the Rio Olympics, welcomed Mia Grace with husband Mike Tindall last year. But after finding herself 'surprised' by how her fitness dropped during pregnancy, the Queen's granddaughter has committed to a strict exercise and diet regime to get back in shape. Scroll down for video . Zara Phillips has told of how she was surprised at how difficult it was to regain her fitness after the birth of her daughter, Mia, one (pictured left in January and right, last July when Mia was six months old) 'What surprised me about having a baby is losing all your fitness and how tough it is to get it back to that level again,' she said in an interview with The Sunday Time Magazine. Starting her morning at 7am, Zara has a breakfast of Greek yogurt and honey and tries to get in a stint on the exercise bike at her home, Gatcombe Park, before Mia wakes at 8am. Her day is then typically spent with the horses kept at her mother, Princess Anne's stables, before squeezing in another workout. 'Lunch is quick and simple, like soup and a sandwich or eggs and toast. I don't diet but I try to eat well and not to eat too many carbohydrates or sugary things.

A keen eventer, she said she is eager for daughter Mia to spend time around horses as she grows up. 'I expect Mia will grow up with horses all around her, just like her mum did,' she added. The one-year-old's father previously revealed the couple had 'three Shetland ponies waiting for her'. Speaking in an interview in January, Mr Tindall, who has recently taken part in the reality skiing show The Jump, said: 'Eventing children have to be very relaxed. 'You are going to travel around a lot.' Earlier this year Zara told of how little Mia enjoyed playing with her royal relatives Prince George and her cousins, Savannah and Isla. Speaking to Daily Mail Australia at Magic Millions Race Day in January she said of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge: 'We've all got small ones now so it's great fun.'

"In recent years, Iceland has become an increasingly popular filming location with its majestic vistas being prominently featured in many hit TV series or Hollywood blockbusters. Despite the fact that Iceland has been used in filming as far back as 1920, well-known fantasy, sci-fi and action film directors and producers have all descended on the island nation as of late, prompting the quick development of 17 production services companies nationwide. Although the country's many stunning waterfalls and breathtaking glaciers translate beautifully to the silver screen, there are certain filming locations that consistently rank a cut above and are drawing fans of productions such as Game of Thrones, Interstellar or Prometheus. Thingvellir National Park provided the location for the North of Westeros in Game of Thrones . Fans will likely recognise the National Park as the setting of the battle of the Hound and Brienne . The black volcanic landscapes of Svartalfheim provided the filmmakers of Thor: The Dark World with the perfect otherworldly setting, as outlined in this Icelandair infographic. Meanwhile, Clint Eastwood opted to film battle scenes for both Letters from Iwo Jima and Flags of Our Fathers in Iceland – specifically along the dramatic cliffs of the Reykjanes Peninsula, just a quick drive from the capital. Scenes from Christopher Nolan’s epic Interstellar were filmed atop the blue ice glacier Svinafellsjokull in the Skaftafell National Park, which is also located near another favoured filming location: Iceland’s largest glacier, Vatnajokull. The Svinafellsjokull glacier provided a stunning setting for Christopher Nolan's epic film, Interstellar . Interstellar tells the tale of explorers who travel in search of a new planet to sustain the human race . Europe's most powerful waterfall, the Dettifoss, was used in the opening scenes of Prometheus . In Prometheus, the rushing waterfall in the background is meant to help depict the beginning of time . 'Interstellar was my second time filming in Iceland and it was another worldly experience,' the director told Film In Iceland. 'Iceland truly represents the beautiful extremes the nature has to offer.' Not to be left out, Ridley Scott scouted Europe’s most powerful waterfall, the Dettifoss, for the opening scenes depicting the beginning of time in Prometheus. And finally, Game of Thrones enthusiasts will undoubtedly recognise the north of Iceland, namely Thingvellir National Park, from Arya’s storyline and as the setting of the battle of the Hound and Brienne, in the North of Westeros. The Jokullsarlon lake, at the foot of the massive massive Vatnajokull glacier, is another favoured filming spot .","Iceland has become an increasingly popular filming location recently .

"The family of conjoined twin sisters who died 19 days after they were born have been left mortified after they arrived at their gravesite to find cemetery staff had cleared the baby section of all mementos and tossed them in the rubbish. Faith and Hope Howie were dubbed the miracle twins when they were born on May 8 last year with one body and two faces due to an extremely rare condition known as disrosopus. They died in hospital less than a month after they were born and their parents, Simon Howie and Renee Young, laid them to rest at Pinegrove Memorial Park in Sydney's west. Scroll down for video . Faith and Hope Howie were dubbed the miracle twins when they were born on May 8 last year with one body and two faces due to an extremely rare condition known as disrosopus . Family members have visited the grave every week to leave mementos and flowers for Faith and Hope, but when Mr Howie and Ms Young arrived on Thursday they found the site completely bare. 'We took Renee's aunts to see the girls for the first time and we found everything had been stripped away,' Mr Howie told Daily Mail Australia. 'We were devastated and mortified. We've had a little shrine set up and we've been adding to it since the funeral. 'It's heartbreaking to know we've set this up and it has been treated like rubbish.' Faith and Hope were buried in a pink coffin and their family and friends released doves and pink and white balloons at their funeral. Their family and friends had built up a small memorial with pink and white statues, flowers, pebbles and toys over the past 11 months. When they arrived on Thursday, everything had been removed apart from a bunch of flowers. The twins were buried at Pinegrove Memorial Park in western Sydney after they died after just 19 days. Their family and friends had built a small shrine at their gravesite, which they have added to since the funeral . Family members have visited the grave every week to leave mementos and flowers for Faith and Hope, but when parents Simon Howie and Renee Young arrived on Thursday they found the site completely bare . Faith and Hope's parents confronted staff from the cemetery and were told they were supposed to have been notified they are would be cleaned. They found their daughters' belongings in nearby rubbish bins, but were only able to retrieve about 25 percent of their memorabilia. 'There was no warning, it was just manhandled and thrown in the rubbish. It was through the entire baby section.' The couple retrieved what they could find and returned later in the afternoon to see what else they could salvage - by then everything had been laid out on shelves for people to collect. 'We've gone down there and maintained it. We make sure either side of the girls is clipped with scissors to (workers) don't need to go near it,' Mr Howie said. He said there was no reason for the items to be taken away.

'We pay the money to have the plot, they should be able to just take little mementos. It's just not fair on the families,' Mr Howie said. 'We got to those places to grieve - we're only one month out from the girls turning one... and it's been stripped naked. We have to start again. 'It obviously meant nothing to (the workers). I understand they have a job to do, but this is somebody else's loved one.' Pinegrove has offered an apology to the families affected. Faith and Hope were born with a rare condition called diprosopus, which means they share the same body and organs but have separate brains and two faces . The girls were transferred to Westmead Children's Hospital shortly after their birth on May 8 where they were closely monitored by doctors and nurses . They passed away just 19 days after they were born - their condition was so rare that only 35 cases have ever been recorded and none survived . 'The collection and storage of ornaments, especially photos, should have been handled much more respectfully and our goal is to improve it for the future,' Pinegrove's communication manager Karl Wolfenden said. 'We do understand the emotions of affected families. We have apologised to those we have spoken to and we have invited them to meet so we can find a solution that is agreeable to all. We are inviting other affected families to make contact also. 'Pinegrove is a fresh flower only and no ornamentation park but despite our rules and regulations we should have shown more respect to these items. 'We will discuss and seek an agreeable solution with families in the weeks ahead.' Faith and Hope's parents have set up an online petition to have the rules and regulations at cemetery's changed to ensure memorial items are not removed without being notified.

"A bitter war of words has erupted between a young woman and a butcher in Sydney's eastern suburbs over exactly what happened when Belinda Bartholomew, the girlfriend of Roosters star Aidan Guerra, tried to buy a chicken to cook up for a Game Of Thrones-inspired feast. According to Ms Bartholomew, she was called names and told to go to 'an Aussie butcher' when she tried to change her chicken selection. However the butcher who was working at the shop on Monday has hit back saying Ms Bartholomew is 'lying' and trying to ruin the business. Scroll down for video . Belinda Bartholomew claims she was racially abused at a Bondi butcher on Monday night when she was buying a chicken for her and her Roosters star boyfriend Aidan Guerra to have for dinner . The war of words started, Ms Bartholomew claims, when the man working at Sam the Butcher in Bondi called her a 'f***ing c***' when she asked for a different chicken to the one he had picked up. There were apparently more problems when she went to use her card to pay for the choice bird. 'His eftpos machine wasn't connecting so it was taking a while to process, and I felt really uncomfortable as he was clearly agitated, huffing and throwing things around,' she said. Ms Bartholomew claims the man working at Sam The Butcher in Bondi swore at her and told her to leave, but the man working at the time said his customer was the one being rude . The chicken (pictured in front of Aidan Guerra) was cooked by Ms Bartholomew as part of a Game Of Thrones-inspired feast . 'Another woman entered the shop at this point and she ordered sausages and paid in cash, and when she asked for a receipt he clearly ignored her on purpose so she actually lent over the counter and printed her own.' However, the butcher vehemently denies he called Ms Bartholomew names and said she was the one being rude on a day when he had been having issues with his eftpos machine. 'She's just a troublemaker,' the butcher told Daily Mail Australia. 'I was very slow and she started having a go at me.' Ms Bartholomew (pictured with Mr Guerra) said the butcher told her to 'go to a f***ing Aussie butcher' But the man working vehemently denied any claims he swore at or abused the young woman (pictured) He told Daily Mail Australia that he's trying to fit into Australian life but sometimes finds it hard to cope with attitudes in Bondi. Ms Bartholomew claims the butcher then asked her 'Why don't you just go to a f***ing Aussie butcher'. 'She said I'm half Italian don't speak to me like that,' the butcher said. 'I said if you're going to be rude to me just take the chicken and go.' 'It's a free country there's about eight butcher shops in Bondi,' he added. Ms Bartholomew (left) and the butcher both said she didn't end up paying for the chicken she and Mr Guerra (right) later ate . Ms Bartholomew said she had decided to leave the shop without making a purchase but the butcher then thrust the chicken at her. 'I said not to worry about it and proceeded to leave while my purchase was still pending so he swiped the 1.5kg chicken at me and told me to ""take it and f*** off"",' she claims. 'I think I was just the victim of racial abuse,' the young Bondi woman wrote in a heated Facebook post shortly afterwards. However the butcher said he simply wanted her out of the shop and did not swear at or abuse her at any stage. 'She didn't even end up paying for the chicken, she got a free chicken,' he said. Ms Bartholomew told Daily Mail Australia 'I have never been to this particular butcher before.' 'I'm going to assume it wasn't me who he was really angry at, however I just happened to be in there at the time.'","Belinda Bartholomew claims she was racially abused at a Bondi butcher .

"All the smiles cannot hide the reality that McCluskey and his union are a potent, sinister force in British politics . Out on the election campaign trail under blue skies in South Wales, the trade union firebrand's manner was as warm as the weather. 'Didn't you once call me a slab-faced Marxist?' the famously militant leader of Unite asked me with a grin that was more genial than menacing. I had to confess I had. But that did not stop 'Red' Len McCluskey giving me the time of day on a street in Neath as he conducted a two-day tour of the Principality to drum up support for Labour's cause. Watching him in action, it was clear that he is highly popular with activists. His gospel of traditional hard-left socialism goes down well with the converted, as does his hackneyed anti-Conservative bile. 'We look to Wales as a beacon of hope to show what a Labour government can do. The Tories might have the money but we've got the working people on our side,' he said to cheers and applause. Yet all the smiles cannot hide the reality that McCluskey and his union are a potent, sinister force in British politics, seeking to use their financial and organisational muscle within the Labour movement to drag Britain back to the dark days of the 1970s. As the Mail reveals today, the sheer scale of the influence Unite holds on scores of Labour candidates is chilling given the socialist revolution the union would seek to impose. Indeed, McCluskey, a former Liverpool dock worker who keeps a drawing of Lenin in his office and once boasted of presiding over more strikes than any other union boss, is quite open about his yearning for that period when the unions held the government to ransom: 'We are supposed to believe that the Seventies was a horrible time. It wasn't. It was a time of great advances for working people,' he has said. Labour's umbilical link to McCluskey's union has received much less attention in recent days than a potential deal with the left-wing, anti-austerity SNP, yet it is just as potentially disastrous for the governance of this country. Not only is Unite – which has a claimed membership of 1.42million – intertwined with the Labour Party's structure, MPs and finances, but it also remains addicted to the failed socialist policies of the past, including a major expansion in the public sector, less flexibility in the workplace, higher taxation and ever more state spending. Just like Nicola Sturgeon, McCluskey wants to make Labour bolder, 'more radical, courageous and brave'. Only last month, he appeared to threaten illegal action if a Tory Government pushed through further restrictions on strikes in the public sector. 'When the law is misguided, when it oppresses people and removes their freedoms, can we respect it? I am not really posing the question, I'm giving the answer. It ain't going to happen,' he declared. Despite all his talk about the oppression of working people, however, he has not done badly for himself. Last year it was revealed he received a £5,000 rise, taking his pay and pensions package to £140,281. McCluskey has denied that he has too much influence over Ed Miliband, adding that Unite is supporting the party '100 per cent' McCluskey's determination to influence Labour was all too evident in Wales. With an air of quasi-regal grandeur, he visited several factories, gave talks to Labour activists and held a number of photo opportunities – including one in Cardiff at the statute of that old champagne socialist Nye Bevan. When I spoke to McCluskey, he downplayed his hardline socialism, instead talking about the need for investment in industry and the economy. And he denied that he had too much influence over Ed Miliband's party: 'If only that were true,' he said, while proclaiming his loyalty to the cause. 'Unite is supporting Labour 100 per cent,' he said, adding that is now campaigning 'all over the country'. Yet there was something synthetic about McCluskey's protestations of support for Labour. As I watched him at close quarters, it became more apparent that he was going through the motions. When asked in an interview with BBC Radio Wales about Miliband's leadership, McCluskey could say only: 'He's doing OK'. Beneath the surface, I have no doubt he longs to hear Ed offering more nakedly socialist policies, rather than trying to appeal to Middle England. Moreover, if Labour and Unite really think that McCluskey is an asset in the election, they are doing their best to keep quiet about it. When I tried to find out McCluskey's schedule for his Welsh visit from any number of Unite and Labour sources, including McCluskey's own press officer, I was greeted with either hostility or silence. No one would give me any information. It was only through persistence and good luck that I managed to track him down, to the outrage of his press officer who asked me paranoiacally: 'How did you find us? Did you fit a tracking device to Len's car?' That kind of anxiety and suspicion shows more than just a lack of confidence. It reveals a fear that, just as with Sturgeon's spendthrift radicalism, the hard-Left dogma of Unite is likely to alienate floating middle-of-the-road voters. Such fears are, of course, only too justified. For this is no small-town demagogue. On the contrary, McCluskey is pivotal to Labour's future because of the stranglehold his union has over the party. It was Unite and the other affiliated unions that ensured Ed Miliband was elected leader in 2010 against his more moderate brother David, who enjoyed greater popularity among Labour MPs and the rank and file. Since 2010, Unite is estimated to have donated at least £14.4million to Labour's coffers. It was Unite and the other affiliated unions that ensured Ed Miliband (pictured left) was elected leader in 2010 against his more moderate brother David (right) The dominance of Unite runs right through Labour's organisation, with huge implications for the make-up of a putative Miliband government. One recent analysis showed that 159 Labour MPs from the last parliament receive sponsorship from Unite or are members of the union, including senior frontbenchers such as Harriet Harman, Angela Eagle, Hilary Benn and Sadiq Khan. In addition, 133 Labour candidates at this election are reported to have links to Unite. As Martin Mayer, chairman of Unite's political committee and a member of Labour's National Executive recently admitted, the union is involved in a 'serious attempt to win back the party'. Tragically for Britain, there is now a real danger that an incoming Labour government would be forced to lurch even further to the Left, not just by SNP by also by Unite, with Miliband too weak to stand up to those who are determined he will be their puppet in Downing Street.","The scale of influence Unite holds is chilling given what it seeks to impose .

"The battle of the batteries is hotting up. Reports claim Google is the latest firm to set up a team dedicated to boosting how long our phones, tablets and even electric cars can run for. And sources said the four-man team spends its days devising and testing different technologies from the flexible to the wearable. Reports claim Google is the latest firm to set up a team dedicated to boosting how long our phones, tablets and even electric cars (pictured) can run for. Sources told the Wall Street Journal that the four-man team spends its days devising and testing different technologies from the flexible to the wearable . The reports were made by Alistair Barr in the Wall Street Journal. Google has been working on similar projects since 2012 when former Apple battery expert Dr Ramesh Bhardwaj began leading a testing team. Mr Barr explained that Dr. Bhardwaj recently described how 'solid-state, thin-film batteries could be used in smartphones and other mobile devices that are thinner, bendable, wearable and even implantable in the human body.' He also referenced a video for Project Loon that revealed how Google has been working with experts at AllCell Technologies to develop batteries that function at subfreezing temperatures. This is vital for Google's Project Loon balloons designed to float near the stratosphere and provide internet to wider areas. Google has been working on similar projects since 2012 when former Apple battery expert Dr Ramesh Bhardwaj began leading a testing team. In a video for Project Loon (pictured), Google revealed it has been working with experts at AllCell Technologies to develop batteries that function at subfreezing temperatures . Fan site AppleInsider recently spotted nine job listings on Apple's official recruitment site in the past month that relate to batteries. These include one for an iOS battery life software engineer (pictured left) and another for iOS software power systems engineer (pictured right) The AllCell technology uses wax and a graphite material, for example, to help lithium-ion batteries absorb heat and spread it across the power pack. Last week, a team of Stanford University chemists unveiled an aluminium battery that can recharge in less than 60 seconds. Apple defines the Apple Watch battery on its Watch product page. It says its all-day battery life is based on 18 hours of use. All-day battery life: This includes 90 time checks, 90 notifications, 45 minutes of app use, and a 30-minute workout with music. Audio playback: The battery will last up to 6.5 hours when playing music. Talk time: Apple said the Watch can be used for up to three hours for calls. Workout: During this test the Watch lasted for seven hours when a workout session was active and the heart rate sensor was on. Watch: When used as a watch the device will last for 48 hours if checked five times an hour. Power reserve: When the Apple Watch's battery  gets low it switches into Power Reserve mode letting users tell the time for up to 72 hours - with four time checks an hour. Charging time: The company said it takes 1.5 hours to charge the Watch to 80% and 2.5 hours for a full charge. Apple's tests were carried out in March 2015 with a pre-production Apple Watch and software paired with an iPhone using pre-production software. Apple said battery life varies with environmental factors, use, configuration, and 'many other factors' so actual results will vary . It is said to be the first high-performance aluminium battery which is 'fast-charging, long-lasting and inexpensive' and is more environmentally friendly than alkaline batteries. It also can't catch fire like lithium-ion technology. At present the rechargeable aluminium battery generates about two volts of electricity, the highest achieved yet with aluminium,'  but the researchers said the battery has only half the voltage of existing technology. And Google isn't the only tech giant working on such plans. Last month, Apple began recruiting for experts to help boost the battery across its range of mobiles and laptops. At least nine job listings were discovered by fan site AppleInsider and include listings for an iOS battery life software engineer, a software power systems engineer, battery pack engineering manager and a cell engineer. In particular, the iOS software power systems engineer role said the successful candidate 'will be working on design and development of software for triage of battery life issues, modeling of power consumed by different parts of the system, and analytics to understand large scale battery life trends.' Atmel also recently announced its latest microcontrollers (MCUs) that can be fitted to a variety of gadgets and are so low power they can harvest energy from a person's body. The  SAM L microcontrollers are part of Atmel's 32-bit ARM-based MCU range and are powered by chip maker ARM's Cortex M0+ 32-bit processors. A number of Apple devices, including the iPhone 5S and iPad Air are powered by chips based around ARM technology. A team of Stanford University chemists recently unveiled an aluminium battery that can fully recharge in less than 60 seconds. It is said to be the first high-performance aluminium battery which is 'fast-charging, long-lasting and inexpensive' and is more environmentally friendly than alkaline batteries . Last month, Atmel released its latest microcontrollers (MCUs) for a variety of gadgets that are so low power they can even harvest energy from a person's body. Atmel said its MCUs extend 'battery life from years to decades, reducing the number of times batteries need to be changed in devices' Atmel said its MCUs extend 'battery life from years to decades, reducing the number of times batteries need to be changed in devices such as fire alarms, healthcare, medical, wearable, and devices placed in rural, agriculture, offshore and other remote areas.' They use a third of the power of rival chips and tests have shown they are the lowest power microprocessor ever made. The microcontrollers run on the firm's picoPower technology and Atmel's Event System that makes different parts of the device work together to carry out tasks. By effectively 'sharing' energy, the whole device uses less power and, subsequently, less battery. It can also manage how much energy is being used by other components to make them as efficient as possible. Plus, the technology is so low power it can harvest energy from the body using changes in temperature. During a demonstration of the microcontrollers at this year's CES, Andreas Eieland, Atmel's director of product marketing demonstrated how he could power a radio by placing his hand on a panel. This panel recognised a change in temperature between the hand and the room and this was harvested to create charge .","Reports claim Google is latest firm to test alternative battery options .

"A gun trafficker for convicted killer Aaron Hernandez said he was 'awed' by the former New England Patriots star when he sent him an assault rifle and a pair of handguns a month before Odin Lloyd’s killing. Oscar 'Papoo' Hernandez Jr - no relation to the disgraced NFL player - has pleaded guilty to weapons charges in connection to his infamous namesake’s murder case. Earlier this month, Aaron Hernandez, 25, was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for first-degree murder of the semi-professional football player in 2013. Scroll down for video . Bad bro-mance: Oscar Hernandez Jr (left), 24, said he was 'awed' by New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez (right) and 'grateful to be noticed' when the football player paid him $15,000 for three guns . Unfortunate timing: Oscar Hernandez  shipped his namesake a rifle and two handguns in April 2013 - a month before the NFL player shot dead Odin Lloyd (pictured on screen in court) Hernandez had been a rising star in the NFL with a $41million contract when he was arrested in June of that year. In a sentencing memo in Oscar Hernandez’s weapons case released this week to Boston Herald the 24-year-old Florida man stated that he was blinded by the football player's fame ,'grateful to be noticed [by him], and had no way of anticipating the terrible events which would follow.' Although Oscar Hernandez was never called to testify against Aaron Hernandez during his trial earlier this month, his lawyer wrote in the memorandum to Judge William Young that his client was beaten by fellow inmates at the Wyatt Detention Center 'after having been incorrectly listed as a government witness.' Following the attack, Oscar Hernandez spent some time in solitary confinement at the Rhode Island jail. Mr Hernandez, a father from Belle Glen, Florida, is now facing up to 30 months in prison after pleading guilty in January to charges of transporting firearms across state lines; obstruction of justice; lying to a federal grand jury and witness tampering. Justice for Odin: The 25-year-old athlete (left) was found guilty April 15 of first-degree murder in the 2013 shooting death of the semi-professional football player (right) The confessed gun smuggler was scheduled to be sentenced Monday, but Judge Young has delayed the punishment phase until May 5. Public defender Charles McGinty, who represents Hernandez, is seeking a sentence of one year and one day for his client. Investigators said the Florida resident shipped three guns including FEG 7.62x39 Hungarian rifle, to Aaron Hernandez in the spring of 2013. The weapons had been stashed inside a beat-up Toyota Camry that was found in the football player's garage in North Attleboro, Massachusetts. A friend of Oscar Hernandez testified during the NFL star’s trial that the gun trafficker purchased the weapons April 16, 2013, five days after Aaron transferred $15,000 into his account. Oscar Hernandez was arrested April 17, 2014, and indicted by a grand jury in Massachusetts on gun trafficking charges. Back behind bars: Following the sentencing phase, Hernandez was handcuffed and returned to jail. He has since been transferred to a maximum-security facility . The indictment stated that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives had traced three guns that had been recovered during the investigation of Odin Lloyd's killing. The ATF determined that all three guns were purchased in Florida in April 2013. Massachusetts officials said they have been unable to find the gun used to kill Lloyd, which they've identified as a .45-caliber Glock. None of the three guns mentioned in Oscar Hernandez's indictment is a .45-caliber Glock. Meanwhile, his notorious namesake was transferred last week to the maximum security state Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center in Shirley to begin serving his life sentence. Aaron Hernandez is also awaiting a trial date for the 2012 homicides of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado.","Oscar Hernandez Jr has pleaded guilty to transporting firearms, obstruction of justice, lying to a federal grand jury and witness tampering .

"Visitors to a metro-Detroit museum have a chance to get an up-close look at the chair Abraham Lincoln was shot in at Washington D.C.'s Ford's Theatre in 1865 next week as the museum puts it center stage. The red, worn chair will be removed from its enclosure at Dearborn's Henry Ford Museum and displayed in an open plaza on April 15 as part of the museum's observance of the assassination's 150 anniversary. Two days earlier, it will be onstage when renowned historian and Lincoln expert Doris Kearns Goodwin delivers a sold-out lecture at The Henry Ford. The chair in which Abraham Lincoln was shot has been on display at The Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan, for 85 years. On April 15, it will be removed from its encasing to be displayed for the 150th anniversary of the assassination . Abraham Lincoln (left) was shot in Ford's Theatre in Washington D.C. on April 14, 1865 by pro-Confederacy actor, John Wilkes Booth (right). Lincoln died from his injuries the next day . The chair has a dark stain on the back, which many visitors believe to be blood from the shooting. But historians at the museum say that the stain is oil from other people's heads who sat in the chair before Lincoln . Lincoln's chair has been part of the museum started by pioneering automaker Henry Ford - no relation to the theater-owning Ford family - since its founding 85 years ago. The government removed it from the theater and held it as evidence, and it ended up at the Smithsonian Institution. The wife of a theater co-owner petitioned to reclaim it, then sold it at auction to an agent working for Henry Ford. Henry Ford also bought the Logan County Courthouse where Lincoln practiced law in Illinois in the 1840s and moved it to the outdoor area next to his museum known as Greenfield Village. For decades, the theater chair was housed in that courthouse. Around 1980, the chair was placed inside the museum, where it's now part of the 'With Liberty and Justice for All' exhibit. 'Lincoln was one of Henry Ford's heroes - when he decided he wanted to have this village, he wanted to collect Lincoln stuff as an educational tool,' said curator Donna Braden. 'The courthouse is pretty much the first thing Henry Ford acquired related to Lincoln and the chair came soon after.' A playbill from Our American Cousin from the night President Abraham Lincoln was assassinated on April 14, 1865 is shown on display at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn . A copy of a hand colored 1870 lithographic print by Gibson & Co. provided by the U.S. Library of Congress shows John Wilkes Booth shooting U.S. President Abraham Lincoln as he sits in the presidential box at Ford's Theatre . A copy of a 1865 lithographic print by Currier & Ives provided by the U.S. Library of Congress shows the same event from a different angle . Many visitors wonder whether dark spots on the back of the chair are Lincoln's blood. Not so, say museum workers: The stains are oil from other people's heads who sat in the chair before that fateful night when Lincoln was shot by a pro-Confederacy actor, John Wilkes Booth. Steve Harris, a historic presenter at the museum, tells passers-by that Lincoln's head would have been positioned much higher than the stain because he was 6ft, 4in tall. Taking in objects from the final hours of two important American lives is a major draw to the museum. The Henry Ford also owns the limousine President John F. Kennedy was riding in when he was fatally shot in Dallas nearly a century later. Museum officials say the chair and car are among the most visited artifacts in the museum, along with the bus Rosa Parks rode in when she refused to give up her seat to a white rider and helped spark the civil rights movement. Ford's Theatre in Washington D.C. has arranged the presidential box identically to the way it was the night Lincoln was shot through the doorway . Abraham Lincoln's iconic silk top hat, which he was wearing the night he was assassinated, is part of the museum display at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C. Goodwin, author of 'Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln,' told The Associated Press that the chair will offer an extra 'dimension' to her words and the experience of those in the room. 'There's an intimacy to it that catapults you back in time,' she said. 'And hopefully, along with that, you're not just thinking of the death but the life that made it worthwhile.' Museum visitor Jeff Buczkiewicz stood before the chair, peered silently into the glass-enclosed case at the rocking chair, then snapped pictures for posterity . 'You just get drawn into these things,' said Buczkiewicz, 47, who came from suburban Chicago with his family to the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan. 'It is a tragic part of our history and our country. I think it's important to take it all in.' Milestone anniversaries seem to add to the impact of objects like the chair and limo. About 8,000 people visited the limo on November 22, 2013, a free-admission day marking the 50th anniversary of JFK's assassination, so the chair is likely to draw plenty of visitors on the Lincoln anniversary, which also has free admission. The single-shot Deringer pistol John Wilkes Booth used to kill Abraham Lincoln is displayed at the Center for Education and Leadership at Ford's Theatre in Washington . 'It really is about the power of the artifact,' said Patricia Mooradian, president of The Henry Ford, as the entire history attraction is known. 'It's less about the artifact itself than the symbolic nature of the artifact that represents a great paradigm change in the history of our country,' she added. Buskiewicz has also visited Dealey Plaza in Dallas where Kennedy was assassinated. 'You just have to try to take it in when you're in those areas,' he said, but he wonders 'why we gravitate' toward places and things associated with these types of events. Goodwin, whose book helped inspire Steven Spielberg's movie, 'Lincoln,' says that standing before iconic yet everyday objects provides a deep experience that transcends the moment that made them famous. 'In some ways, it's more familiar when it's a chair, a bus or a limo,' she said. 'There's something about the tangibility of these things.' The chair in which Lincoln was show is regularly displayed in an encasing at The Henry Ford Museum. For the 150th anniversary it will be taken out of the encasing .","The Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan, has had chair for 85 years .

"Tottenham are considering a state-of-the-art stadium with a retractable pitch that enables them to become the home of a new NFL London franchise. The bold design of the new £400million stadium, due to be completed for the start of the 2018-19 season, could involve a ‘slide-out’ grass football pitch with an NFL-style synthetic surface housed underneath. The option of extra-large changing rooms, to accommodate NFL squad sizes that can amount to as many as 70 players at a game, is also being explored by architects. Tottenham are considering sharing their new £400m stadium with an NFL franchise . A spokesman for the north London club did not rule out the possibility this week, confirming that they are ‘looking at options’ in order to ‘future-proof the design’. The NFL is said to be within five years of having a permanent franchise in London. Indeed officials will be testing logistics when they stage their three games at Wembley this autumn, with teams looking at how quickly they can have their players back in the USA and ready to play again. The clash between the Buffalo Bills and Jacksonville Jaguars on October 25 will kick-off at 1.30pm while the New York Jets vs Miami Dolphins game on October 4 and Detroit Lions vs Kansas City Chiefs contest on November 1 will both begin at 2.30pm. As well as allowing the NFL to experiment with a live game on TV at breakfast time in the States (9.30am Eastern time), teams are able to take advantage of the time difference and be home on American soil by Sunday night. Tottenham's new state-of-the-art stadium is due to be ready in time for the 2018-19 season . Spurs' new 65,000 capacity stadium could be better suited to the NFL than the 90,000-seat Wembley . If Tottenham press ahead with the proposed stadium design and secure the NFL franchise it would represent a significant blow to the FA, who also see the NFL as a potentially lucrative partner for Wembley, their £757m stadium. But the NFL are keeping their options open at this stage in the knowledge that a new London stadium designed with American football requirements in mind would be hugely advantageous. Even the proposed capacity of 65,000 for the new White Hart Lane is a more realistic target than 90,000 seats which Wembley boasts. Wembley does have the iconic status that the NFL finds attractive but there are other issues with the national stadium. Not least the fact that they have to leave the lowest 5,000 seats empty so that the view of spectators is not restricted by the mass of huge bodies on the touchline. The modern NFL stadiums make sight-lines for spectators a priority and the new White Hart Lane could overcome the problem that is experienced at Wembley by having the artificial pitch at a significantly lower level beneath the moveable grass pitch. Wembley has hosted NFL regular-season matches since the International Series began in 2007 . Detroit Lions' clash with Atlanta Falcons kicked off early, as will all three games at Wembley later this year . Retractable grass pitches are nothing new in modern stadia design. England have played on two: at Gelsenkirchen in Germany during the 2006 World Cup and in the Sapporo Dome in Japan four years earlier. The Gelredome in Holland also has a retractable pitch, as does the University of Phoenix Stadium that hosted this year’s Super Bowl. The advantage for these stadiums is the ability to grow the grass in a more natural environment, outside, away from the shadows of the stands while also having the capacity to stage different events without damaging the playing surface. A feat of modern engineering, a pitch can be moved outside the stadium in less than four hours. A spokesman for Tottenham said: ‘The club has always seen the new stadium as being at the heart of the regeneration of the area and it is important, therefore, to look at how we future-proof the design, as well as increasing the functionality of the stadium, whilst being conscious of community uses. At this stage it is about looking at options but nothing more.’","Tottenham's new £400m stadium due to be completed for 2018-19 season .

"A pensioner is living in fear after his Jack Russell saved him from a badger the size of a large pig with six-inch teeth. Shocked Terry Cooper, 79, was enjoying the sunshine in his garden with his dog Sam when the huge animal burst through a hedge with two cubs. Mr Cooper, from Curry Rivel, Somerset said his dog  dragged him back indoors and fears he could have been attacked if his pet had not been there. Scroll down for video .

The retired charity worker said: 'I've got a little Jack Russell and I took him out just after tea at 5pm. 'Suddenly there was a badger and two little'uns in my garden. 'He was the size of a pig, with teeth about six inches long. They were as long as a lemonade bottle is wide.' 'My dog turned me round and quickly pulled me in,' Mr Cooper added. 'The badger didn't attack me, so I didn't seek medical attention, but I was left badly shaken.

Alex Stevens, South West regional policy advisor, said: 'Badgers are protected by law and people shouldn't be interfering with badgers or setts. 'This incident is really unusual and surprising, given the time at which it happened. But badgers are pretty headstrong. I suspect he was searching for an easy source of food. 'Badgers can squeeze through any gaps in fences or hedges which are bigger than 7.5 centimetres. So if you have fencing with the slats spaced more narrowly, that will help. 'Even better, people can protect their property through badger-proof fencing. This goes a foot or two into the ground so that badgers cannot tunnel underneath it. 'People should also keep the lids on their bins, and if they have a dog or a cat, don't leave their food or water bowls out in the open.

"(CNN)It is a city transformed, swollen in size but shrunken in scope, anxiously awaiting what comes next. On Kabul's streets, you can easily find the uneasy legacy of America's longest war. Outside one mosque -- mixing with other men desperate for a day's worth of casual manual labor -- are five men who months ago had one valuable skill NATO depended upon: they speak English. Now however, their world has turned upon them. They were, each for a different reason -- each for a reason they do not understand -- all fired from their jobs and then blacklisted, they say, meaning they can no longer get work with other government groups or NGOs here. The skill they once thrived off has left them isolated, and fearing reprisals. They sleep in market stalls, and avoid traveling to see their families in case the threats they face are visited upon them. ""My family is still living in the provinces,"" one of the men tells me. ""I cannot go there. I am living in a market, in one of the empty shops."" Another adds: ""My family, everybody, give up on me, they are nervous."" A third man -- all requested anonymity -- says: ""Right now I sleep here, on the street, in this mosque area."" ""We are in prison in Afghanistan,"" a fourth says. The U.S. Embassy and NATO declined to comment for this story. EXCLUSIVE: The last Americans in Afghanistan . Helicopters still buzz around the capital. Its population is five times what it was when NATO arrived here, even by the most conservative estimates, and the violence in the provinces means people swell it further still -- arriving in Kabul's dusty, mountainous bowl of a city in order to avoid the fighting. Neighborhoods that were once massively over-priced cliques of foreigners living in ""poppy palaces"" -- villas allegedly bought from profiteers of the opium trade -- are now empty. One road, forever pot-holed in the past decade, is now being covered over by Afghans who, it seems, are finally reclaiming that street. Even Chicken Street, the hackneyed pedestrian shopping road where new Western arrivals would buy carpets or local trinkets, is more or less deserted. One shopkeeper says it could be the embassy security warnings that are keeping people away now. It is the same for the restaurants here that used to brim with contractors and NGO workers. They are now empty, the sound of their heavy metal doors echoing across deserted tables. It is immeasurably different to three years ago when I lived there. Drive out east -- past the women in burqas who sit on road bumps, holding their children, hoping drivers will slow enough to throw them change -- and you see roads lined with the detritus of America's war here. Huge lines of excavators, cherry-pickers, and forklift trucks sit idle. At times it seemed there was little America wouldn't do, or try, to meets its often fluid goals in the country. Yet today, the machines that could have once moved small mountains do little more than gather dust. EXCLUSIVE: Afghan woman forced to marry her rapist . Further down the road too are more winners-turned-losers of the NATO presence here. Vast supply chains once kept 120,000 troops fed and watered. Trucks lined the roads and climbed up to the military bases. Now the bases are gone, and the trucks that once supplied millions sit still. Their bosses may have fled abroad with their winnings, yet the drivers have been left behind, stuck with vehicles that cost them $30,000 to buy -- and $1,000 a year just to keep on the road -- but that would fetch just a tenth of that price now. ""The contracts were with big businessmen and commanders who were giving us very little and made themselves very rich and are now living comfortably in Dubai,"" one truck driver tells us. Yet still the wedding palaces proliferate. Along one stretch of road their endless, multiplying lights throb. Each night the houses seem packed -- the commitment to the future still is popular here, despite the uncertainty -- even if the lights that decorate them seem more and more like a symbol of leaving. One set actually replicates the shape of an expensive hotel in Dubai. The city's lights do shine staggeringly and often constantly -- something the Taliban never achieved during their rule here. NATO's efforts to keep them on are reported to have involved diesel power stations that cost billions but were barely switched on. The question many surely ask here -- as the last American troops prepare to retreat inside the U.S. Embassy by the end of next year -- is how much longer the lights will continue to glow.

"A chef has created a 10in-tall, half-kilogram burger piled with six forms of three different meats and containing a whopping 2,000 calories. The Whole Damn Farm, which costs £13.50, is the creation of Sam Longhurst, head chef of Splendid Kitchen, Manchester. He devised the mega meal - which contains two beef patties and a whole fried chicken thigh - after he was challenged by diners to create a burger containing three kinds of meat. The Whole Damn Farm burger features two beef burgers, homemade bacon jam, ham chunks, a whole chicken thigh, barbequed pulled pork and bacon rashers . Ready, get set, go! Customer Angela Fox gets ready to take on the mighty meat challenge . The monstrous meat feast has two beef burgers weighing 220g, a layer of homemade bacon jam, 100g of ham chunks and a 150g whole battered and fried chicken thigh. Added to that is 80g of barbequed pulled pork and four rashers of bacon all sandwiched between two brioche buns. With a meat equivalent of six Big Macs the burger was created after a customer presented with the restaurant's 'Cow & Chicken' burger - a feast in its own right - remarked, 'It's almost the whole damn farm.' Mr Longhurst said: 'We are always up for a challenge and when a customer seemed disappointed by a burger that only contained beef and chicken, we knew we had to take it one step further. 'You could say we've taken it several steps further as there are six different forms of meat on there. I think it'll keep the punters satisfied.' The head chef joined forces with owner Mike Edge to set out to achieve what might constitute a whole farmyard of animals in one meal. Chef Sam Longhurst from the Splendid Kitchen restaurant in Manchester with his mega burger . Encased between a semi-brioche bun are: . Two beef burgers weighing 220g . Layer of homemade bacon jam . 100g of ham chunks . A whole chicken thigh weighing 150g . 80g of barbequed pulled pork . Four rashers of bacon . Mr Longhurst, who lives in Salford with his wife and eight-year-old son Matthew, said: 'It's amusing when people are cocky and decide to go for it, as it's a monster of a burger and they don't realise that. I have only just managed to eat it myself. 'It's loads of fun making stuff that's a little bit ridiculous. I experiment with cooking at home too. 'Matthew and I will make homemade burgers stuffed with cheese and cold meats, so I think of The Whole Damn Farm burger as a supersized version of that. 'I think Matthew would be scared of it, to be honest, a burger the same size as his head.' Mr Edge said: 'We wanted something show-stopping; we haven't gone down the road of using crisps and sweets as toppings, where it starts to get silly.

"(CNN)Hillary Clinton's campaign-in-waiting met on Saturday in its Brooklyn headquarters, a day before the former secretary of state officially announces her campaign for president, according to a Democrat who attended the meeting. Robby Mook, Clinton's soon-to-be campaign manager, distributed a ""values statement"" at the meeting that outlined what the campaign will stand for, what their goals are and how they plan to win -- something Clinton failed to do in 2008. The campaign's purpose, the document states, is ""to give every family, every small business, and every American a path to lasting prosperity by electing Hillary Clinton the next President of the United States."" The document makes clear that the campaign will try to avoid mistakes that plagued Clinton's failed 2008 run. Many of the ""guiding principles"" in the memo mention issues that sunk Clinton's first campaign. The document, according to the source, includes the ideas from Mook, along with a wide array of Clinton's soon-to-be staffers and advisers. The memo maintains that the campaign must remain humble, disciplined and united, something voters in Iowa and others states have said Clinton did not do in 2008. ""This campaign is not about Hillary Clinton and not about us,"" reads the document that was obtained by CNN. In the section about the campaign's guiding principles, the document reads, ""We are humble: We take nothing for granted, we are never afraid to lose, we always outcompete and fight for every vote we can win. We know this campaign will be won on the ground, in states."" It also calls on campaign staffers to remain ""disciplined"" and ""open to a diverse range of views."" ""When we disagree, it's never personal. Once a decision is made, we execute it -- together,"" reads the memo. ""We know there will be tough days, but we will bounce back and get back to work."" The document also appears to telegraph the name to Clinton's campaign: ""Hillary for America."" Clinton is planning to launch her presidential candidacy on Sunday through a video message on social media, according to Democratic sources.

"(CNN)Civil unions between people of the same sex will soon be recognized in Chile. The country joined several of its South American neighbors in allowing the unions when President Michelle Bachelet enacted a new law on Monday. ""This is a concrete step in the drive to end the difference between homosexual and heterosexual couples,"" Bachelet said. The new law will take effect in six months. It will give legal weight to cohabiting relationships between two people of the same sex and between a man and a woman. The Chilean government estimates that around 2 million people will be able to benefit from the change. The law is intended to end discrimination faced by common-law couples, such as not being allowed to visit partners in hospital, make medical decisions on their behalf or decide what to do with their remains. It also gives the couples greater rights in the realms of property, health care, pensions and inheritance. A number of South American nations have moved to allow same-sex civil unions in recent years.

"A device has been created that can scan entire planes for contraband, bombs and weapons. The mobile X-ray scanner, heralded as the world’s first ‘airplane scanner’, sweeps down a plane and can detect various objects inside. While the radiation emitted by the scanner is not safe yet for humans to be in the plane when it is operated, the company behind it thinks it could become a vital tool in aircraft safety. Scroll down for video . Romanian company MB Telecom has revealed the Roboscan 2M Aeria. It uses a cone of radiation to sweep across planes (shown) and look inside. The device is accurate enough to find a filament in a light bulb. But the radiation it emits is not safe for passengers yet . The Roboscan 2M Aeria is being developed by Romanian company MB Telecom (MBT). It costs €3 million (£2.1 million, $3.2 million), reported The Times, and is apparently already being used to check trucks at borders in Eastern Europe, where it has helped seize 76,000 packs of illegal cigarettes. On its website, MBT says the Aeria is ‘the very first solution for aircraft security inspection.’ It can scan planes from small private jets to medium-sized commercial airplanes. The company notes that, while passengers and their luggage are thoroughly inspected at airports, there is no such inspection process for jets arriving at small private airports with low security. But with their device, the company says this ‘gap’ in aviation security can be plugged, and it can scan an entire plane in about 20 minutes. The device can be used to detect weapons (shown) and other contraband in small or medium-sized jets that land at low-security airports . An operator working inside the truck can look inside the entirety of a plane, although currently under regulations some areas of the plane - such as the fuselage and wings - are restricted . There are four main components that allow an aircraft to be scanned. Armed with a sharp sense of smell, dogs have a long history of detecting explosives for their human handlers, and soon there could be sniffer elephants too. Researchers have found that the large mammals excel at identifying explosives by smell, stirring speculation about whether their extraordinary ability could save lives. Elephants could be used to detect land mines in areas that have seen conflict and could even do so at a distance with the aid of drones. The research was conducted in South Africa and involved the U.S. military. The first is the operating truck, from which an operator can use the system and look inside the plane. Attached to this is a robotic arm with an X-ray generator at the end. The plane is then pulled forwards by a battery-operated tug over a wide detection module. By firing X-rays out of the arm, a cone of radiation sweeps over the plane. The operator inside the truck is then given live images of the interior of the plane, and is able to scan its entirety for hidden items. It is apparently so accurate that it could pick out keys on a seat or even a filament in a light bulb. One issue, though, is that aircraft operators do not authorities to inspect the whole plane - areas of the fuselage and the wings are off limits, even though Roboscan can examine these areas. ‘You cannot touch it, but you can scan it,’ said Radu Tudor of MBT at the Counter Terror Expo in London this week. There are four main components that allow an aircraft to be scanned. The first is the operating truck (shown), from which an operator can use the system and look inside the plane .

"The Ministry of Defence was under fire after vital details of the RAF's main base on the Falklands Islands were published on their website. The secret document, which has the exact GPS co-ordinates of vital facilities as well as information on the depth of concrete on the runway were published unencrypted on the MoD's website. The details could be used as 'an invasion guide' by Argentina, with the technical information providing excellent intelligence to any Argentine bombers sent to attack the islands. The Falklands Islands are defended by a squadron of RAF Typhoon aircraft operating from Mount Pleasant aerodrome on West Falkland, supported by a refueling tanker to extend their operational area . The aerodrome also operates as a Search and Rescue location with Sea King helicopters, pictured . The airstrip, pictured, is home to four Europfighter Typhoon aircraft tasked with defending the islands . The Aerodrome Manual was accidentally uploaded onto a public section of the MoD's website and could have been downloaded by Argentine intelligence agents to help prepare a mission to recapture the islands. A senior military source told The Express: 'This is exactly the kind of intel foreign powers send spies to get. 'It's practically an invasion handbook. Taking out the runway could cripple Britain's ability to fight off invaders in the ongoing sovereignty dispute.' The MoD admitted the manual had been available on the internet but the link had been disabled. They denied the information was particularly sensitive. The blunder occurred as Argentina was described as a 'very live threat' by Defence Secretary Michael Fallon. This comes as Argentina is preparing to lease 12 Sukhoi SU-24 long-range bombers from Russia. The Falklands Islands are defended by modern Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft, supported by Rapier surface-to-air missiles and 1,200 troops. The Royal Navy also patrols the area and nuclear-powered submarines are also thought regularly travel to the region. And the MoD recently announced the £228million purchase of new anti-aircraft missiles to boost island defences. The jets are housed in hangers just off the main runway where they can be airborne quickly to intercept any potential aircraft inbound from Argentina in the event of a new conflict . Argentina is considering leasing 12 Suhkoi SU-24 bombers, pictured, from Russia. The Cold War-era jets have a range of 650 miles and would be able to bomb Mount Pleasant without the need to refuel . The MoD published the Aerodrome Manual on their website where it could be downloaded by anyone . The Cold War-era jet has a maximum range of 650 miles - which means it could attack the Falklands Islands and return to Argentina without the need to refuel. It also can carry 3,000kg of bombs as well as air-to-air missiles. The jets, despite being designed in the 1960s, are also capable of supersonic travel. This comes as tensions between Britain and Argentina have increased over plans by UK firms to drill for oil in the South Atlantic. Argentina's minister for the Malivinas - the name it uses for the Falklands Islands - Daniel Filmus threatened to prosecute any British firms exploring for oil near the islands. He said: 'The new exploration efforts to try to find hydrocarbons in the area carry a huge environmental risk. 'We want the owners of the companies to be tried according to Argentine laws and international statutes.' A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We have always been very clear that this is an unlawful assertion of jurisdiction over the Falklands Islands' continental shelf, which we reject, and we will raise it will the appropriate authorities. 'We are satisfied that the Islands have the right to develop their hydrocarbons sector as a legitimate commercial venture with international oil and gas companies, and will continue to support them as they move forward. Argentine domestic law does not apply to the Falkland Islands.'","The MoD accidentally published information on Falklands RAF base online .

"(CNN)Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin signed a bill on Friday that would allow the state to perform executions with nitrogen gas if lethal injection is ruled unconstitutional or becomes unavailable. Nitrogen causes a quick loss of consciousness and then death from lack of oxygen, Fallin's office said in a press release. CNN affiliate KFOR says it's never been used in an execution in the United States. ""The person will become unconscious within eight to 10 seconds and death a few minutes later. In other words, a humane, quick and painless death,"" said Rep. Mike Christian, one of the bill's authors, according to KFOR. Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, told the Washington Post that the same ""painless"" argument had been used to advance the use of lethal injections. ""The hasty manner in which this bill sped into law reflects the same lack of care with which Oklahoma has managed its execution process historically,"" he said. Oklahoma's executions have been put on hold while the U.S. Supreme Court reviews its use of lethal injections. Last year, the state came under scrutiny when it took 43 minutes to kill convicted killer Clayton Lockett. Fallin reaffirmed her support for the death penalty. ""Oklahoma executes murderers whose crimes are especially heinous,"" Fallin said. ""I support that policy, and I believe capital punishment must be performed effectively and without cruelty. The bill I signed today gives the state of Oklahoma another death penalty option that meets that standard."" The governor's office said the first alternative for execution is lethal injection, followed by nitrogen gas, the electric chair and the firing squad.","Nitrogen gas causes a quick loss of consciousness and then death from lack of oxygen, Oklahoma says .

"Attack: Sam Barton, who has had £55,000 of cosmetic surgery to look like Joey Essex, was egged on Easter Monday (pictured) 'Britain's vainest man' who had taxpayer-funded plastic surgery  to look like reality star Joey Essex said today he is being bullied online by a gang who have now  thrown eggs in his face. Sam Barton, who has had £55,000 of cosmetic surgery  - including two operations on the NHS - believes the culprits tracked him down using his Facebook posts and then attacked him in the street. The 22-year-old says abuse online about his appearance also forced him to move house. On Easter Monday he was attacked by a group of men who pelted him with eggs from a car. Sam had been enjoying a drink in the Green House pub in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, when a group of men shouted abuse at him as he left. The yobs then hurled six eggs at him before speeding off - leaving him with yolk and shell running down his face on the pavement. Sam said he believed he had been targeted because he had 'checked in' at the pub on Facebook minutes earlier. He said: 'It was quite a shock at first. I had just left the pub with two friends when I was suddenly pelted in eggs. 'There was shell in my hair and yolk dripping down my face. 'They shouted my name and swore at me as they drove past and threw eggs at me. 'They clearly didn't like me. It was not the kind of egg I was hoping to receive over the Easter holiday but after the shock had worn off I did have a laugh about it.' Scroll down for video . Sam had been taking part in filming with Geordie Shore star Vicky Pattison on Saturday April 4 - just two days before he was attacked. Spending: Barton has spent £20,000 on treatment for his teeth, around £5,000 on Botox, £2,000 on waxing and £2,500 on tanning treatment. Two nose jobs have cost £10,400, although one was free on the NHS . Pursuit of celebrity: Sam Barton has gone bankrupt financing plastic surgery and a champagne lifestyle to match his TOWIE heroes Joey Essex, together left, and Harry Derbidge, right . The pair spent the day being pampered at a beauty salon and then enjoying drinks in Birmingham for a reality show which will be aired on MTV. Debts: Barton admits he had debts of £100,000 on 15 credit cards and store cards trying to make it as a celeb . He also recently appeared on popular ITV show Judge Rinder to resolve a wrangle with a lapdancer friend over a Botox treatment row. Sam, who has spent £55,000 on perfecting his look, revealed in January he was going bankrupt after racking up debts of £35,000 on his Champagne lifestyle. Sam is the grandson of Aston Villa's European Cup winning boss Tony Barton and is best friends with Benefits Street star White Dee. Fame-hungry Sam previously revealed he had spent £55,000 on reconstructive surgery and beauty treatments to turn himself into the 'perfect man.' And he has amassed credit card debts of £25,000 in four years in search of the Joey Essex look that he hopes will make him a star. He has spent £20,000 on treatment for his teeth, around £5,000 on Botox, £2,000 on waxing and £2,500 on tanning treatment. Two nose jobs have cost £10,400, although one was free on the NHS. He admitted spending an astonishing £100,000 in just four years, blowing up to £2,000 a night on £300 bottles of expensive fizz. Sam, who lives with mum Jackie, dad Chris and brother Ed in Sutton Coldfield, plunged into the red after spending a fortune on plastic surgery. He added: 'I've spent around £55,000 trying to improve my looks and get the perfect image. 'The rest I've spent on designer clothes, jewellery, holidays, spa treatment and champagne. 'In total, I have spent around £100,000. At one point I counted 15 credit cards and store cards. 'I really do not regret it, I have had the time of my life over the last few years. 'My manager says this bankruptcy thing will clear my debts, so it's basically free money isn't it?'

"David Cameron will launch a multi-billion pound sale of Lloyds Bank shares if he wins the Election – in what would be the largest privatisation bonanza since the Thatcher era. The Prime Minister will today pledge that if he is returned to Downing Street he will offer the public £4 billion of Lloyds shares still held by the Government after Gordon Brown’s £20 billion panic bailout with taxpayers’ money during the 2008 economic crisis. Individuals will be allowed to buy up to £10,000 worth of Lloyds Banking Group shares, which were worth 78.7p when the stock market closed on Friday – comfortably above the 73.6p paid by Mr Brown’s government. Scroll down for video . David Cameron will launch a multi-billion pound sale of Lloyds Bank shares if he wins the Election . The shares will be offered at a discount of at least 5 per cent on the market rate at the time, with the proceeds used to help pay down the national debt. It is the latest ‘retro’ Conservative policy to hark back to the 1980s, following Mr Cameron’s revival in the manifesto of the Thatcherite ‘Right to Buy’ offer for housing association tenants. But while investors 30 years ago took overnight profits on their stakes in privatised companies such as British Gas and British Telecom – leading critics to claim that it encouraged ‘carpetbaggers’ – Lloyds shareholders will be encouraged to hang on to their holding. A loyalty bonus will be offered of one free share for every ten held for at least a year after the sale, up to a maximum bonus value of £200. The sale of Lloyds shares would be the biggest privatisation since the 1980s when Mrs Thatcher’s government sold £3.9 billion of BT shares and £5.6 billion of British Gas shares in the famous ‘Tell Sid’ campaign. Thirty-three major companies were privatised under Mrs Thatcher between 1984 and 1991, which supporters said led to a dramatic improvement in their efficiency and a boost to tax revenues for the Treasury. Like Right to Buy, it also helped to entrench Tory support among voters who benefited from the windfalls. No 10 strategists hope Mr Cameron’s pledge will remind voters of the economic problems that blighted the country under Mr Brown’s premiership. The recovery under Chancellor George Osborne has allowed him to sell £9 billion of shares in Lloyds to City investors for more than the price that former chancellor Alistair Darling paid in 2008. CLAIM: Jesse Norman and the chocolate cake he allegedly gave out while campaigning for re-election . Police are investigating a Tory MP over claims he attempted to bribe voters with chocolate cake. Jesse Norman allegedly gave out cake while campaigning for re-election at an Asda supermarket in his Hereford constituency. West Mercia Police last night said it was investigating reports of a breach of the Representation of the People Act 1983, which bans Election candidates from providing food, drink or entertainment in a bid to win votes. The probe follows would-be Ukip MP Kim Rose, who is standing in Southampton Itchen, being grilled by police for giving out sausage rolls at a party event earlier this year. Detectives are expected to speak to Mr Norman after he was photographed with trays of baked goods on April 2. He described the allegations as ‘nonsense’, saying: ‘We had a couple of small boxes of chocolate muffins ... we may have given out one or two to children, who are not even voters.’ There have been two sales to big pension funds and City institutions in 2013 and early in 2014. Late last year, UK Financial Investments, the Treasury body that manages the Government stake, hired investment bank Morgan Stanley to sell a few million Lloyds shares in the market every day over a six month period – a practice known as a ‘dribble-out’. The Government still owns £12.5 billion of Lloyds shares and experts expect £4 billion worth to be offered to the public, with the rest sold to City institutions. With the share price currently above 78p, the Tories will be able claim they have banked a profit running into billions for the taxpayer. However, while Lloyds has been a success story, the Government’s other big bank investment – Royal Bank of Scotland – has not. The Treasury under Mr Brown paid an average of 502p a share for RBS when it was rescued. They were changing hands on Friday for 349p. In Mr Cameron’s announcement today, he is expected to say: ‘The £20 billion bailout of Lloyds Bank by the last Labour government became a symbol of the crisis that engulfed the British economy under Labour. After the public bailed it out, people feared they wouldn’t see their money returned. Today they are. ‘Today’s announcement marks another step in the long journey we have been making repairing our banks, turning our economy around and reducing our national debt, only made possible by our long-term economic plan. ‘That’s why it is so important that we don’t put all that progress at risk, but instead build on what we’ve done so we can deliver a brighter, more secure future for our country.’ COUNTRY LIFE: A 'beater' at work and below,  a bottle of Sipsmith Dry Gin . The Prime Minister indulged his love of country sports by taking part in a secret country shoot near his Oxfordshire constituency home. And he celebrated with a nip of a specially prepared ‘Chipping Norton’ cocktail. But witnesses say that David Cameron did not himself use a gun – despite his reputation as a skilled marksman. Instead, he acted as a ‘beater’ to flush out the game. The event took place on New Year’s Eve but until now has been kept a closely guarded secret. It took place near Chipping Norton, the Oxfordshire town which has given its name to the ‘Chipping Norton set’ of high-profile local residents from the world of politics, media and showbusiness such as Mr Cameron and Jeremy Clarkson. Last night, the man who served Mr Cameron the cocktail said other people on what he described as a ‘country walk’ had no idea there would be a VIP guest. Jared Brown, master distiller at the West London ‘artisanal’ gin company Sipsmith, said: ‘No one but the landowner knew the Prime Minister would be joining us.’ He fought shy of describing the event as a shoot, but added: ‘I can say with utter certainty that Mr Cameron did not handle a gun.’ Mr Brown confirmed, though, that the PM did sample the cocktail, based on Sipsmith London Dry Gin. Last night, the drink, also containing manuka honey, raspberry tea and extract of echinacea, was being dubbed the ‘Chipping Norton cocktail’.","David Cameron will pledge to sell Lloyds shares if he wins the election .

"The son of a Syrian imam who was shot dead on a London street may have met his father’s killer just days before the murder. Sources close to the investigation, which is being led by the counter-terrorism unit, told the Sunday Times that Abdul Hadi Arwani, an opponent of Syrian President Bahsar Al-Assad, had visited the area where he was killed with his son days before his death. Arwani, 48, was shot and killed in his car on a quiet street in North West London after being called there last Tuesday, apparently to provide a quote for building work. Scroll down for video . imam, Abdul Hadi Arwani (pictured), was called to a job in the area he was killed days before his death . When the imam, who had links to the Muslim Brotherhood in the UK and abroad, arrived to the house with his son and not on his own, the supposed potential client asked Arwani to come back another day. The man was identified as black and speaking with an African accent. He pretended to have lost his keys which is why he asked Arwani, a part-time builder, to return later. The Sunday Telegraph reported that the man, who has not been otherwise been identified, also told the imam that there was no need for his son to accompany him again when he did come back. Arwani's children are in little doubt their father was killed by the man asking for the building quote. Scotland Yard is looking into whether the man was a hired killer who postponed the hit because because Arwani was not alone. The counter-terrorism unit has special expertise relating to politically motivated assassinations but they are also keeping other lines of inquiry open. Aspects of Arwani’s personal life as well as his financial standing are being considered. The Syrian-born activist and imam died of multiple gunshot wounds to the chest sustained near to the junction of the Paddocks and Greenhill, Wembley. His car was parked on what has been described as a blind bend, just out of sight of CCTV. Home: Mr Arwani, originally from Syria, lived in this home in White City, west London . Arwani’s VW Passat was parked neatly on the side of the road with its engine still running and one window wound down when his body was found . Neighbours, nearby at the time of the murder, have said they did not hear any shots fired, indicating, perhaps, that the killer used a silencer. Arwani’s VW Passat was parked neatly on the side of the road with its engine still running and one window wound down when his body was found. The Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist political group to which Arwani had long-standing links, is outlawed in many Middle Eastern countries. One Syrian opposition activist has said despite Arwami’s standing and his participation in protests against the Assad regime in London in 2012 (pictured) the imam was an unlikely target for assassination . One of the imam’s friends was quoted as saying that Arwani left the group in an official capacity ‘seven or eight years ago’ but had kept ties with some of the group’s senior figures. One Muslim Brotherhood leader, Ali Sadraddine Al-Bayanouni attended a gathering in remembrance of Arwani in the capital last week. Described as ‘non-violent Islamist’ by his family Arwani had links to a number of controversial preachers. Among them was Abu Qatada, deported to Jordan and dubbed Osama Bin Laden’s man in Europe. Arwani also campaigned against the extradition of the hook-welding preacher Abu Hamzr for offences related to terrorism. Despite the connections there is nothing to suggest Arwani was anything more than a peaceful moderate. Leaving Syria in 1982 during the last, failed uprising against the Assad regime, Arwami moved to Britain in the mid 1990s. He studied Islamic Sharia in Jordan where he claimed to have been sentenced to death in his absence by Syrian authorities. One Syrian opposition activist has said despite Arwani’s standing and his participation in protests against the Assad regime in London in 2012 the imam was an unlikely target for assassination. Imam: Mr Arwani was a preacher at the An-Noor Mosque (pictured) in Acton, West London, which has a reputation for hosting fundamentalist speakers . Hassan Anywabwile (pictured) from Trinidad and Tobago was brought in to replace Arwani at the An-Noor Mosque . Bassam Tablieh, a solicitor and opponent of the Syrian government, said there were many more obvious, high priority targets for Syrian authorities to go after in London. Police are also looking into a row over finances and transparency which led to Arwani being ousted from the An-Noor mosque in Acton where he was imam up until 2011. He was replaced at his mosque by a Caribbean preacher involved in an attempted coup d'état 25 years ago. Hassan Anywabwile from Trinidad and Tobago was brought in to replace Arwani at the An-Noor Mosque. Anywabwile's name appears in the Caribbean nation's parliamentary documents surrounding a violent coup attempt in 1990 by Muslim group Jamaat al Muslimeen It is understood that Arwani wanted to register the mosque as a charity with trustees, moving it away from its current status whereby the Acton mosque operates as a company. While the building for the mosque was bought for £1 million, raised in contributions from a number of members of the community, land registry records state the sole owner to be Khalid Rashad, one of the mosque’s founders, through a firm called ‘Brickridge’. The murdered imam had reportedly begun legal proceedings in the high court over the dispute. Rashad, 61, a Muslim convert from Wembley refused to comment on the row or Arwani’s decision to leave the mosque. He referred to a statement that expressed ‘great sadness’ at the imam’s death. It has not been suggested that any members of the mosque were involved in the murder.","Imam Abdul Hadi Arwani called to a building job in the area he was killed .

"John Carver knows only too well that a Tyne-Wear derby can make or break a manager. His first in the dugout was as assistant to Ruud Gullit in August, 1999, when on a sodden night at St James' Park the Dutchman left out Alan Shearer and Duncan Ferguson and paid for his selection with his job after a 2-1 defeat. Carver is now fighting to win the head coach position beyond the end of this season and knows what impact a victory – or a loss – could have on Sunday afternoon. John Carver is relishing the chance to take charge of his hometown club against Sunderland on Sunday . Gullit controversially decided not to start star players Duncan Ferguson and Alan Shearer in 1999 . Carver was assistant to former Newcastle manager Ruud Gullit who managed the club between 1998 and 1999 . His memories of Gullit's downfall remind him of such consequences. 'We were at the old training ground at Durham Cricket Club and I was in the room with Steve Clarke and Ruud,' recalls Carver. 'All of a sudden, he started talking about what the team was going to be against Sunderland. I said, 'Sorry Ruud, what did you say there?'. 'He said he was going to leave out Alan and Duncan. I said, 'Do you know how important this game is?'. 'He said, 'I have played in some massive derbies. I've played in them in Holland and London and I played in the Milan derby too'.

"(CNN)If you're famous and performing the American national anthem, be prepared to become a national hero or a national disgrace. Facts are facts.  Just ask Vince, Whitney, Roseanne, Jimi and Michael. Mötley Crüe's Vince Neil reminded us again this week of the dangers of tackling ""The Star-Spangled Banner."" Sure, he can shred it on ""Girls, Girls, Girls"" and ""Dr. Feelgood,"" but this is a different story -- a completely different story. To say Neil butchered the song before the Las Vegas Outlaws Arena Football League game would be unkind to those in the profession.  There's less carnage when butchers are done with their work. The late Whitney Houston set the modern standard for the national anthem at Super Bowl XXV.  In the early stages of the Gulf War in 1991, a patriotic America saluted her performance. Just six months earlier, comedian Roseanne Barr may have established the low-water mark. The crowd at the San Diego Padres game booed her rendition and President George H. W. Bush called it ""disgraceful."" There's nothing quite like getting the presidential thumbs down. One of the most controversial and beloved versions of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" comes from 1969. Guitar slinger Jimi Hendrix inflamed mainstream America with his psychedelic take on the national anthem to the delight of the Woodstock generation. And then there's Michael Bolton's version.  Overly wrought songs are his specialty and he doesn't disappoint in that department when he sings at the American League Championship Series in 2003.  Bolton belts it out, but there's one little problem -- the words.  Can anyone say crib notes?","Singing the national anthem is a risky proposition .
Whitney Houston nailed it; Roseanne Barr destroyed it .",eeafdc8b2d8130cabda5aafe352eab1198d0b9f8

"At least one is dead after a powerful storm capsized several sailboats participating in a regatta, and crews searched late on Saturday for at least four people missing in the waters, the Coast Guard said. The storm rolled through the area about 4 p.m. and a man was plucked from the waters by the Coast Guard around 9 p.m., Petty officer Carlos Vega said. He said crews would search through the night. 'We knew we were totally lost at sea,' said regatta participant Rhonda Morgan Gilreath, right, shown with her boyfriend Randy Rutledge of Rome Georgia on Saturday . Dauphin Island Regatta sailors gather near their docked sailboats on Saturday, April 25, 2015, in Dauphin Island, Alabama where Coast Guard officials said they responded to a report of multiple capsized vessels . More than 100 sailboats and as many as 200 people were participating in the Dauphin Island regatta in Mobile Bay. Dauphin Island Mayor Jeff Collier told Al.com  that at least one person was confirmed dead, but he did not know the cause. 'It's been a very tragic day,' Michael Smith, with the Buccaneer yacht club, told WSFA-TV. 'We've had a lot of breakage, missing people, fatalities.' Susan Kangal, who was on a boat, told WSFA it was the worst storm that she has seen. 'We were probably an inch from capsizing; everybody was ready to jump. I didn't have a life jacket on,' she said. The boats were part of the 57th iteration of the race. Scattered boats: 'They were scattered anywhere from Dauphin Island Bridge all the way out into Mobile Bay and across to Fort Morgan. It was a wide area,' said Dauphin Island Mayor Jeff Collier . Feeling blessed: Well-wishers congratulate regatta participant Robert Luiten of Mobile, Alabama, in blue shirt, on word that his son, Leonard Luiten, was found several hours after their boat capsized in a storm on Saturday .

He said that they expected thunderstorms but not as severe as they were. 'But we were not prepared for a gale,' Mather said, 'which is almost like a 30-minute hurricane.' Mather wasn't in the race and was able to pull three people onto his vessel about two miles north of the Dauphin Island Bridge. He said the boaters seemed extremely tired but none of them were injured. 'They were exhausted but they were fine,' he said.

"Beaten FA Cup semi-finalists Reading lost again as they were defeated by Birmingham in a scrappy Sky Bet Championship game at the Madejski Stadium on Wednesday night. Although Reading dominated most of the match, they wasted several chances in the closing stages of the first half. Birmingham held firm and grabbed the winner seven minutes from the end, when Clayton Donaldson nodded in his 16th goal of the season. Clayton Donaldson (left) scored a late headed winner for Birmingham City as his side defeated Reading 1-0 . Donaldson, who signed from Brentford in the summer, scored his 16th goal of the season . READING: Federici, Gunter, Cooper, Hector, Ake, McCleary (Appiah 63), Karacan, Chalobah, Obita, Mackie (Stacey 63), Blackman (Novakovich 81) Subs not used: Kelly, Norwood, Akpan, Andersen .

Referee: Lee Mason . Attendance: 14,604 . Reading were involved in a dramatic 2-1 defeat against Arsenal, after extra-time, in the last four of the Cup at Wembley on Saturday. Goalkeeper Adam Federici, whose fumble led to Alexis Sanchez's winning goal, was retained against Birmingham - as were six of his fellow starters from Wembley. At least Reading had no pressure on them, the last lingering doubts of relegation having been removed when Millwall lost 2-0 at Blackburn Rovers on Tuesday night. Birmingham had little to play for either, apart from trying to improve on a poor recent record of just two wins in eight league matches. A predictably dour opening, with neither side keen to force the pace, ended when Wes Thomas aimed at Federici. But it was a weak effort that did not trouble the Australian goalkeeper. Reading, with only two wins in 13 league games behind them and no wins in six, responded swiftly as the game warmed up. Garath McCleary, scorer of Reading's equaliser against Arsenal, fired wide after a long pass from Jake Cooper. A Cooper header lacked the power to test Birmingham keeper Darren Randolph, Jamie Mackie shot wide after Jem Karacan had been blocked out, and Mackie and Nick Blackman had close-range efforts cleared to safety. Randolph made a flying save to keep out a fierce McCleary shot and the keeper also had to stop two decent long-range attempts from Nathaniel Chalobah. Reading fans showed their support for Adam Federci following his blunder at Wembley on Saturday . Donaldson goes one-on-one with Federici, who was hoping to make amends for his mistake against Arsenal . Birmingham threatened only rarely, Paul Caddis blazing over from a Diego Fabbrini cross, which Donaldson had missed, and Jonathan Grounds heading straight at Federici from a Caddis corner. Reading kept up the momentum after the interval but, as Birmingham defended stubbornly, the home side spoiled good approach work with poor final touches. Nathan Ake did manage to fashion a chance when wriggling clear of his markers but drove straight at Randolph. Reading lost their second game in as many matches as their poor Championship form continues . Birmingham continued to sit back, inviting the pressure. Jordan Obita missed with a powerful drive and then drilled over a low cross that no team-mate was able to reach. Andrew Shinnie was off target from distance but Reading regained the upper hand with efforts from Chalobah, a 20-yard shot saved by Randolph, substitute Jack Stacey and Ake. Birmingham rallied late on, with Federici having to make two smart saves to deny substitute Demarai Gray. And the visitors broke the deadlock in the 83rd minute. Stephen Gleeson delivered a corner from the left and Donaldson rose unchallenged to glance a header past the helpless Federici.","Reading are 18th in the Championship while Birmingham City sit in 15th .

"In a matter of moments, Samantha Rawcliffe was catapulted towards an uncertain future. Without warning, the mother-of-two lost all control of her body while she was behind the wheel of her car. Gripped by what would later be diagnosed as a rare brain disorder, the 40-year-old crashed. She blamed her uncontrollable shaking in the aftermath of the accident on her shock. But over the following days, when she lost control of her bladder repeatedly, she feared something else was to blame. Tests revealed she was suffering functional neurological disorder - an umbrella term for a wide variety of neurological symptoms that doctors cannot explain. Samantha Rawcliffe, 40, from Morecambe, has been diagnosed with the rare condition functional neurological disorder - an umbrella term to cover a range of neurological symptoms . The mother-of-two suddenly lost all control of her body and crashed her car last May. In the days after the accident she lost control of her bladder and was shaking uncontrollably . 'It wasn't a bad accident, but I went home shaken and had a drink,' she said. 'I just couldn't stop shaking. 'The next day I wet myself and I wet the bed for the next three nights. 'But I didn't know what was wrong with me, and thought I had a trapped nerve or something like that. 'Even a year on, I have no feeling in my bladder, and I don't know when I need the toilet or even when I am actually weeing. 'There is no sign that will ever return. 'When I was told I had FND, I didn't even know what  it was and it just isn't out there, it's so rare.' Following her accident on May 26, last year, Mrs Rawcliffe was taken to the Royal Preston Hospital to meet neurologists. They eventually diagnosed the rare illness functional neurological disorder in September, following a series of tests. Last September doctors diagnosed the rare brain disorder. Mrs Rawcliffe is now confined to her house, unable to walk and relies on a mobility scooter. Each day she has to take a cocktail of 32 different drugs . Mrs Rawcliffe, from Morecambe, has since had to give up her job as a teaching assistant, and can no longer drive. She struggles to walk further than eight metres, and relies on a mobility scooter to get around. Functional neurological disorder is an umbrella term that covers a variety of symptoms that cannot be explained. The condition can be as debilitating as Parkinson's disease and MS, and may share many common symptoms. Very few effective treatment plans exist. Physical therapy is often the most effective form of treatment, with the aim of reintroducing proper movement and motor control. Many patients are also prescribed cognitive behaviour therapy. The condition can cause the following symptoms: . Source: FND Hope . The 40-year-old spends most of her time confined to her home, and has to take 32 tablets each day to prevent choking fits and tremors. 'Life is quite boring and I can't do anything myself whether it's washing, showering, cooking cleaning,' she said. 'Before I was diagnosed I was going to the gym five times a week and I loved my job. I'm 40 - I never wanted to retire. 'In fact, I get quite tearful when I think about it and my old colleagues always say there is a hole where Sam should be at work. 'I've got no independence anymore and I sold my car in the end because I was sick of looking at it.' Doctors cannot determine whether the condition had been lying dormant in Mrs Rawcliffe's body before it revealed itself. She suffered a mini-stroke as a teenager but recovered within three weeks and met her husband Phillip a few months later. Despite back pain from another car accident 12 years ago, the mother-of-two has not suffered any other ailments. Power plant technician Phillip, 47, and the couple's children Rhys, 19 and Rebecca, 17, have rallied to help. 'I think the kids took it hard at first - there was a lot of crying,' Mrs Rawcliffe said. 'But I have a big family and support network and they have all adapted so brilliantly. 'I used to be the life and soul of the party and I've never been a miserable person but there is so much that I can't do and it's hard to take. 'I end up kind of mourning for the life that I had had before this.' Mrs Rawcliffe is hoping to raise awareness of the condition by drumming up funds for the organisation FND Hope to help boost support for sufferers.

"Police in Houston say a 34-year-old man got behind the wheel of his car while under the influence Sunday, leaving a path of destruction in his wake and killing two people, one of them a 6-year-old boy. Blaine Boudreaux has been charged with intoxication manslaughter, intoxicated assault and failure to stop and render aid involving death in connection to at least three separate DUI collisions that took place within three hours in Houston. Boudreaux, who also has an extensive DUI record in his native Louisiana, was allegedly drunk when he ran a red light on Lockwood Drive at around 6.3opm and slammed his Dodge pickup truck into a Honda Civic. Path of destruction: Blaine Boudreaux (left), 34, has been charged in connection to three separate DUI crashes in Houston that killed 6-year-old Josh Medrano, injured his mother and led to the death of a homeless man . Heartbroken: The family of 6-year-old Joshua Medrano are seen Wednesday leaving the courtroom where Blaine Boudreaux made an appearance on charges stemming from a trio of accidents in Houston. On of the boy's relatives screamed at the suspect: 'I hope you die!' Joshua Medrano, 6, who was a passenger in the sedan, was fatally injured. His mother, Cynthia, was hospitalized with a punctured lung and broken bones. Boudreaux was arrested at the scene after failing a field sobriety test. Three wrecks: The 34-year-old, who has a history of DUIs in Louisiana, is also accused of crashing into another car carrying a woman and a toddler . Several hours earlier, according to police, the 34-year-old man struck and killed 61-year-old vagrant Leonard Batiste walking along Texas 5 Spur near the University of Houston. Investigators say the homeless man was mowed down at around 5.15pm Sunday but his body was not discovered until Monday afternoon. Boudreaux’s entire bumper, complete with his license plate, was found nearby. Blaine Boudreaux also has been linked to a third collision that occurred about two hours before Batiste's death. The two-car crash took place in the 6600 block of Fannin Street and involved a mother and her 2-year-old child, who were taken to a hospital and later released. In that case, Boudreaux was issued a ticket by a police officer and allowed to leave the scene. After slamming into the elderly man on Texas 5 Spur, Boudreaux allegedly dozed off behind the wheel and didn't wake up until another driver honked at him to get his attention. That is when he ran the red light at the intersection of Lockwood and the East Freeway and slammed into Cynthia Medrano's black Honda, killing her son, according to officials. Joseph Rodriguez, the boy's stepfather, said little Joshua wanted to become a firefighter when he grew up. Rodriguez said the officer who stopped Boudreaux after the first accident involving the mother and toddler should have detained him instead of letting the man go. Prosecutor Alison Baimbridge told the Houston Chronicle investigators are now looking into that collision and resulting citation in light of Boudreaux's apparent intoxication about two hours. Cynthia Medrano, pictured here with her family, was driving Sunday evening with her young son in the passenger seat when police say Boudreaux ran a red light and plowed into her Honda Civic . Doomed: Even though the 6-year-old was buckled in, he suffered fatal injuries and died upon arriving at a hospital . When questioned by police after his arrest, Boudreaux allegedly admitted that he had taken anti-depressants and a drug used to treat addiction to opiates before getting behind the wheel of his pickup truck Sunday afternoon. Blaine Boudreaux, a Catholic school dropout who moved to Houston in his late teens, has recently lost his home security business and allowed his pharmacy technician license to lapse, reported the Chronicle. During his arraignment Wednesday morning, prosecutors revealed that the suspect has multiple outstanding warrants for DUIs in Louisiana. In one case, he also had jumped bail. In light of these facts, his bond was set at $100,000 on each of the three counts, reported the station KTRK. Boudreaux’s arraignment was attended by several members of Joshua Medrano's family who sobbed in court and showed Boudreaux the middle finger. One woman cried out 'I hope you die!' as the suspect clad in an orange jumpsuit was being led out of the courtroom.

Cole was executed by lethal injection at 10.15pm on Tuesday at the Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center in Bonne Terre, Missouri and was pronounced dead at 10.24pm, a spokesman for the Missouri Department of Corrections wrote in a statement to Daily Mail Online. Scroll down for video . Andre Cole, 52, became the third convicted killer put to death this year in Missouri . He declined to order a last meal and received the day's inmate tray meal of a turkey and bologna sandwich, a cookie and fruit punch. He did not provide a final written statement, the spokesman said. Department of Corrections Director George A. Lombardi read the following statement from Gov. Jay Nixon: 'Next week marks the observance of Crime Victims’ Rights Week in Missouri, and tonight I ask the people of our state to especially remember Anthony Curtis, murdered by the man whose sentence was carried out tonight. 'Far too often, the names of those who are victims of violent crime, such as Anthony Curtis, are the names that are forgotten. 'Please join us in keeping Anthony Curtis and his loved ones in your thoughts and prayers.' On Tuesday, Gov. Nixon refused a clemency petition that raised concerns about the fact that Cole, who was black, was convicted and sentenced by an all-white jury. Cole and his wife, Terri, were married for 11 years and had two children before divorcing in 1995. The couple fought about visitation and he was upset about child support payments, authorities said. By 1998, Cole was $3,000 behind in child support. Attorney General Chris Koster said Cole became angry when he learned that a payroll withholding order was issued to his employer, taking the money out of his check. 'Before I give her another dime, I'll kill (her),' Cole told co-workers, according to Koster. The first deduction appeared on his August 21, 1998, paycheck. Hours later, Cole forced his way into his ex-wife's home by throwing a tire jack through a glass door, Koster said. He was confronted by Curtis, a friend who was visiting. Andre Cole used a kitchen knife to repeatedly stab Curtis, then Terri Cole. Curtis died but Terri Cole survived. Cole fled the state but surrendered 33 days later. He claimed at trial that he did not bring a weapon into Terri Cole's house and that Curtis initiated the attack with a knife. Andre Cole's brother, DeAngelo Cole, 38, of Las Vegas, said the attack was out of character for his sibling. He called it a crime of passion. 'It was a one-time thing,' DeAngelo Cole said. 'He didn't have a history of that kind of behavior.' Cole's attorney, Joseph Luby, said Cole's mental health deteriorated during the more than a decade he spent in prison. He said Cole was plagued by psychosis and constantly heard voices in his head. Cole was executed by lethal injection at 10.15pm on Tuesday at the Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center (above) in Bonne Terre, Missouri . The courts were not convinced. Both the Missouri Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to halt the execution based on mental health concerns. The U.S. Supreme Court also turned away appeals based on Missouri's secretive method of obtaining the execution drug pentobarbital and over how instructions were given to the jury. The jury itself was the source of the clemency request to Nixon. Advocates for Cole, including the NAACP, the American Civil Liberties Union and others, said his case was among many in which St. Louis County prosecutors unfairly prohibited black jurors from hearing a death penalty case involving a black suspect. All 12 jurors in Cole's case were white. Kimber Edwards, who was scheduled for execution in May, was also convicted and sentenced by an all-white jury. The Missouri Supreme Court, without explanation, canceled the execution orders for Edwards earlier this month. Missouri tied Texas for the most executions in 2014 with 10. Missouri has now executed 15 men since November 2013.","Andre Cole, 52, became the third convicted killer put to death this year in Missouri and was executed by lethal injection on Tuesday .

"A woman who died suddenly was eaten by her pet dogs after her body lay undiscovered for days, an inquest was told. Noelle Baynham was found by a close friend who let himself in after she failed to answer the door. The body had been partially eaten by the Jack Russell and Staffordshire Bull Terrier, which are initially thought to have tried to wake her before becoming desperate for food. It is believed the 61-year-old from Winchester, Hampshire, collapsed and died following an accidental overdose of medication. Eaten: Noelle Baynham's dogs started to eat her remains after being locked in the house for days. The most likely cause of death was an accidental overdose, an inquest was told . However a pathologist could not determine the exact cause of death because the dogs, who were trapped in the house, ate parts of her vital organs. Concerned friend Grant Donovan made the 'horrific' discovery of her remains after nobody answered the front door at her home. He told the inquest that he could hear her two dogs barking and jumping behind the door and became concerned that there did not appear to be anyone in with them. Finding the back door unlocked, he entered the house where he said the floors were covered in dog faeces. Walking through, he then discovered Ms Baynham's body lying on the landing. 'This was the most horrifying thing I have ever seen,' he told the inquest. 'I could not look at her long, so I just came away and called 999.' Detectives who searched the house following the grim discovery, on January 17 this year, could find no evidence of a struggle or foul play. The hearing was told how former jeweller Ms Baynham was found was in her dressing gown and had run a bath just before her death. Pets: A Staffordshire Bull Terrier (left) and Jack Russell (right) like the ones owned by Noelle Baynham . Detective Constable Wesley Arnold from Hampshire Police told the coroner that scratch marks on her chest indicated that her dogs may have tried to wake her after she collapsed. Home Office pathologist Dr Amanda Jeffery reaveled that she had probably died 'a few days' before she was found, but because the dogs had eaten her organs it was impossible to establish exactly what had killed her. The 'combined effect' of a variety of drugs found in her system was likely to have been the cause of an accidental overdose, she added. The hearing was told that Ms Baynham suffered from bipolar disorder and chronic alcoholism and was prescribed a variety of medication. Blood tests found a range of drugs in her system including potentially toxic levels of painkillers. Recording an open verdict, senior central Hampshire coroner Grahame Short ruled that there was no evidence of suicide or an accidental fall, but said Ms Baynham may have had a stroke. 'The horrific element in this case is what happened after death rather than before, and it's entirely plausible that when there are dogs in the house with no one to care for them, that they will then start to eat her remains. 'That clearly was a major hindrance to Dr Jeffery in her examination, and as she's explained, she was not able to look at her important organs and she could not establish a clear cause of death. 'I have to say there's no sign to say this was a deliberate overdose. There can come a point where [the drug level over time is] just too high and one pill too many can tip over the balance.' The dogs were subsequently put down on the advice of police officers.","Jack Russell and Staffordshire Bull Terrier were trapped in house .

"A predatory convicted paedophile with an obsession with young girls has gone on the run after vanishing from a psychiatric unit. Stephen Munden, 54, described as having a 'fanatical obsession' with small girls after he targeted a toddler on a bus, has been missing since 6.15pm on Tuesday and was last seen leaving a hospital, near Hook, Hampshire. Now officers have launched a manhunt to find Munden  - who was detained under the Mental Health Act after sexually touching the three-year-old girl. A predatory convicted paedophile with an obsession with young girls has gone on the run after vanishing from a psychiatric unit. Stephen Munden, 54, (pictured with and without a beard) was last seen leaving a hospital, near Hook, Hampshire . He is described as about 5ft 8ins tall, of a heavy build, and has dark hair. Officers said they believed that Munden, who suffers from learning difficulties, may have shaved off his beard before leaving the hospital in Winchfield and have released images of him with both facial hair and a clean shave. He was detained at the private facility under a hospital order following his sentence last August for sexual offences. Munden was convicted of sexually touching a child under the age of 13. A court heard he deliberately sat near a three-year-old girl and stroked her hand with his finger - in full view of the child's mother and grandmother. Munden, formerly of Marchwood, near Southampton, denied the offence, claiming it was accidental when he appeared at Southampton Crown Court. During the sentencing David Jenkins, prosecuting, told Judge Peter Henry that the defendant had admitted ten unrelated offences of possessing or attempting to possess indecent images of children. The court heard he had been arrested after using one of the public computers at Hythe library in an attempt to download images. Mr Jenkins said children's clothes, books and dolls were found at Munden's home and added: 'He has a fanatical obsession with young girls.' A court heard he deliberately sat near a three-year-old girl and stroked her hand with his finger - in full view of the child's mother and grandmother. Munden, formerly of Marchwood, near Southampton, denied the offence, claiming it was accidental when he appeared at Southampton Crown Court . Consultant physiatrist John O'Shea said the defendant was autistic and also suffered from mild learning difficulties. He added that Munden had difficulty controlling his sexual interest in small children but the girl on the bus was probably unaware of his intentions. Keely Harvey, in mitigation, said: 'He did not accept that he deliberately touched the child's hand.' But the judge said 'the move from non-contact offences to a contact offence is significant' and he was made the subject of a hospital order. Detective Chief Inspector Tim Rowlandson said: 'We are extremely keen to hear from anyone who has seen this man since yesterday evening or knows where he might be. 'Mr Munden is subject to a hospital order after being convicted and sentenced for sexual offences and also suffers from learning difficulties, so we need to know where he is as a matter of urgency.'","Stephen Munden, 54, has absconded from hospital, near Hook, Hampshire .

"A  photographer captured an intimidating site as he parachuted off the coast of south Florida last week. Photographer John Massung was flying over Sebastian Inlet on Thursday when he saw hundreds of sharks swarming just 100 feet from the beach. Massung says he flew for about a mile down the shore and that the hordes of sharks never ended. A fellow photographer was even further out and saw the same scene.

Most responded that the sharks looked like either Blacktips or Spinners, which migrate this time of year to breed. The picture had been shared more than 2,000 times by Sunday.

"It may have been Miley Cyrus' pink heart-shaped nipple pasties that garnered all the attention when she paid honour to rocker Joan Jett on Saturday, but eagle-eyed fans were distracted by something else.

Please shut up' Of course, loyal fans sprung to her defence. One, named Abi, tweeted: 'Stop telling @MileyCyrus to shave her armpits? She's a woman. She doesn't have to do what you say!

"Tens of millions of people in China marked the annual 'Tomb Sweeping Festival' this weekend by travelling home to their ancestral villages. Families across the country descended on graveyards to clean their tombs of the deceased and honour their loved ones, burning fake paper money and leaving their favourite food and drink to ensure they are not poor or hungry in the afterlife. As part of the Qingming Festival – which means 'pure brightness' – China celebrates the coming spring and the beauty of nature, says People’s Daily Online. A grand and colourful ceremony was held in honour of the 'Yellow Emperor' Huangdi in Huangling County, Shaanxi Province . Huangdi is considered the ancestor of the Qingming Festival which sees the Chinese mark the start of spring with outdoor celebrations . Lines of dancers take to the stage as part of the celebration, which was watched by thousands of people during the public holiday .

Traditional Chinese dancers wear intricate gowns as they swirl and dance in the sunshine during the celebrations in the city of Huangi . An actor dressed as a soldier takes a break from the celebration to check his phone . In Shaanxi Province, a huge outdoor celebration was held as part of the Qingming Festival and in honour of the 'Yellow Emperor' Huang Di, considered the founding father of the Chinese nation. A bell was rung from the top of the city's temple, while the drums were struck 34 times, one for each of China's provinces including Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. The festival falls in the first week of April every year, and is one of the 24 Chinese solar terms - the date from which temperatures rise, rainfall increases and marks an important time for the land to be prepared for the sowing of seeds. Hundreds of visitors filmed the celebrations on their smart phones, as a colourful inflatable dragon dances in the sky. It is said that the Yellow Emperor Huang Di did not die, but instead ascended into heaven on the back of a dragon - making the creature a Chinese symbol . Participants carry platters of fruit as part of the ceremony in the central China, which had hundreds of dancers and performers .

A young performer casts a smile on a guard, as she fixed her hair during the Qingming festival celebrations .

Opinion on the origins of the festival differ, but it can be traced back to the Tang Dynasty which ruled China between 618 and 907. While millions of Chinese people made the trip to their ancestral villages, opportunistic traders took advantage of some people's inability to make the visit - advertising 'tomb sweeping packages' which include weeping, praying and cleaning. Depending on the package, costing between 100 yuan and 1,300 yuan, the buyer receives a commemorative photo of the occasion. A record-breaking 36.5 million passenger trips were made over the weekend and public holiday - up 5.8 per cent on last year and an all-time high. The rise is partially due to the construction of new railways in recent years, particularly high-speed railway, say commentators. A couple pray as they burn paper money during Qingming.

"A Church of Scientology-backed organization is facing a bizarre land use battle over its plans to turn a patch of secluded in woods near the presidential retreat Camp David into a drug rehab center. Lawyers hired by drug rehab network Narcocon have argued that Trout Run, a property in Frederick County, Maryland, has historic significance because President Herbert Hoover once caught a fish at the site. Opponents view the proposed designation as a trick to circumvent current zoning laws for the 40-acre plot of land and create a drug rehabilitation program that some call dangerous. Narcocon, a Church of Scientology-affiliated drug rehab network, is trying to prove that a patch of land near Camp David is historic enough so that they can build a center for twelve patients . A Scientology-back real estate company bought Trout Run for $4.85million in 2013, and has been trying to change its land designation so that it can build a center that uses saunas and vitamin therapy for addicts . Narcocon, which uses sauna sessions and the teachings of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard, has been sued in the past for wrongful deaths. It has denied wrongdoing. The group's treatment program claims that megadoses of the vitamin Niacin and spending five hours a day in a sauna for a month eliminates addiction cravings that are stored in the body's fat cells. Treatments at the center can cost more than $30,000 per month and typically last for as long as six months. Narcocon officials, who run more than 120 centers around the world, deny that the program tries to convert addicts to Scientology, though the group prominently features a quote from Hubbard on its website. The organization says that is focused on a secular approach to helping people overcome addiction. Its Maryland center would house 12 patients, with eight staff living there and eight living off-site. However, the current zoning laws for Trout Run, which includes a collection of stone cottages, classify it for resource conservation and do not permit any medical purpose for the site, according to the Washington Post. Though Narcocon says that it is non-religious and does not try to convert people to Scientology, its website features the religion's founder L Ron Hubbard (pictured) prominently . Placing the property on the county register of historic places would allow Narconon to conduct its program. The rehabilitation program was founded in 1966 and is based on the teachings of Scientology's founder L. Ron Hubbard. Narconon claims it is a non-religious, non-profit, non-medical . rehabilitation program with patients around the world. Its methods include . spending up to five hours a day in a sauna for 30 days straight and mega . doses of the vitamin Niacin. The hypothesis underlying the program is . that drugs and their metabolites are stored in the body's fatty tissues . for years, causing the addict's cravings when partially released later . on. But these can be flushed out through a regimen comprising elements such as . exercise, sauna and intake of high doses of vitamins, according to the facility's methods. This hypothesis does not enjoy . mainstream acceptance, and researchers and practitioners tend . to discount Narconon due to its connection with Scientology. No independent study that has not been funded by the center exist to confirm the supposed efficacy of its treatment, which has repeatedly been cited as curing 75 per cent of addicts. Since its establishment, it has faced considerable controversy over the . safety and effectiveness of its rehabilitation methods and the . organization's links to the Church of Scientology. Fees can sometimes reach more than $30,000 per month and centers bring in millions of dollars a year from patients. An aide of Herbert Hoover bought the property in the late 1920s and the president went on fishing trips there,  the Frederick News Post reported. Narcocon hired a consultant whose history of Trout Run said that Hoover 'reeled in a fine one-and-one-half pound trout' during a visit. 'No President was born or died there. No epic battles were won or lost, no proclamations penned, no foreign dignitaries lodged and feted,' local drug counselor Kristin Milne-Glasser wrote in opposition to the historic designation. She said that the area merits a roadside plaque at most. President Dwight Eisenhower and other Washington elites also fished at Trout Run during his time in office. Frederick County's Historic Preservation Commission ruled that the site is eligible to be voted onto the register because of its early 20th century architecture. Social Betterment Properties International, a real estate company tied to Scientology, bought the land in 2013 for $4.85million from a government official who had long been trying to sell it. Narconon has been working on building its center since. County councilors delayed voting on the measure two weeks ago so they could have more time to review the proposal and plan to grant or deny approval on Tuesday. Beyond questions of history, opponents to the rehab center have cited safety concerns about the mysterious organization being so close to Camp David and Narcocon's alleged checkered past. Celebrity Scientologists such as John Travolta and Tom Cruise have repeated Narconon's message about how it saves 75 per cent of addicts. Trout Run was first built and developed by an aide of President Herbert Hoover (right) in the late 1920s. It is located in a woods several miles from presidential retreat Camp David (left during G8 Summit in 2012) Trout Run in Maryland was used for fishing by President Hoover (right) and President Dwight Eisenhower (left) during their times in office (file photo, Colorado, 1954) However, the organization previously lost its license  in Georgia after the death of  28-year-old former Marine Patrick Desmond, who was being treated for alcoholism but died after allegedly trying heroin for the first time while in treatment. Previous deaths at Narcocon include three young people who  died within a year at a flagship Oklahoma facility, according to NBC. Hilary Holten, 21, was found dead in her bed at the center in April 2012 of unknown causes. Stacy Murphy, 20, died of an oxymorphone overdose in July. Gabriel Graves, a 32-year-old father of two, died of unknown causes in October 2011. Narconon denied responsibility for any patient deaths. The group's Arrowhead in Oklahoma was estimated to have brought in $10.88million in revenue in 2011.

"Such has been the volatility at the top of the Championship this season that predicting future outcomes has proved a futile exercise, but what is certain is that Middlesbrough hold the aces. With just four weeks remaining, Aitor Karanka's team are top of a division that has witnessed the leadership change hands 15 times. Seven points separate eight teams with six matches to play but Boro know if they keep winning, they cannot be caught. Their buffer over second-placed Bournemouth is a point with Watford, their opponents on Monday, and Norwich a point further back. Patrick Bamford (left) of Middlesbrough celebrates his goal against Wigan with his team mates . Another advantage for the Teesside club is that their contest at Vicarage Road is a lunchtime kick-off. As they discovered on Good Friday, when they triumphed over relegation-threatened Wigan, stealing a march can have a psychological effect. Previous leaders Bournemouth and 10-man Watford could only draw, at Ipswich and Derby respectively, in the evening matches. 'It definitely puts pressure on other teams, like Watford and Bournemouth found on Friday night,' said Boro defender Ben Gibson. 'It gives us a few more hours to recover when the turnaround for games is short and sharp, as well. Monday will be the same, big style.' Watford's 18-goal striker Odion Ighalo intends to have a say in what happens next. Ighalo helped Granada reach La Liga in 2011 and admits he only signed for Watford to play in the English top flight. Odion Ighalo rescued a point for Watford with this equaliser against fellow promotion hopefuls Derby . Bournemouth have been this season's surprise package and led the Championship for 101 days . 'I came to Watford not because I want to play in the Championship but because I have the opportunity to be in the Premier League,' he said. 'Our fans have to scream from the start to the end. I know by God's grace we are going to win that game at home.' Such is the precarious nature of the promotion race, however, that the division could have a completely different top two on Monday evening if Watford and Norwich, who host mid-table Sheffield Wednesday, win and Bournemouth fail to secure three points against Birmingham. With the stakes so high it is perhaps understandable that Karanka is hoping Jonathan Woodgate, his experienced captain, can continue to play through the pain. He missed the recent defeat at Bournemouth due to his broken toe but returned against Wigan. Crucially, each of the defender's five appearances this season, and eight of his last nine, have resulted in wins. Alex Neil (left) has impressed since taking over at Norwich and the Canaries remain in contention at the top . Derby led the way earlier in the season but have now not won in seven games under Steve McClaren . Derby, meanwhile, have seemingly forgotten how to win. Seven games without victory has seen them slump to sixth but Steve McClaren insists he will not sacrifice his principles. McClaren, who takes his team to Wigan, said: 'I don't want to put 10 defenders on and kick the ball long and not play our football. We have a certain way of playing, a certain style, which has got us where we are.' The eighth side in the division are Wolves, who have the most potent striker in 28-goal Benik Afobe, signed from Arsenal for £2million in January. Afobe has made himself instantly at home and has Leeds in his sights today. Final word to the English forward: 'Every time we go into the changing room we see everyone else has won.'

"Aston Villa may be gearing up for an FA Cup semi-final clash against Liverpool on Sunday, but that didn't stop manager Tim Sherwood having some fun during a press conference on Friday. Sherwood showed his softer side during the week when he replied to a letter from six-year-old fan Charlie Pye who had applied for the Villa hotseat after Paul Lambert was sacked in February. The Villa youngster wanted a chocolate bar as a win bonus and would have agreed terms for a signed claret and blue football, a WWE wrestling figure and some sweets - and Sherwood had some fun on Friday as he revealed his 'win bonus' to the assembled media. Tim Sherwood was quizzed about his letter to young Aston Villa fan Charlie Pye on Friday . Sherwood revealed his 'win bonus' to the assembled media in reference to Pye's letter . 'He (Charlie) wrote to the club...he applied for the job when Paul left and I managed to just pip him to the post,' Sherwood joked. 'I wrote to him and just said no hard feelings...just unlucky, maybe next time for you. 'He said that he wanted his mum and dad to be the assistant managers and the win bonus would be sweets and chocolate.' Sherwood then reached down under the desk to reveal a Twix multi-pack. 'He sent me these this morning for my win bonus at Tottenham, so I thank you Charlie for that.'

"Documented and undocumented immigrant population in the United States could reach a record high of 51million in just eight years, according to U.S. Census figures. And by 2060, immigrants could account for 82 per cent of all population growth in the country. One in seven U.S. residents will be an immigrant by 2023, the report from the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) said. Documented and undocumented immigrants in the United States could reach a record high in the United States by 2023, when their share of the population could hit 14.8 per cent . That number could rise to one in five by 2060, when immigrant population reaches 78 million. This report comes as President Barack Obama is trying to use executive powers to expand Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) policies. Net immigration will steadily increase over the next 45 years, totaling at 64million . Without no change in current immigration policy, by 2023 the total immigrant population in the United states will reach 14.8 per cent, the highest ever recorded in American history . Immigration population will grow almost four times faster than native-born population and will reach 15.8 per cent of the nation's population by 2030, 17.1 per cent by 2040 and 18.8 per cent by 2060 . In 1990, immigrants accounted for just 7.9 per cent of U.S. population . U.S population could grow to 417million by 2016. In 2010 the population was 306million . Without a change to immigration policty, immigrants who arrive in the future and their descendants could account for three quarters of future U.S. population . Center for Immigration Studies . This could potentially exempt about five million undocumented immigrants from deportation. And with the surge in immigrant population, Republican presidential candidates have to figure out what their stance is on the subject as potential new policies could be established. CIS director of research Steven Camarota said that the growth in immigrant population has 'important implications for workers, schools, infrastructure, congestion and the environment'. 'They also may have implications for our ability to successfully assimilate and integrate immigrants,' he added. 'Yet there has been almost no national debate about bringing in so many people legally each year, which is the primary factor driving these numbers.' Currently there are approximately 12million undocumented immigrants in the United States and 70,000 more are expected to cross the border this year, according to the Washington Examiner. There are also more than 4.4million people on a U.S. State Department green card waiting list. And within years, Immigration population will grow almost four times faster than native-born population. From a starting point of 2010, immigration population will reach 15.8 per cent (57million) of the nation's population by 2030, 17.1 (65million) per cent by 2040 and 18.8 per cent (78million)  by 2060. Immigrants and their descendants will account for 75.5 per cent of the nation's population growth between 2010 and 2050 and 82 per cent of growth between 2010 and 2060. By 2060, immigrants and their descendants will account for 82 per cent of the nation's population growth since 2010 . President Barack Obama is trying to use executive powers to expand immigration policies, which could potentially exempt about 5million undocumented immigrants from deportation . Alabama Rep. Sen. Jeff Sessions, who has been a leader in the immigration debate, said in a letter to the New York Times on Saturday that an increase of immigrants in the country will hurt the middle class. He wrote: 'It defies reason to argue that the record admission of new foreign workers has no negative effect on the wages of American workers, including the wages of past immigrants hoping to climb into the middle class. 'Why would many of the largest business groups in the United States spend millions lobbying for the admission of more foreign workers if such policies did not cut labor costs?' Key business leaders form a group association with former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and members of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are meeting on Friday to discuss expanding immigration. The meeting it titled 'Understanding and Improving the High-Skilled H-1B Visa Program', according to the examiner.

"Despite the hype surrounding its first watch, the iPhone is still the engine behind Apple's phenomenal success, its latest figures have revealed. The results far surpassed most analysts' expectations for the first three months of the year, when sales traditionally fall from their holiday-season peak. Apple sold more than 61 million iPhones in the quarter, accounting for more than two-thirds of its $58 billion in revenue for the quarter and the lion's share of its $13.6 billion in profit - and up 40% from a year ago . Sales of iPhones in China were also revealed to have outstripped those in the US.

More than 61 million iPhones sole . iPad revenue fell 29% to $5.4 billion . Revenue from Mac computers rose 2%from a year earlier, to $5.6 billion . 'We are thrilled by the continued strength of iPhone, Mac and the App Store, which drove our best March quarter results ever,' said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO. 'We're seeing a higher rate of people switching to iPhone than we've experienced in previous cycles, and we're off to an exciting start to the June quarter with the launch of Apple Watch.' As expected, the numbers were down from the previous quarter, when holiday shoppers snapped up a record 74 million of Apple's new iPhone 6, 6 Plus and older models. But it was a 40 percent increase over the number of iPhones sold in the first three months of 2014. 'We're seeing great results all over the world,' Apple chief financial officer Luca Maestri told The Associated Press, adding that iPhone sales grew 72 percent in China, where the company has big hopes for expansion. Other products played a much smaller role. Revenue from Mac computers rose 2 percent from a year earlier, to $5.6 billion, while iPad revenue fell 29 percent, to $5.4 billion — continuing a steady decline in tablet sales. Apple didn't report any results for the new Apple Watch, which it began selling this month, after the quarter ended. Maestri said customer response had been 'positive.' Analysts estimate about 2 million have sold to date, suggesting early demand is healthy but not of blockbuster proportions. Apple shares have gained more than 50 percent over the last year, making it the world's most valuable company. 'It's been really great to see the reaction of customers,' said Cook. 'The response has been overwhelming. We can't wait to see more of the inspiring apps developers dream up.' The iPhone is another story. Since it began offering models with bigger screens last fall, Apple has vied with South Korea's Samsung for the No. 1 position in the global smartphone market. By some estimates, Apple outsold Samsung in the quarter that ended in December, and analysts will be watching closely when Samsung reports its latest results this week. Apple also announced an expansion of its effort to return more of its sizable cash war chest to investors. The company said it will raise its quarterly dividend by 11 percent, to 52 cents a share, and has increased a $90 billion stock buyback program to $140 billion. Apple didn't report any results for the new Apple Watch, which it began selling this month, after the quarter ended. In total, the company said the program will return $200 billion to investors by the end of March 2017. As iPhone sales have surged, so has Apple's stock. Apple shares have gained more than 50 percent over the last year, making it the world's most valuable company. The stock closed Monday at $132.65, up 1.8 percent for the day, and was rising in late trading. The iPhone isn't just Apple's 'dominant product,' said Frank Gillett, a tech industry analyst at Forrester Research. 'It's more than anything else what's driving the success of their company.' Market researchers, however, expect growth in the world smartphone market will slow this year, particularly at the higher price range where Apple competes, as most consumers in developed countries have already bought one. That could make it difficult for Apple to maintain its recent pace. 'They're extremely dependent on the iPhone,' said investment Colin Gillis at BGC Partners. 'At some point, the market dynamics change,' he said, adding that 'the question is what could replace the iPhone' if sales begin to slow. Customers looking at Apple iPhones in an Apple store in Shanghai, China, on January 14, 2014. Apple CEO Tim Cook has said he's optimistic about new markets such as China, where Apple has made a strong showing against Samsung and China's Xiaomi. And even if Apple is increasingly selling new iPhones to people who are simply upgrading older models, 'that's still a pretty healthy market,' said Gartner analyst Van Baker, noting that more than 700 million iPhones have been sold since the first model was introduced in 2007. Maestri also stressed the potential for new products like Apple Watch and Apple Pay, the company's mobile payment service. While these currently provide minimal revenue, analysts say they have big potential. And they are designed to work closely with the iPhone, which means each may bolster the other's popularity in the future, Gillett said.","Apple sold more than 61 million iPhones in the quarter .

"Just like humans learning to talk, puppies can sometimes take a while to learn to bark. At least, that seemed to be the case for one young Shibu Inu, who caused hilarity with a somewhat chatty display at an American Kennel Club centre. The pup was filmed squeaking and squawking after meeting a young husky dog and attempting to bark at its new companion. Captured on video, the puppies are held in the air by their respective handlers and one of the dogs makes a high-pitched whining sound. Opening its mouth, the Shibu Inu then begins vocalising with a yappy bark before the husky – leaning back in its handler’s arm – whines. People standing by laugh and put their hands to their mouths as a staff member turns to address and pacify the dog. The puppy Shibu Inu and husky feature opposite one another while conversing at an American Kennel Club centre . Falling quiet for a second, the Shibu Inu pipes up once more – louder than before – causing the husky to respond. As the dogs continue to converse, the video maker asks with a giggle: ‘What is that noise?’ But it is barely audible over the sounds of the intense barking, whining and yapping. Later in the video the excited Shibu Inu begins running in its owner's arms in its attempts to get closer to the husky. Passers-by laugh and film the two dogs as they begin yapping, whining and barking at one another . And people in the video can be seen laughing while mimicking the dog’s erratic and entirely humorous actions. The video concludes with the husky losing interest slightly and chewing on its handler’s sleeve. Before the same handler speaks to the Shibu Inu and gives it a rub, causing it to momentarily settle down. A staff member from the American Kennel Club centre attempts to pacify the puppy by giving it a rub . Canine vocalisation usually begins when a puppy is around two-to-three-weeks-old and generally consists of grunts and whines. At seven-to-eight-weeks-old, the vocalisation will develop into stronger sounding barks, although some dogs wait as long as 16 weeks before even making an attempt.","The Shibu Inu puppy has the impromptu chat with a husky .

"Nicola Sturgeon will today launch an extraordinary bid to ‘lead the UK’ as she unveils a string of policies apparently tailor-made for a power-sharing deal with Labour. The SNP leader will unveil a manifesto including proposals for British foreign policy, welfare payments, energy bills and English university tuition fees. Several of her election pledges overlap with Labour policy, including slashing tuition fees in England from a maximum of £9,000 a year to £6,000, and rolling back competition in the English NHS. Others are calculated to drag a minority Labour government to the left, including halting the roll-out of Iain Duncan Smith’s popular changes to benefits and cancelling the Trident nuclear weapons system. Scroll down for video . Control: The Tories warn SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon will be Ed Miliband's puppet master if he becomes Prime Minister after the election . Several election pledges in Miss Sturgeon's manifesto overlap with Labour policy, including slashing tuition fees in England from a maximum of £9,000 a year to £6,000, and rolling back competition in the English NHS . The SNP also wants the UK to formally recognise Palestine as a state, give energy regulator Ofgem the power to force suppliers to cut prices and to increase public spending on infrastructure in northern England and Wales. At the heart of the SNP’s manifesto are plans for what Miss Sturgeon has called ‘modest’ spending increases funded by yet more borrowing – but which in fact total £180billion over five years. Scotland’s First Minister, who is not herself running for a Westminster seat, said yesterday the SNP had much in common with Left-wing Labour MPs and aimed to build a ‘progressive alliance’ for people ‘right across the UK’. ‘There is an opportunity to build progressive alliances for progressive policies. It is a real rather than a pretend alternative to austerity,’ she told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. Today’s SNP election manifesto will be the first to be the focus of intense national scrutiny. Polls suggest the party is on course for a landslide victory north of the border, winning as many as 50 seats and holding the balance of power at Westminster. That could trigger constitutional turmoil of the sort that followed the 1910 election, when Irish Nationalists surged and ended up with more than 70 seats. In the years that followed, there was bitter conflict and the larger part of Ireland eventually seceded from the UK. The huge surge in support for the SNP could see senior Labour figures such as Jim Murphy (left) and Douglas Alexander (right) lose their seats . The latest Scotland-wide YouGov survey shows the SNP on a record 49 per cent, up three, with Labour trailing on 25 per cent, down four. The Conservatives were on 18 per cent and Liberal Democrats on just four per cent. The scale of the shift in traditional Labour strongholds in Scotland is unprecedented in modern European politics. Even senior Labour figures, including the Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy and the shadow foreign secretary and the party’s election campaign coordinator, Douglas Alexander, are facing defeat. The SNP will declare today that a ‘strong team’ of SNP MPs in Westminster would help ‘rebalance the UK - both politically and economically - from the chronic over-dominance of the City of London, which has harmed the overall UK economy and left regions of England neglected’. Miss Sturgeon insisted those who had asked Scotland to remain in the UK in last year’s independence referendum could not now object to it calling the shots at Westminster. ‘We were told by leaders of the No campaign during the closing stages of the referendum debate that Scotland’s voice really mattered. Indeed, we were told that Scotland shouldn’t leave the UK but lead the UK,’ she said. ‘So it is more than a bit rich, now that Scotland has decided to remain part of the Westminster system, for anyone in London or elsewhere to try and imply that Scotland’s voice shouldn’t be heard or that Scotland’s voice somehow becomes an illegitimate one if people here decide to elect a large number of SNP MPs.’ However, the First Minister will face tough questions at today’s launch over her plans for ‘full fiscal autonomy’ or effective ‘home rule’, which would see almost every power apart from foreign affairs and defence devolved to Holyrood. It would end the generous Barnett Formula that funds Scotland. The Institute for Fiscal Studies  has predicted that a ‘fiscally autonomous’ Scotland would have a £7.6billion black hole in its finances.","Nicola Sturgeon will today unveil SNP manifesto as a 'bid to lead the UK'

"Muslim women should be allowed to wear a full-face veil while appearing in court, Britain's most senior judge has suggested. Lord Neuberger, the President of the Supreme Court, said judges and courtrooms should allow women to wear the traditional dress as they should 'show, and be seen to show' respect towards different customs. He said judges should be 'sensitive' to the fact that they usually came from 'more privileged sector of society' than many of those facing them and they should have an understanding of the 'different cultural and social habits'. Lord Neuberger said Britain's privileged judges must be aware of their 'subconscious bias' when dealing with poorer members of society . His address to the Criminal Justice Alliance came at a time of uncertainty over the place of Muslim traditional dress in the legal system. Following a controversial trial in 2003 of a Muslim woman accused of witness intimidation, Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas said there was a need for clear guidance on the issue. Rebekah Dawson refused to give evidence after being told she had to remove her face veil to let the jury see her face while testifying. The 22-year-old was later sentenced to six months in prison at Blackfriars Crown Court after changing her plea. Rebekah Dawson refused to give evidence after being told she had to remove her face veil to let the jury see her face while testifying. Here she pictured during her court hearing . Last year, the European Court of Human Rights upheld a ban by France on wearing the Muslim full-face veil, the niqab. A case was brought by a 24-year-old French woman, who argued that the ban on wearing the veil in public violated her freedom of religion and expression. In Lord Neuberger's address, he said judges and lawyers often failed to recognise how 'artificial and intimidating' courts could be for ordinary people. He said: 'I sometimes wonder whether our trial procedures really are the best way of getting at the truth. 'Would you feel that you had given of your best if you had been forced to give evidence in unfamiliar surroundings, with lots of strangers watching, in an intimidating court, with lawyers in funny clothes asking questions, often aggressively and trying to catch you out, and with no ability to tell the story as you remember it?' Dawson was later sentenced to six months in prison at Blackfriars Crown Court (pictured) He said this did not mean a call for a major overhaul of court proceedings but said judges, lawyers and court staff must do as much as possible to help people feel at ease in court. He continued: 'Judges have to show, and have to be seen to show, respect to everybody equally, and that requires an understanding of different cultural and social habits. 'It is necessary to have some understanding as to how people from different cultural, social, religious or other backgrounds think and behave and how they expect others to behave. 'Well known examples include how some religions consider it inappropriate to take the oath, how some people consider it rude to look other people in the eye, how some women find it inappropriate to appear in public with their face uncovered, and how some people deem it inappropriate to confront others or to be confronted – for instance with an outright denial. Lord Neuberger also suggested Muslim women should be allowed to wear a full face veil while appearing in court . 'More broadly, judges should be courteous and, generally, good-humoured; and, while they should be firm, they should never, however great the temptation, lose their temper.' The judge made the comments a week ago during an address to the Criminal Justice Alliance, in which he spoke of modern aspects of the British legal system. In a lengthy speech entitled 'Fairness in the courts: the best we can do', Lord Neuberger also said judges and lawyers should always keep in mind how 'intimidating' the court process can be for those involved in trials, including 'the parties, their families, the victims, the witnesses and the jurors'. Speaking in the context of legal aid cuts, he said the importance of ensuring all parties involved in a case understand the goings-on in a court is now greater because 'people are having to choose between representing themselves or not getting justice at all'. He also said: 'Judges may not appear to be neutral because they will almost always be seen, normally rightly, to come from a more privileged sector of society, in both economic and educational terms, compared with many of the parties, witnesses, jurors in court. 'A white male public school judge presiding in a trial of an unemployed traveller from Eastern Europe accused of assaulting or robbing a white female public school woman will, I hope, always be unbiased. 'However, he should always think to himself what his subconscious may be thinking or how it may be causing him to act.' Keith Porteous Wood, Executive Director of the National Secular Society, told the Daily Telegraph: 'Lord Neuberger understandably recommends judges understand the expectations of how those 'from different cultural, social, religious or other backgrounds think and behave and how they expect others to behave' and that the judiciary should show 'respect to everybody equally'. 'It was a missed opportunity, however, not to acknowledge that occasionally – for example on a defendant wearing a full face veil – doing so might conflict with justice being seen to be done, or even justice being done. 'My concern is not theoretical; it is now 18 months since a judge at Blackfriars Magistrate Court wasted a great deal of court time dealing with the question of full-face veils, and made a heartfelt plea for central guidance to avoid this inefficient use of expensive court's resources being replicated elsewhere. 'The Lord Chief Justice's office has been dealing with this for a long time but seems disappointingly reluctant to issue any direction.'","Lord Neuberger said Muslim women should be allowed to wear a full-face veil when appearing in court to show respect to 'different customs .

"The Duke of Kent has been spotted leaving hospital with a walking stick after suffering a dislocated hip during an Easter trip to the Royal Family's Balmoral estate. The Queen's cousin, 79, injured himself while staying at the Queen's private residence in Royal Deeside, Aberdeenshire, on Saturday. He was taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary on Easter Monday and spent a night in hospital being treated for his injuries before being discharged today. Scroll down for video . The Duke of Kent, 79, was spotted leaving Aberdeen Royal Infirmary with a walking stick today (above). The Queen's cousin was admitted to the hospital yesterday after suffering a dislocated hip at the Balmoral estate . His Royal Highness Prince Edward walked to his daughter Lady Helen Taylor's car with a walking stick before being driven away. Buckingham Palace said today that he had been 'successfully' treated for a dislocated hip . Buckingham Palace confirmed His Royal Highness Prince Edward's injury and said: 'The Duke of Kent was admitted on Monday to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, where he was successfully treated for a dislocated hip. 'The Duke is expected to leave hospital later today.' The dislocation comes just two years after the Duke suffered a 'mild' stroke. In March 2013, he was taken to University College Hospital in London after suffering a the stroke, also known as a transient ischaemic attack. Despite his age, the Duke still undertakes a large number of royal engagements. He became the Duke of Kent at just six when his father died in a wartime flying accident in 1942. The Duke is the son of Prince George, the younger brother of King George VI and King Edward VIII. He enjoyed a lengthy military career and was a respected Army officer who also acted as Britain's international trade ambassador for 25 years. Nurses could be seen outside Aberdeen Royal Infirmary with the Duke and his daughter Lady Helen Taylor today. The Queen's cousin was driven away by his daughter after being discharged by doctors this afternoon . The Duke appeared downcast as he was driven away from the hospital by his daughter Lady Helen Taylor . He has since spent many years performing royal duties on behalf of the Queen and is perhaps now best known for being President of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club and presenting the Wimbledon trophies each summer. The royal is also the country's top Freemason - the secret society's Grand Master of the United Grand Lodge of England. His wife the Duchess of Kent has withdrawn from public life, dropping her HRH title. She now works as a music teacher, preferring to be known as 'Katharine Kent'. The couple have three children George, the Earl of St Andrews, Lady Helen Taylor, and Lord Nicholas Windsor. Balmoral Castle in Royal Deeside, Aberdeenshire, has been one of the residences for members of the British Royal Family since 1852. The original castle and estate was bought privately by Prince Albert. It is owned by the royal family, but it is not the property of the crown. The Duke is the son of Prince George, the younger brother of King George VI and King Edward VIII. It means he is the Queen's cousin (pictured together at Wimbledon in June 2010) and carries out duties on her behalf .

Going grey on the Jean Paul Gaultier catwalk in Paris on March 1 . Angela Le posted this image on Bored Panda which shows dark hair dyed a stunning shade of silver . 'For the grey hair trend, option one is to slowly reduce the amount of colour and gracefully allow the grey to appear (if you are going grey naturally) and option two is to add lighter ash highlights to enhance and complement the grey tones. 'A great haircut is key to going grey so you don't end up looking like you have given up on yourself!' Sibi also advises using a silver shampoo. 'It helps brighten the hair and remove yellow unflattering tones that grey hair has a tendency to do. 'Often grey hair is more dry therefore absorbs things like pollution cigarette smoke dulling down the silver fox making it look like tarnished brass.'

"These extraordinary pictures show more than 1,700 Chinese students taking an exam in their high school's playground - because they could not all fit inside. The freshmen students from Yichuan, Shaanxi province took the exam on Saturday in the first attempt by the school to allow pupils to sit exams in the open. The school said the reason behind the unusual move was the lack of sufficient indoor space - and added that it could be a test of the students' organizing capacity, the People's Daily Online reported. The paper reported that the Grade One students at Yichuan Senior High School suggested and organised the outdoor exam themselves. The students thought of everything and in order to avoid being dazzled by the sunshine, which may have caused them to feel dizzy, a regular radio announcement ordered pupils to turn their chairs and desks collectively from time to time. The newspaper reported that many of the students believe sitting the exam outside is a novel way to broaden their horizons and encourage them to feel more relaxed. Some of the students also suggested it could help to prevent cheating. 'Grade One students suggested they organise the exam in such a way,' said one unnamed teacher. 'We felt it was a great idea, the weather also allowed it, so we approved the proposal.'

"Ed Miliband will do 'more damage to the country than he did to his brother', Boris Johnson said this morning as the pair clashed on live TV. The London Mayor, who appeared alongside Mr Miliband on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, launched a furious personal assault on his rival - with their encounter descending into a furious shouting match. But Mr Miliband, who beat his elder brother David to the Labour leadership in 2010, ended up laughing off the attack, responding: 'Come on Boris, you're better than that.' Animated: Boris Johnson wags a finger at Miliband, who appears to have a clenched fist, on the Andrew Marr Show this morning. The rivals' encounter quickly descended into a slanging match . No let-up: The Tory and Labour politicians go at it hammer and tongs in front of their TV audience . The heated exchange ends with presenter Andrew Marr (right) injecting and the men trying to laugh about it . Mr Johnson's verbal mauling of the Labour leader comes after the Tories were accused of 'descending into the gutter' for claiming that Mr Miliband may 'stab the country in the back' by doing a deal with the SNP to get into power. But today, Mr Johnson insisted that Labour could not take power without the support of the SNP, and claimed the prospect was 'actually deeply alarming'. He said Mr Miliband would have to take help from the Scottish party 'crouching on his back like a monkey' - making it impossible for him to govern in the interests of the whole UK. The London Mayor added: I am not saying that your brother had to present himself at A&E with a dagger in his back... [but] he [Ed Miliband] would do more damage to this country than he did to his brother, and that is the key point.' Verbal onslaught: Mr Johnson said that Labour could not take power without the support of the SNP . Time to go: Mr Johnson and Mr Miliband leave the politics programme after their massive on-air argument . Mr Miliband arrived at the BBC studios in Central London by car, while Mr Johnson cycled there . Ed Miliband won the Labour leadership in September 2010 by narrowly beating his brother David, who had been the runaway favourite for the top job. The younger sibling won the ballot by just over 1 per cent after the second, third and fourth preference votes came into play. David had garnered the majority of support from Labour MPs and party members - but Ed was ahead with the trade-union members. He hugged David after the result was announced - but later admitted the decision to stand against him caused deep division between the brothers. David stayed on as an MP until 2013, then announced he was quitting Parliament to become head of the giant New York-based charity International Rescue Committee. Mr Miliband hit out at the Conservatives for their campaign, saying: 'They are so desperate they are reduced to trying to set one part of the country against another.' Mr Johnson insisted the Conservative attacks on the SNP were not risking the union. 'I'm so proud and so positive about what's happening in this country at the moment, and I just think there are unnecessary risks involved in this Labour-SNP condominium,' he said. 'So the answer would be, no I don't think we are in any way imperiling the union. The people who would imperil the union, because that's what their party is called, is the Scottish Nationalist Party. 'And I imagine their strategy - like the parable, or the fable, of the frog and the scorpion - is to be allowed to be carried across the river and then ultimately to sting... [he is cut off]' The Conservatives have made the prospect of a Labour administration that's reliant on SNP votes one of the central planks of their election campaign in the last fortnight. But Mr Miliband has repeatedly insisted that he will not make any 'deals' with the SNP to become Prime Minister. And he told Andrew Marr today: 'No coalition, no tie-ins, I have said no deals - I have been clear about that. I am not doing deals with the Scottish Nationalist Party.' Asked explicitly whether he was ruling out a confidence-and-supply agreement, he replied: 'No deals.' Ed Miliband and Boris Johnson livened up the election campaign this morning when they went head-to-head on live TV. After being interviewed separately by presenter Andrew Marr, the pair of would-be Prime Ministers were brought together to challenge each other directly. Mr Miliband kicked off the heated exchange by demanding to know if Mr Johnson backed rules that allow wealthy foreigners living in Britain to avoid tax on their overseas earnings. He said: ‘Are you for keeping non-dom status? You’re defending those people who come here, they live here for 30 years, they are permanently here and they don’t pay taxes here.’ Mr Johnson responded: ‘Hang on, is this the Ed Miliband who was in the Treasury with Gordon Brown for about ten years? Are you the same creature? I mean, is there some sort of doppelganger going on?’ The Labour leader hit back, saying: ‘Don’t get rattled, come on now. Andrew Marr interjected to ask the London Mayor to defend inflammatory remarks in which he had accused Mr Miliband of being a back stabber. He said: ‘You attacked Ed Miliband very forcibly today, Boris, for backstabbing. Do you really think that is a fair approach to somebody who is standing in an election? Before Mr Johnson could speak, Mr Miliband said: ‘He doesn’t believe it. Come on, Boris, you are better than that.’ But the London Mayor replied: ‘I am not saying that your brother had to present himself at A&E with a dagger in his back. But he would do more damage to this country than to his brother - and that is the key point.’","London Mayor appeared with Mr Miliband on BBC1's Andrew Marr Show .

"Jeremy Clarkson has finally spoken out about his high-profile sacking from Top Gear, admitting he will 'miss' fronting the BBC2 show. Clarkson, 54, who was fired in March after attacking a producer during filming, has not publicly addressed his dismissal, apart from to say that 'everyone's upset'. But the presenter today gave his 'heartfelt thanks' to those who sent their support in the aftermath of his sacking, saying he would 'miss being there'. It came as Ms Rippon, 70, who first presented the show 38 years ago, said she would be keen to return to the motoring show if she were invited back. Scroll down for video . Jeremy Clarkson (left) today revealed he would 'miss' fronting Top Gear, as it emerged that former presenter Angela Rippon (right) would be keen to return to the motoring show . Ms Rippon, 70, who first presented the show 38 years ago, said it would be 'great' if she were invited back to front Top Gear . Writing in The Sun, Clarkson said: 'Heartfelt thanks to all those who have written to say how much they will miss me on Top Gear. It's not as much, however, as I'll miss being there.' Clarkson was dropped by the BBC after an internal investigation found he had launched an 'unprovoked' 30-second physical attack on producer Oisin Tymon because he was offered a plate of cold cuts instead of steak and chips. The presenter was found to have split the producer's lip and verbally abused him. Following weeks of speculation over the star's future, Lord Hall, the director-general of the corporation, publicly announced  that the BBC would not be renewing Clarkson's contract. He said Clarkson had 'crossed the line' and that 'there cannot be one rule for one and one rule for another'. Now, with the future of the show still up in the air, former newsreader Ms Rippon said it would be 'great' if she was invited back. Clarkson, who was dropped by the BBC after launching an 'unprovoked' 30-second physical attack on producer Oisin Tymon. today gave his 'heartfelt thanks' to those who have supported him . She told The Daily Mirror: 'It would be great if they said ""let's get the old girl back to do the odd film for us"". What I did all those years ago is totally different to what they do now. 'If a programme is going to have longevity, which Top Gear has, it has to keep evolving.' She added that there should be a woman included in the team - because half the drivers on the road are female. Jodie Kidd, the former model, has already been linked to the show. It also emerged last month that DIY SOS star Nick Knowles could become the new Top Gear presenter because the BBC believe he is a 'safe pair of hands'. Meanwhile, BBC bosses are said to be desperately trying to hold onto James May (left) and Richard Hammond (right) - Clarkson's co-presenters - for the BBC2 show . Mr May has previously said that the trio 'came as a package', while Hammond - not ruling out a return - said the sacking marked 'the end of an era' But BBC bosses are reportedly still trying to persuade Richard Hammond and James May to continue with the show, in a bid to cling onto long-term fans. Although May, 52, and Hammond, 45, have both hinted separately that they do not see a future with Top Gear, both have remained silent on the issue for the past few weeks. A source told the Daily Mirror: 'Richard is a TV presenter and this could be his chance to become top dog - he's been on the show a bit longer than James. That is a big opportunity to pass over.' They added: 'It would be a great shame to lose all the talent in one go - re-booting it from scratch would be a far harder task than replacing one.' Mr May has previously said that the trio 'came as a package', while Hammond - not ruling out a return - said the sacking marked 'the end of an era'. But little has been said since the initial reaction to the sacking. Some believe the presenters are remaining silent while waiting for bids from rival channels, which may want to sign up the group as a trio. All three were on the cusp of signing new three-year deals when the Clarkson fracas unfolded. Some believe the pair are remaining silent while waiting for bids from rival channels, which may want to snap up the former Top Gear group as a trio . The day after Clarkson's sacking, May gave a big hint that he has no plans to return to Top Gear, suggesting he is to ‘go back to normal life.’ The presenter admitted he was already considering what to do next with his life - and suggested he might even ditch cars to become a teacher. He said: 'I might want to do something completely different with my life, I'm quite old now. (I might do) something outside of cars, I always wanted to be a teacher.' He also seemed to confirm speculation that he would leave the top-rating programme, saying: 'We always knew it wasn't going to last forever'. Clarkson, 54, was sacked after attacking Oisin Tymon in an episode which Lord Hall said had 'crossed the line' But the BBC's creative director Alan Yentob previously made it clear he wanted May and Hammond to continue presenting the show without Clarkson, despite acknowledging it would be 'perfectly natural' for them to have reservations about continuing. He said: 'It's perfectly natural for them. They are a team they have worked together for a very long time, they are all very attached. 'If Jeremy is not in it and Richard and James are, that needs to be a conversation with them as well. They need to be happy about what's going on and where they think the programme needs to be.' May fronts several other TV programmes, including the popular James May's Toy Stories, James May's Man Lab and Oz and James' Big Wine Adventure with wine expert Oz Clarke. Hammond has a successful career as a children’s television host, fronting the second series of National Geographic's Science of Stupid. He also hosted BBC1’s physical game show Total Wipeout and the CBBC series Blast Lab before they were axed. Clarkson, May and Hammond are scheduled to take part in the live Top Gear shows next month. But the shows have been renamed, without BBC branding. Earlier this month North Yorkshire Police said that following an investigation Clarkson would face no further police action over his attack on the producer at a hotel. Clarkson pulled out of his planned appearance hosting BBC satirical show Have I Got News For You, which was due to be filmed next week, and aired a day later. It would have marked his first BBC appearance since the fracas which led to his departure.","Clarkson has not spoken publicly about sacking since news broke in March .

"(CNN)Giovanni Lo Porto put himself in harm's way to help, heading to Pakistan to work on a much needed reconstruction project following deadly flooding there. His work and his life, as he knew it then, came to a halt on January 19, 2012. That's when, according to Italy's state-run ANSA news agency, four armed men burst into the building where Lo Porto lived and abducted him along with colleague Bernd Muehlenbeck. Two years later, Lo Porto was dead -- killed accidentally by a U.S. drone strike, according to American authorities. The native of the Sicilian city of Palermo died along with a fellow al Qaeda hostage, American Warren Weinstein. That same counterterrorism operation in a border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan killed at least one al Qaeda leader, Ahmed Farouq, who was also a U.S. citizen. His family members, including his four brothers, called him Giancarlo. Lo Porto grew up in Sicily and then studied at London Metropolitan University, getting his undergraduate degree there in Peace and Conflict Studies in 2010, according to the school. A professor there remembers him as ""passionate, friendly (and) open-minded,"" according to an ANSA report. And the university, in a statement, described him as ""a popular student who was committed to helping others."" ""We are tremendously proud of him and the humanitarian work he did,"" the school said. At the time he was taken captive, Lo Porto worked with the German aid organization Welthungerlife, a 53-year-old group dedicated to fighting hunger and poverty worldwide. Such work means going to places where the need is most -- places like Multan in Pakistan. That community was one of many in Pakistan devastated by major flooding in 2010, which covered about one-fifth of the country and left more than 1,500 people dead. These conditions are all too common in the South Asian nation, as evidenced by flooding one year later that forced upwards of 660,000 into refugee camps and killed more than 430 people, about a quarter of whom were children. ""He told me, 'I'm pleased to have returned to Asia and Pakistan, I love the people, culture and food in this part of the world,' "" said the London Metropolitan University professor. Specifically, Lo Porto was a project manager with Welthungerlife's clean water and sanitation program, working with 8 to 10 fellow international staffers and 100 to 200 locals starting in October 2011, according to Simone Pott, a spokeswoman for the aid group. Pott described Lo Porto as a lively, very positive man who made friends all over the world. Some of those friends in Italy, England and beyond pressed for Lo Porto's release after he was taken captive, urging Italy's government and newspaper editors to get his story out, ANSA reported. The same story said that al Qaeda (after first claiming he was being held) denied abducting Lo Porto, as did the Pakistani Taliban. Muehlenbeck, a German national, was freed last October, at which time he said that he and his colleague had been separated, according to ANSA. But Lo Porto never got the chance to savor freedom again, like his German counterpart. Italian Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni said his country's government ""carried out every effort possible to trace and try to return Giovanni to his loved ones."" ""Unfortunately, the conclusion is now different (than we wanted) because of the tragic and fatal mistake of our American allies, which has been recognized by President Obama,"" Gentiloni said. ""The responsibility of his death and (that) of Warren Weinstein ... is that of the terrorists."" On Thursday, after the U.S. government reported Lo Porto's death, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi expressed his ""deepest sorrow for the death of an Italian who dedicated his life to the service of others."" Lo Porto's death left those at his former charity Welthungerlife speechless and confused, Pott said. And then there are his family members like his mother, who ANSA reports became ""another person"" after her son's kidnapping. ""Her only hope was to embrace Giovanni,"" a neighbor said. CNN's Hadia Messia contributed to this report.","NGO where Lo Porto works describes him as a lively, positive man with lots of friends .

"(CNN)He might have just won one of sport's most prestigious events, but it wasn't long before Jordan Spieth's thoughts turned to his autistic sister in the glow of victory. The 21-year-old golfer equaled Tiger Woods' 1997 record winning score of 18 under par to realize his childhood ambitions of donning the green jacket on Sunday as he swept through the field to become Masters champion at Augusta. An ice-cool display made him the second-youngest winner -- behind only Woods, who was 155 days younger that year -- and only the fifth man to have led from start to finish over the tournament's four days. ""I miss her a lot, and I wish she could have been here,"" Spieth told CNN's Don Riddell in the aftermath of his triumph as he opened up about younger sibling Ellie, who was not able to attend the tournament. ""But I can't wait to get back to her and maybe let her try on the jacket. ""I'll have to bring her back a present from here. That's what she'll be expecting."" Amid all the pressure of playing professional golf, Spieth's 14-year-old sister provides him with perspective. ""How has she shaped my upbringing? Well, she's the most special part of our family. She's the funniest part of our family,"" he said. ""I love having her around. She's an incredible sister, my biggest supporter. She is somebody who you can watch and then reflect on the big picture of life and understand that all these frustrations in a day, or in a round of golf, are really secondary. ""We wouldn't have that realization without her."" At the age of just 14, the prodigy from Texas -- who was named after basketball legend Michael Jordan -- had been clear about what he wanted: his aim was to take the Masters title one day. And he betrayed virtually no sign of nerves throughout his stunningly dominant performance, letting slip only a muttered ""oh dear"" when he marginally sliced a tee shot halfway through the final round. Last year, Spieth lost the lead just before the nine-hole turn on the last day -- but he never looked like being denied this time, beating Phil Mickelson's Masters record of 26 birdies for good measure. ""To sit with this jacket on and to be a part of the history of Augusta National and the Masters was something I watched slip away last year,"" said Spieth, who described the reality of winning as ""even better"" than his dreams. ""I had a chip on my shoulder (about that). I carried some momentum into this week and it all came together, right at the right time."" Shown a picture of himself wearing one of the most coveted pieces of clothing in sport, Spieth, born in Dallas, added: ""Putting on the jacket, it looks good. It looks good. I'm OK wearing green!"" He couldn't stop grinning as he said that he hoped to be finishing his final Masters appearance in 50 years' time, but added that he would ""still remember what it was like walking up the 18th hole today."" And as he looked less far ahead, he revealed that he would be staying true to his roots at next year's Champions Dinner. Asked what he would put on the menu for that event, he said: ""It would be some form of Texas BBQ."" The unassuming Spieth's success brings to mind other stars whose supreme ability and self-belief saw them become major champions in the early days of their careers. In 1985, German tennis player Boris Becker stunned Wimbledon when, at the age of 17, he defeated Kevin Curren to become the event's youngest ever men's champion -- a record that still stands today. Becker said people ""thought I had done something I wasn't supposed to do, something that shouldn't have been possible. But I did it -- and then I did it again at 18, just to make the point."" American player Michael Chang was 118 days younger than Becker when he won the French Open in 1989, while Swiss star Martina Hingis was just 16 when she triumphed at the 1997 Australian Open. Last year, at the age of only 15, Martin Odegaard became Norway's youngest international footballer when he played in a friendly against the United Arab Emirates, provoking huge media interest and the attention of Europe's top clubs, before he signed for Spanish giant Real Madrid. For them, as for Spieth, perhaps success was meant to be from the earliest days. And as he looked at a picture of himself with a golf club in hand, taken at the age of 6 or 7 at his grandparents' home in North Carolina, he reflected on the determination that had put him in the green jacket, referring to another Major winner. ""How about the focus on that swing?"" he asked. ""That's a little John Daly-like there, isn't it?""","Jordan Spieth hails autistic younger sibling as his biggest supporter .

"Arsene Wenger insists his woeful record against Jose Mourinho will have no bearing on Arsenal's top-of-the-table clash with Chelsea at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday.

Arsene Wenger has drawn five and lost seven of his 12 clashes with Jose Mourinho ahead of facing Chelsea . Wenger and Mourinho rowed on the touchline in October's 2-0 win for Chelsea in the reverse fixture . 'I think we have not always lost in 12 attempts. We have been close,' Wenger said. 'Having said that, the result on Sunday will just be down to the performance on the day. We are on a good run and we have an opportunity at home to beat them and we want to take it. 'We have a good run of form and good belief and solidarity. We have passed many tests recently when we were questioned. We have another test on Sunday that we want to pass. 'Chelsea's strengths are they have been very efficient on counter attacks and set-pieces as well. We have to nullify their strengths.' Asked about his frosty relationship with Mourinho, Wenger said: 'I do not want to talk about that. What is interesting for people is when the game starts at 4pm we have a great game. It is not about the relationship between the managers.' The managers of London's two biggest clubs have long had a frosty relationship in the opposing dugouts . Cesc Fabregas set up Diego Costa to seal a 2-0 victory for Chelsea against Arsenal earlier this season . Arsenal are 10 points behind Chelsea but come into the game on the back of excellent form. Wenger said: 'Look, mathematically it will be possible, yes, but Chelsea has their future and the championship in their hands. We can get closer and we have an opportunity to do that at home and want to take it.' Wenger added: 'They have been very consistent until now. They have fewer losses than any team. The Premier League rewards consistency. On that front they gave been defensively very strong and consistent.' Fabregas gets ahead of his now-team-mate Branislav Ivanovic to score against Chelsea for Arsenal in 2010 . Sunday's game marks the return of former Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas, who will be wearing Chelsea blue at the Emirates for the first time. Fabregas left for Barcelona in 2011. Arsenal supporters are expected to give their former hero a hot reception after he joined their fierce rivals, but Wenger has asked for some respect for one of their best players of the last decade. 'I want every player to be respected, and Cesc Fabregas when he comes to the Emirates on Sunday to be respected like he deserves,' he said. Asked if he regretted not signing Fabregas in the summer when he had the option to, Wenger added: 'The regret I have is that he wanted to leave here. 'This club and myself had a very positive influence on Cesc’s life, so I would be a bit uncomfortable to have to justify today why he is not here. I believe I would rather it was the other way around.' Wenger is without Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Mikel Arteta on Sunday, while Per Mertesacker is rated as '50-50' by his manager having not trained at all this week. Gunners fans welcome back Fabregas with Barcelona, but the reception is likely to be more frosty this time .","Arsenal face table-topping Chelsea at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday .

"Yaya Toure will not be forced out of Manchester City, but the club are set to make the midfielder available this summer. Sportsmail revealed earlier this week that the Barclays Premier League champions will listen to offers for the Ivorian as they look to reshape their squad after a disappointing season. But Toure will fight for his City career this summer despite the club pondering his future. Yaya Toure will not be forced out of Manchester City, but the club are set to make him available this summer . Sportsmail revealed earlier this week that the  Premier League champions will listen to offers for the Ivorian . He is said to be content with life at the Etihad Stadium despite the difficulties and is in no rush to leave. The Ivorian has played a major role during City's recent trophy-laden period, helping the club to two Premier League titles, an FA Cup and League Cup since joining from Barcelona in 2010. And the powerhouse midfielder still believes he can have a major impact for City in the future and remains fully committed to the cause. Another stumbling block towards a potential move is the four-time African Player of the Year winner's wages. Inter Milan, managed by Roberto Mancini, are interested but given his huge wages there are some doubts . Toure has more than two years left on his current £220,000-a-week deal and is unlikely to move for anything less. A number of clubs, such as Inter Milan, are interested in the 31-year-old, but given his huge salary there must be doubts over whether they would be able to afford it. Inter are prepared to offer Toure a five-year deal to compensate for the pay-cut he would be required to take if he moved to Italy — although, it remains to be seen whether he'd agree to such a compromise. There have been preliminary talks about a contract extension for Toure at City — which included the possibility of an ambassadorial role when he hangs up his boots. But it seems the club are now happy for him to leave. City, meanwhile, will resist any attempt by Valencia to pull out of a £24million deal for Alvaro Negredo to fund a move for Radamel Falcao, currently on loan at Manchester United. City will resist any attempt by Valencia to pull out of a £24million deal for Alvaro Negredo this summer . Negredo joined Valencia on loan last summer and the agreement included a clause involving a permanent move to the Mestalla. Reports in Spain  suggested that Valencia are having second thoughts about keeping Negredo next season, but City are adamant that the deal will go through as planned. The 29-year-old striker scored 23 goals in his first season at the Etihad following a £20.6m move from Sevilla, but he has only found the net five times for Valencia. When he scored in Monday’s 3-0 win over Levante, the Spain striker refused to celebrate, fuelling speculation over his future at the club. Negredo joined Valencia on loan last summer but reports in Spain say they are looking at Radamel Falcao . Victory kept Valencia in fourth place in La Liga and on course to qualify for the Champions League, but financial problems mean they are already struggling to hold onto key players like defender Nicolas Otamendi. It has, however, not stopped Valencia being linked with a summer move for Falcao, who is set to leave United at the end of his season-long loan from Monaco. Falcao’s agent Jorge Mendes has been acting as an advisor to Valencia owner Peter Lim and offloading Negredo is seen as one way of affording the Colombia star. City had scouts at Porto, watching their 3-1 Champions League win over Bayern Munich on Wednesday night, with the home team’s Brazilian left-back Alex Sandro said to be the main focus of interest.

"The majority of people taking antidepressants may not actually have depression, a new study claims. Researchers discovered more than two-thirds (69 per cent) of people taking antidepressants did not meet the criteria for major depressive disorder, which is also known as clinical depression. Antidepressants are also prescribed for other psychiatric disorders. But the researchers found 38 per cent of those taking the drugs did not meet the criteria for obsessive compulsive disorder, panic disorder, social phobia or generalised anxiety disorder either. Scroll down for video . More than two thirds of people taking antidepressants did not meet the criteria for clinical depression . The U.S. investigators looked at those taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), the most commonly prescribed type of anti-depressant. SSRIs are usually the first choice medication for depression and other psychiatric conditions because they generally have fewer side effects than most other types of antidepressant. Writing in the report,  published in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, the researchers concluded: ‘Many individuals prescribed antidepressants may not have met the criteria for mental disorders. ‘Our data indicates that antidepressants are commonly used in the absence of clear evidence-based indications.’ Commenting on the study, Dr Howard Forman, medical director of the Addiction Consultation Service at Montefiore Medical Center, said clinical depression is distinct from temporary feelings of sadness. He told Medical Daily: 'We all experience periods of stress, periods of sadness, and periods of self-doubt. 'These don’t make us mentally ill, they define us as human.' In the U.S., official guidelines say clinical depression should be diagnosed if a person has five or more depressive symptoms over a two week period, most of the day, nearly every day. The symptoms include a depressed mood; a loss of interested or pleasure in activities; weight loss, weight gain or changes in appetite; insomnia or increased desire to sleep. In the U.S., official guidelines say clinical depression should be diagnosed if a person has five or more depressive symptoms over a two week period, most of the day, nearly every day. The symptoms include a depressed mood; a loss of interest or pleasure in activities; weight loss, weight gain or changes in appetite; insomnia or increased desire to sleep. Other symptoms include restlessness or slowed behaviour; fatigue or loss of energy; feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt; difficulty making decisions or trouble concentrating, and thoughts of death or suicide. Other symptoms included restlessness or slowed behaviour; fatigue or loss of energy; feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt; difficulty making decisions or trouble concentrating, and thoughts of death or suicide. Prescriptions for anti-depressants have more than trebled since 1998 in the world’s richest countries, a study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development found. The research noted a particular rise in in the use of SSRIs like Prozac and Seroxat. The OECD figures showed Iceland to have the highest prescribing rate, at 106 doses a day for every 1,000 inhabitants in 2011, up from 71 a decade earlier. Behind Iceland is Australia, then Canada, Denmark, Sweden and Portugal. The lowest levels were seen in Chile and South Korea. Separate data from the US shows 11 per cent of Americans over 12-years-old use anti-depressants. As part of the new study, doctors used data from the Baltimore Epidemiologic Catchment Area (ECA) Study Wave 1, which began in 1981, up to Wave 4, which ended in 2005. In total, they used data on 1,071 participants, carrying out four interviews and assessing the use of antidepressants. They found 13 per cent of people in the group reported using antidepressants. The study found 38 per cent of SSRI users did not meet the criteria for obsessive compulsive disorder, panic disorder, social phobia or generalized anxiety disorder or clinical depression (file photo) It's thought that SSRIs work by increasing the levels of a chemical called serotonin in the brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter (a messenger chemical that carries signals between nerve cells in the brain). It's thought to have a good influence on mood, emotion and sleep. After carrying a message, serotonin is usually reabsorbed by the nerve cells (known as 'reuptake'). SSRIs work by blocking ('inhibiting') reuptake, meaning more serotonin is available to pass further messages between nearby nerve cells. The NHS Choices website while it would be too simplistic to say that depression and related mental health conditions are caused by low serotonin levels, a rise in serotonin levels can improve symptoms and make people more responsive to other types of treatment. Source: NHS Choices . They then assessed whether the people in this group met the criteria for a mental disorder, as laid out in the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the U.S. bible for psychiatric conditions. They found that 38 per cent of SSRI users did not meet the criteria for a mental disorder, and 69 per cent did not meet the criteria for major depressive disorder. The news comes after a study found women who take antidepressants during pregnancy are more likely to have a baby with autism. The U.S. study supports previous research which has shown that taking SSRI antidepressants during pregnancy increases a woman’s risk of having a child with the developmental disability. And other American research revealed young adults taking high-dose antidepressants such as Prozac and Seroxat have double the risk of suicidal behaviour. Researchers pointed to previous studies, which found antidepressant drugs are linked with an increased risk of suicidal behaviour and thoughts in children and adolescents, particularly in the early stages of treatment.","Study analysed those taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)

"Lionel Messi is not the best player in the world, neither is Cristiano Ronaldo - that title belongs to Paris Saint-Germain forward Javier Pastore, according to Eric Cantona. Making a rare foray into discussing football matters, Manchester United legend Cantona delivered his surprising verdict that the Argentine was the ‘most creative’ player in the world. ‘The best player in the world, the most exciting player in the world, is [Javier] Pastore from Paris Saint-Germain,’ said Cantona, ‘Why? Because I watched two games just to see Pastore playing, giving passes. He has got something special. Because football is interactive, it's why football is so popular, I think.’ Javier Pastore (right) celebrates after winning the French League Cup with PSG last Saturday . The Argentina international is the best player in the world, according to former striker Eric Cantona . The former Manchester United forward was speaking at the Laureus World Sports Awards in Shanghai . Pastore, who cost the French league leaders £29million, has three goals and five assists this season compared with Messi’s 45 goals for Barcelona and Cristiano Ronaldo’s 51 for Spanish rivals Real Madrid. But statistics did not colour Cantona’s assessment. ‘Pastore can do things that the other ones don't know, he does things that surprise you every time. Not only in scoring goals, spectacular goals - everything. Just passing. He's a very creative player. He's the most creative player, I think, in the world today. It's why I think he's the best player in the world, because I love this kind of player.’ Cantona was third in the Ballon d’Or in 1993 behind Roberto Baggio and Dennis Bergkamp. He won the Premier League four times with United before retiring from playing aged 30. No stranger to prompting debate, Cantona invited more controversy by suggesting Spain had only won the World Cup because of the influence of Barcelona on the national team. Cristiano Ronaldo was crowned the best player in the world for 2014 at the award ceremony in January . The Real Madrid forward has scored 51 goals in all competitions this season . Barcelona forward Lionel Messi has also been overlooked by Cantona despite netting 45 times this season . ‘Catalonia won the World Cup,’ said Cantona, speaking at the Laureus World Sports Awards in Shanghai. ‘Spain won it with 10 Barcelona players in the team. Spain did not win the World Cup, Catalonia did. Barcelona won it. ‘My grandparents are from Catalunya, from Barcelona. They arrived in France in '39. There was a civil war. So, I am very proud of Barcelona and all that they have done. ‘I’m sure that as soon as the youth set-up from Barcelona and other Spanish teams draw new, good players, Spain will emerge again.’","Eric Cantona says PSG midfielder Javier Pastore is world's best player .

"Men with advanced prostate cancer could benefit from a pioneering drug originally meant for women. Clinical trials show that olaparib can delay the moment when the disease gets dangerously out of control. The drug already works for women with cancer fuelled by BRCA gene mutations, the defect that led to actress Angelina Jolie having her ovaries removed. New ‘exciting’ new research suggests the drug, already used to treat women with breast cancer, could also help men with genetic faults within their prostate cancer (pictured) tumours . Up to 30 per cent of men with advanced prostate cancer have tumours that have DNA defects and these respond particularly well to olaparib. The London trial of olaparib, which is owned by AstraZeneca, was led by researchers at the Institute of Cancer Research and the Royal Marsden hospital. They found 16 out of 49 men with advanced prostate cancer responded to the drug, also known as Lynparza. It stopped prostate cancer growth, generating lower tumour cell counts in the blood and improved responses in medical scans. The drug - called olaparib - can extend the length of time that a prostate cancer patient lives with the disease without it getting worse, according to new clinical trials. Olaparib is the first cancer drug to target inherited genetic mutations. It is one of the first of a new class of drugs called PARP inhibitors. PARP inhibitors work by blocking the cancer cell’s ability to repair damage. Cancer cells that have a mutation in a BRCA gene rely completely on the PARP protein to fix the damage. PARP inhibitor drugs suppress this protein and can stop BRCA mutated cells from growing so they eventually die. Side effects from traditional anti-cancer treatments are reduced because only cancer cells with genetic defects are targeted. Most of the men who had detectable DNA repair mutations had disease control lasting much longer than expected. This suggests the men most likely to benefit from the drug could be identified by testing to look for mutations. Olaparib became the first of a new class of drugs called PARP inhibitors to be granted approval last month for use in ovarian cancer by the European Commission and the US Food and Drug Administration. The inhibitors work by blocking the cancer cell’s ability to repair damage. Cancer cells that have a mutation in a BRCA gene rely completely on the PARP protein to fix the damage. The inhibitor drugs suppress this protein and can stop mutated cells from growing. Side effects from traditional anti-cancer treatments are reduced because only tumour cells with genetic defects are targeted. Professor Johann de Bono, who was the trial chief investigator, said: ‘This opens up the exciting possibility of delivering precise treatment for advanced prostate cancer, guided by genomic testing and based on the molecular characteristics of patients’ tumours. 'It shows that PARP inhibitors can be effective in a wider group of patients than had been thought – in men as well as women, patients with mutations in their tumours as well as those with inherited mutations, and in those with a wider range of gene defects.’ The drug, olaparib, is the first cancer drug to target inherited genetic mutations. It works by blocking the cancer cell’s ability to repair damage . Dr Emma Hall of the Institute of Cancer Research said: ‘We’ve seen a significant improvement in the length of good quality life men can hope to live even with the most advanced prostate cancers. 'These encouraging results show that olaparib could be the next drug to add to those already available.’ The results of the trial were presented at the American Association of Cancer Research conference in Philadelphia. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence will now decide whether olaparib should become widely available on the NHS. A decision is expected in September. Dr Iain Frame of Prostate Cancer UK said: ‘We want to get to a stage where every man gets the treatment he needs for his specific cancer.’ Researchers did not specify the length of time for which olaparib was able to stop advanced prostate cancer worsening.","Olaparib is the first cancer drug to target inherited genetic mutations .

"Former England captain Mike Gatting believes Kevin Pietersen should not walk straight back into the international set-up, even if he piles on the runs for Surrey this season. Pietersen has returned to the LV= County Championship in a bid to stake a claim for an England recall, although the 34-year-old only managed 19 runs against Glamorgan on Sunday. England were held to a draw in the opening Test of a three-match series against West Indies last week, and calls for a Pietersen comeback continue to linger ahead of the Ashes this summer. Kevin Pietersen scored 170 in his first outing for Surrey this season but scored just 19 against Glamorgan . 'There are a few bridges that still need to be rebuilt,' said Gatting, who had just penned a congratulation message to James Anderson, England's leading Test wicket-taker, as part of Slazenger's celebratory flag tour. 'Even if KP scores runs there might not be spaces available. If Gary Ballance, Ian Bell and Joe Root play well, there might not be a place for him. 'You've got to have somebody who isn't playing well to get Pietersen in. 'He doesn't just come straight back - that would be unfair on the people in there at the moment. 'If he does get runs, fine, but that's not the end of it. 'If people are playing well in the team, why should he just get straight in?' Pietersen is keen to play for England again after being sacked in 2014 . Bell and Ballance both hit centuries in Antigua while Root also showed signs of good form with scores of 83 and 59. The scorecard was less encouraging for England captain Alastair Cook, however, who could only manage 11 and 13, stretching his run without a Test century to 33 innings. Cook's poor performances saw him removed as One-Day captain before the World Cup earlier this year and Gatting admits more questions will be asked of the England skipper if he fails to find runs against West Indies. 'Alastair knows what he's got to do, he's got to get some runs,' Gatting said. 'We can keep speculating but I suspect at the end of the West Indies series, they'll look at it and if he hasn't got any runs there might be some questions asked. Gary Ballance scored a century in the first Test against West Indies . 'He might possibly get the series against New Zealand - the fact is Alastair has got more 100s than anyone else has and people do go through bad patches in their careers. 'Alastair has had a break, when he was left out of the One-Day series, he's had time to get himself sorted. 'Maybe he needs a break from the captaincy, that's for people to sit and decide, I suspect it's about the runs though, not the captaincy. 'He's a well-respected man in the team, the fact is he's a batsman, he's a captain and if he fails to get the runs somebody will have to make a decision.' Cook's future may be affected by who the England and Wales Cricket Board chooses for the new director of cricket role, created to replace sacked managing director Paul Downton. Mike Gatting has signed a giant flag congratulating Jimmy Anderson on becoming the leading England wicket taker in Test matches . Michael Vaughan, Andrew Strauss and Alec Stewart have all been mentioned in connection with the post, but Gatting is unsure what the point of the position will be. 'I've tried to think what the role could be,' Gatting said. 'If it's going to be someone more hands on with the team, how is that going to affect the coach? 'Can it be any different to the job Paul Downton did? You do need someone in charge of the overall structure. 'At the end of the day, it's all about the players - it's about how they perform. 'I just hope the ECB don't rush into the decision and they get the right person, because different people will do a different type of job.' Former MCC president Mike Gatting was signing Slazenger's 'Congratulations Jimmy' flag which will be touring the country this week.

"No blame: Baroness Hale of Richmond said that she wanted to see the bitterness taken out of most matrimonial disputes . Divorce laws in England and Wales should remove the need for allegations of adultery and blame, Britain’s most senior female judge has said. Baroness Hale of Richmond said that she wanted to see the bitterness taken out of most matrimonial disputes so a person does not need to be held at fault in order to obtain a divorce. Divorcing couples currently have to cite one of five reasons: adultery; unreasonable behaviour; desertion for two or more years; two years’ separation with consent; or five years’ separation without consent. The second reason – unreasonable behaviour’ – is by far the most widely used. Around 120,000 couples divorce in England and Wales each year and those who want to divorce quickly are encouraged to cite unfaithfulness or unreasonable behaviour, which, critics argue, encourages recriminations. Lady Hale, who is deputy president to the Supreme Court and the only woman among the 12 Supreme Court justices, also wants couples to be made to sort out arrangements for children and money before obtaining a divorce as part of the overhaul. She told The Times: ‘We should make it take longer to get a divorce and encourage people to sort out what happens to the home, children, money before, rather than after, they get a divorce.’ Couples would have a one-year ‘cooling off period’ after declaring that their marriage had permanently broken down in order for them to sort out arrangements. Lady Hale, 70, was behind the move for ‘no fault’ divorce in England and Wales 20 years ago. Conservative MPs saw off the proposals and said that removing fault would take away responsibility and undermine the concept of marriage. Last night campaigners and lawyers backed the proposed overhaul. Resolution: Lady Hale also wants arrangements for children and money resolved before divorce is finalised . Sir Paul Coleridge, former family High Court judge and chairman of the Marriage Foundation, told The Times: ‘Lady Hale, a complete expert with decades of experience across this whole field, is entirely right. ‘Our current system which pretends to be fault-based is in practice and reality no such thing. 'The fault is largely invented to get a quick divorce — a hangover from pre-1970 days which is manipulated by lawyers and parties.’","Baroness Hale of Richmond wants to see 'bitterness' taken out of disputes .

"Manny Pacquiao has become one of the most recognisable stars in the world of sport after a series of mega-fights and another one to follow on Saturday night against Floyd Mayweather at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. The Filipino has been involved in some of the biggest bouts in the world over the past decade or so, facing the likes of Oscar De La Hoya, Ricky Hatton, Miguel Cotto and four fights against Mexican warrior Juan Manuel Marquez. But it's been a tough road to the top for Pacquiao from being born into poverty in the Philippines.

Ever since dethroning the South African world champion on that June night at the MGM Grand 14 years ago, Pacquiao hasn't looked back and is set to take on Mayweather in the Fight of the Century on Saturday. Just days away from the $300million showdown on the Vegas Strip, pictures have emerged of Pacquiao as a teenager in a Manila boxing gym, when occasions such as this Saturday night were just a dream. Pacquiao moved away from home a the age of 14 to the country's capital Manila to pursue his boxing career and the rest, as they say, is history. The 36-year-old is now one of the biggest stars in the world. These incredible pictures show Pacquiao training at the LM Gym in Manila in 1996 at the age of 17 after he won his first 10 professional bouts - all of which were in 1995. In the same year that these pictures were taken, Mayweather was preparing to box at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, which ended for him in a controversial loss  against Serafim Todorov in the semi-finals. Nineteen years later, Mayweather and Pacquiao will finally cross paths in the biggest fight of this generation. The pair will make their first public appearances of the week on Tuesday as the bout draws ever closer. Boxing fans have already begun pouring into Las Vegas to taste the atmosphere building around the richest fight in history, even though only 500 tickets for the clash were made available for general sale. Pacquiao will host a fans' rally on Tuesday at the Mandalay Bay Hotel with trainer Freddie Roach, promoter Bob Arum and his pet Jack Russell Pacman also present. Attention then turns to the MGM Grand, the venue for the fight on Saturday and where Mayweather will be making his grand arrival. The welterweight rivals were both due to attend the traditional grand arrival that marks the beginning of fight week only for Arum to withdraw Pacquiao, claiming the event is a 'waste of time'. Arum also pulled the plug on a media conference call with Pacquiao last week before a question had been asked, while Mayweather spoke for almost half an hour the following night. The one upmanship is sure to continue until fight day. Pacquiao has been involved in some of the biggest fights over the last decade but Saturday's occasion will eclipse all of them .

"These shocking photographs show the bed where a severely disabled boy was left to sleep for seven nights in hospital. They show two mattresses squeezed together on the cramped hospital floor, with wires from an oxygen tank and tubes dangling across the room. Cody Neatis, from Preston, was admitted to Royal Preston Hospital last Thursday with a chest infection. But rather than a bed in the children's ward, has had to sleep on a mattress on the floor since arriving. The eight-year-old - who has Down's syndrome, epilepsy, autism and is fed by a tube - has been without a hospital bed because staff do not have the special cot he needs to keep him safe in his sleep. Cody Neatis, eight, has been in hospital for a week with a chest infection but has had to sleep on a mattress on the floor as the hospital doesn't have a suitable bed for him to sleep in . Cody has Down's syndrome, epilepsy, autism and is fed by a tube. The hospital does not have the specialist high-sided cot he must sleep in, to prevent him from injuring himself in the night . Cody's mother, Lynne Neatis, 48, has had to sleep with Cody - who has a developmental age of 12 months - on the mattress. She watches him sleep in case he pulls out his oxygen or hurts himself in the night . His mother, Lynne, 48, has slept on the floor alongside him for the past week. She fears her son - who has a developmental age of around 12 months - will injure himself or pull out his oxygen. She is now demanding answers from the local health trust as she claims she has waited two years for the high-sided bed needed for Cody and other disabled children. The mother-of-six said: 'Cody was admitted to hospital last Thursday and we were told there was no special needs bed for him. 'This situation has been ongoing  for years with this hospital and I don't understand why they still don't have a suitable bed. 'We had to stay in for nine days in August 2013, I complained about it then and was told that the ward was getting a special needs bed. 'So I fully expected them to have it this time, but there is still nothing.' She added: 'They have baby cots and single beds with side rails, but they aren't safe as Cody rolls around so much in his sleep and is restless all night long. 'I have to sleep on the floor with him and I have had to fight for a nurse or health care assistant to be with us during the night to watch him too as I can't stay awake for 24 hours. 'It has been a very stressful and exhausting time.' Cody's father Stephen Neatis, 45, said he 'cannot believe' his family are forced to sleep on the floor during their stay in hospital . Cody's mother says she has been battling the hospital for a special bed ever since Cody was forced to stay there two years ago in 2013 . While Mrs Neatis is furious at the lack of provisions for disabled children, the hospital trust insists it has ordered a suitable bed from America and is waiting for it to arrive. Karen Partington, chief executive at Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the hospital, said other sleeping arrangements had been offered, but the family had agreed a mattress on the floor would be the safest option at this point. She added: 'We offered Mum the options of a traditional bed plus 1:1 nursing staff and we also brought in a special bed again with 1:1 nursing. 'We believe we have appropriate beds available to meet the needs of Cody along with appropriate nursing support. 'However based on the options available her preference was for Cody to have a mattress on the floor.' Mrs Neatis and husband Stephen, 45, are full time carers not only to Cody, but his brother Dexter, seven, who is also disabled and has autism and ADHD. Cody has to be tube fed and cannot be left unattended. At home he sleeps in a specialist bed which cost more the family more than £3,000. Mr Neatis said he cannot believe his family are forced to sleep on the floor during a stay in hospital. Cody, pictured here with his father, has to be tube fed and can't be left unattended. At home he sleeps in a specialist bed which cost more the family more than £3,000. Mrs Neatis says she has had to ask for staff to come and help her watch Cody sleep, as she can't stay awake 24 hours a day . He said: 'I just can't believe that there is nothing to cater for him, or that they wouldn't try to at least get something for him during the stay. 'I got a call from Lynne and she is having to stay with him on the floor. 'We have one of the special needs beds at home and I saw the two guys assemble it, it took half an hour so it wouldn't be a big job to move one. There must be one somewhere.' Mrs Neatis threatened to take Cody home after finding out the sleeping arrangements but his oxygen levels fall dangerously low when he is taken off the ventilator so he cannot be discharged. She said she was told the hospital did get a special bed and used it on a trial basis, but it proved unsatisfactory. She said: 'When they came up with the idea of sleeping on a mattress on the floor I told them I would take him home as we had a bed there but his oxygen levels were too low. 'I told staff he needs someone to watch him all night long but they made me feel like I was being awkward and said they had no staff to do that. 'I took the photo of Cody and the floor and sent it to my friend who tweeted it and that night we had a nurse, and for the next two nights we had a health care assistant, they were great. Mrs Neatis said when she first heard about the sleeping arrangements at the hospital, she said she would take Cody home. But his oxygen levels were so low that he couldn't be discharged . Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, who run Royal Preston Hospital, say they have ordered a special bed from America and are waiting for it to arrive . The chief executive came to see me and she was really nice. 'But on the fourth night they said there was a staff shortage again so I threatened to take him home - I took his oxygen out but they insisted we stay, and someone did come to watch him. 'Other hospitals have these beds and special needs children are admitted to hospital more often than other children so I don't understand why it's so difficult here. The bed wouldn't be left unused, she claims. She said: 'I know of other parents who have had the same problem and have brought their own special needs beds with them from home.' A spokesperson for the trust told MailOnline that a specialist bed from America was due to arrive in February, but the delivery was delayed. Chief executive Ms Partington added: 'Our priority is to always provide excellent care with compassion for our patients and we have had several discussions with Cody's family regarding his care. 'We are awaiting delivery of a specialist bed from America and we have discussed a number of alternatives with Cody's family, which have been declined.' 'Clearly when making these decisions regarding the care of children we believe it is important to do so in collaboration with parents. We continue to work with her to find a solution that meets Cody's needs and his mum's preferences.'","Cody Neatis, 8, has Down's syndrome, epilepsy and autism and is tube-fed .

"The devastated fiance of the late 'wellness warrior' Jessica Ainscough has written an emotional letter to her followers, revealing she was undergoing radiation treatment in her final weeks and 'giggling and drinking green smoothies' in her hospital bed until the day she died. Ms Ainscough, 30, died in late February following a lengthy fight with a rare and aggressive form of cancer known as epithelioid sarcoma. She spurned chemotherapy and radiation, choosing to fight the cancer with a controversial treatment known as Gerson Therapy, which involves a vegan diet and coffee enemas and does not have scientific support. But after discussions with 'oncologists, healers and specialists around the world', in her final weeks - the most 'difficult' weeks of her fight - Ms Ainscough began a course of targeted radiation, her partner Tallon Pamenter has revealed. 'This was a risky and tough decision, but Jess bravely embraced this last chance option,' he said. Jessica Ainscough (left) was planning to marry her partner Tallon Pamenter this year. She died after a long fight with cancer in February . 'This year has stripped me from the one thing that brought magic to every other aspect of my life,' Mr Pamenter said . Tribute: Jessica Ainscough died in late February after a seven-year-long battle with cancer . 'In true wellness warrior style, we integrated our natural healing regime with the recommended radiation. 'Finally the walls were broken down between conventional and unconventional medicine - I don't know why as a society we must choose one or the other. 'This was something Jess was looking forward with sharing (with her followers). It was an exciting evolution from her earlier days of feeling that she had to be part of one extreme world or the other.' Mr Pamenter said the six weeks of her radiation were among the toughest the couple - who were planning to marry this year - had been through. 'Jess displayed a sense of courage and grace that I am yet to see in anybody else I have ever met - myself included.' The radiation successfully managed to shrink the tumour but 'some complications arose during the final stages of treatment'. 'Not long after, the words I LOVE YOU would leave my lips only to fall softly upon Jess's ears for the last time. 'I said goodbye to the love of my life that day and my heart has been in a million pieces since.' 'Jess displayed a sense of courage and grace that I am yet to see in anybody else I have ever met - myself included,' She 'showed (her partner Tallon) what it means to live in a world full of love', he said in his tribute . 'I said goodbye to the love of my life that day and my heart has been in a million pieces since' 'This year has stripped me from the one thing that brought magic to every other aspect of my life. 'I have been taken to a place so foreign and unknown with no navigational bearing on how to get back. 'Loved ones tell me to be strong during this time... but the thing is I don't want to be strong... I want to cry when I'm sad, yell when I'm angry and smile during those fleeting moments of happiness brought on by the memories we created together. 'I want to sit in silence and be present with every single emotion that decides to show up. 'It's in those moments I feel closest to her.' Ms Ainscough made the decision to undergo radiation after the fungating tumour in her left shoulder became large and painful. It began to interfere with her 'ability to enjoy her favourite things like walking our furbabies on the beach', Mr Parmenter said. Mr Pamenter told Daily Mail Australia she planned to tell her followers about her new treatment just days after she passed away. Ms Ainscough was diagnosed with cancer in 2008 when she was 22 and working at Dolly magazine, a favourite of teenage girls. She initially underwent targeted chemotherapy to her left arm, according to reports, but the cancer returned a year later. She also refused doctors' advice to have her left arm amputated. Jessica's mother was also diagnosed with cancer in 2012, and, inspired by her daughter's fight, she also adopted the Gerson Therapy method. The alternative treatment did not work, and her mother passed away in 2013, an event which Ms Ainscough said brought her to her knees. Mr Pamenter said his partner 'showed me what it means to live in a world full of love'. She was laid to rest in early March.","Devastated fiance of late 'wellness warrior' Jessica Ainscough writes touching tribute to followers .

"West Bromwich Albion had just produced a typical Tony Pulis performance to beat his former club Crystal Palace 2-0 when he claimed he will never change. The 57-year-old’s gritty, resilient playing style is well reflected in the touchline attire he insists on wearing at every game; cap, track suit and shiny white trainers. James Morrison headed in within two minutes and Craig Gardner added a stunning 30-yard strike in the second half, but Alan Pardew’s side dominated the remainder of the game only to be met by West Brom’s stubborn doggedness.

West Brom midfielder James Morrison (right) dribbles with the ball away from Palace's Jason Puncheon (left) All viewed by Pulis beneath the peak of that cap. ‘I’d never take my cap off during a game they’d have to put it in my contract,’ he explained. ‘I watched the first game for Albion and sat upstairs in a suit. I came down after 10 minutes because I’d had enough of sitting there. That’s just the way I am. I want to be close to the action.’ West Brom ended their run of 10 away games without a victory, drawing five and losing five. Pulis will turn up to the stadium in suit and tie, then return to that again straight after the match to address the press before he leaves. Pardew was resplendent in full suit and tie on Saturday. Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino admitted last week that he started smartening up on the sideline after his chairman Daniel Levy told him to. ‘I’ll leave it for all the sophisticated lads,’ Pulis added. ‘I’ve always done it and I don’t see no reason not to just because we’re in the Premier League with all the TV cameras and everything. I’ve done it right from my days at Bournemouth.’ Why change a ritual that works? The three points moved West Brom to 36 points which virtually guarantees them safety. Much like he achieved at Palace last year. That’s worth doffing your cap to. Palace winger Wilfried Zaha (left) is tackled by West Brom's Gardener (right) during the match on Saturday .

"Countdown co-presenter Rachel Riley was left embarrassed on a recent episode of the show when contestants offered up a rather rude eight-letter word as their answer to the word game. Host Nick Hewer faced a conundrum of his own as he tried, and failed, to stifle his giggles as a blushing Ms Riley spelt out the word 'erection'. Hewer, who first found fame as Lord Sugar’s sidekick in The Apprentice, was clearly trying not to laugh when Dubliner Gerry Tynan and Anne Lewin, from Brighton, both offered up the double entendre. Scroll down for video . Countdown co-presenter Rachel Riley looked embarassed when the two contestants  came up with the same eight-letter double entendre in the word game (pictured) as host Nick Hewer failed to stifle his laughter . Fortunately celebrity guest Dr Phil Hammond, who was in dictionary corner with Susie Dent, saved the day with nine letter word 'recondite'. It is not the first time the show's host has struggled to contain himself when a rude word has popped up - last year Hairy Biker Dave Myers offered up the seven-letter word 'todgers', causing much hilarity among the hosts. In February an English teacher shocked viewers when submitting the word 'm*nges', an expletive sometimes used to describe female genitalia. It is not the first time Nick Hewer (pictured) has struggled to contain himself when a rude word has popped up . In 1991, two contestants offered 'w***ers', and in 2010 another suggested 's**tface'. In 2010 the presenters looked uneasy when the letters U, D, F, C, K and E all came up in a selection - but luckily the contestants resisted the temptation to go for the obvious and instead submitted the five letter words 'caged' and 'faced'. It's not the first word to have left Rachel Riley blushing. The former Strictly Come Dancing star found herself stifling laughter after drawing the words 'p*ss' and 'a*se' shortly after replacing Carol Vorderman in 2009. During her 26-year stint, Ms Vorderman was left red-faced more than a few times. Words such as fart, porn and poo were among the collection of letters which had the Loose Women star and her co-hosts laughing.

"Prince Harry will tonight fly out of the UK to Australia without seeing his new niece or nephew . A disappointed Prince Harry will tonight fly out of the UK to Australia without seeing his new niece or nephew. With the Duchess of Cambridge now overdue for the birth of her second child, the prince will not be able to meet the new royal baby until he returns to this country in mid May. Harry, who will be bumped down to fifth in the line of succession by the new arrival, had returned briefly at the weekend to hand out prizes at the London Marathon after undertaking several engagements in Turkey to mark the centenary of the Gallipoli campaign. He was dragging out his return until tonight in the hope of getting to meet the new little prince or princess. But with Duchess now several days overdue, Harry is being forced to return to Australia where he is on a month-long placement with the army, followed by a week long official tour of New Zealand. Instead he spent time playing doting uncle to his nephew, Prince George, who turns two in July, at the Cambridge's apartment at Kensington Palace. Kate and her husband, Prince William, had been told to expect their new son or daughter – who will be fourth in line to the throne – by Saturday, according to sources. The Duchess – whose son, Prince George, was also around a week late - herself told well-wishers earlier this year that the new little prince or princess was due 'mid to late April'. When Prince George's little brother or sister is born the news will be revealed to royal correspondents in a press release followed by an announcement two minutes on the Kensington and Buckingham Palace social media accounts on Twitter and Instagram. Details of their arrival – including their six, birth weight and details of the attending medical staff - will then be posted in the traditional way on an easel outside Buckingham Palace. Scroll down for video . Although palace officials have barred media from camping outside the private Lindo Wing at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, where Kate is due to give birth, in order to prevent what they describe as a 'media circus', excitement was mounting yesterday with royal 'superfans' continuing their own round-the-clock vigil. The Duchess – whose son, Prince George, was also around a week late - herself told well-wishers earlier this year that the new little prince or princess was due 'mid to late April' Harry had returned briefly at the weekend to hand out prizes at the London Marathon after undertaking several engagements in Turkey (pictured) to mark the centenary of the Gallipoli campaign . The mounting tension saw bookmakers' cash in with a flurry of bets on everything from the time of birth to the new baby's name – and even their hair and eye colour. Prince Harry will no doubt be encouraged to see that 4/1 odds are being offered for the baby to be a fellow red head. Ladbrokes customers appeared to favour Arthur for a boy, with odds collapsing to 8/1, and Alice remaining the hot favourite for a girl with odds of just 5/4. Some were still hankering after Diana (14/1), in memory of William's late mother, or even Elizabeth in honour of the Queen (6/1). The firm said one male customer in the Manchester area had bet £10,000 on the new baby being a girl, the largest single wager so far received. Spokesman, Jessica Bridge, said: 'As far as the money is concerned they will soon welcome Princess Alice into the family.' Coral said yesterday that it had seen a slew of bets come in that the baby will arrive today (Monday) – now 6/1 joint favourite – with odds of 10-1 that the nation is still waiting at the end of the week. Many bookmakers are also offering 4/1 odds of the couple welcoming their new child into the world on Wednesday – their fourth wedding anniversary. Prince William and Kate pose with their son Prince George at the National History Museum in London . Preparations have been made outside the Lindo Wing of the hospital for the huge crowds expected to welcome the royal birth - with the Duchess said to be up to four days overdue . As the 'spare to the heir', it is unlikely that the duke and duchess's new baby will accede to the throne – although it is not unheard of. Most recently the Queen's own father became King George VI when his elder brother, King Edward VIII, unexpectedly abdicated over his love for 'unsuitable' American divorcee Wallis Simpson. Thanks to recent changes in the law of succession, if the new baby is girl then their claim to the throne cannot be superseded by a younger brother, should William and Kate go on to have a third child. She will also be known as HRH Princess (forename) of Cambridge after the Queen altered a century-old ruling in the run up to Prince George's birth which had meant that only the eldest son of a Prince of Wales (as well as the children of a monarch and the sons of those children) was entitled to the honour. The new arrival will also bump Prince Andrew out of the 'top five' for the first time. He will drop to sixth in line to the throne. His eldest daughter, Princess Beatrice, will find herself relegated to seventh – the advantage being that she will no longer require the Queen's approval for her marriage. Her younger sister, Princess Eugenie, will become eighth. If the baby is a girl it will be the first Princess of Cambridge to be born for 182 years. Kate has said in the past that she favours a boy but that her husband rather likes the idea of a girl. Grandfather Prince Charles has said he would like a girl – while his late wife, Diana, Princess of Wales, always longed for a daughter.","Prince Harry will  fly out of UK tonight to continue placement in Australia .

"Jameela spent £3,000 on having all her amalgam fillings removed and replaced with white fillings . Jameela Jamil has the dazzling smile that you'd expect of a television presenter and former model. Yet the 29-year-old broadcaster is convinced her teeth - or rather, the dental work done on them - triggered a host of health problems that plagued her for nearly seven years. 'From the age of 21, I would wake up in the morning with a puffy, swollen face feeling utterly hungover - even though I don't drink,' says Jameela, who has presented the Radio 1 Chart Show and programmes for Channel 4. 'My head felt heavy and I was permanently exhausted. Occasionally, I would even faint. There were days when I'd arrive at work and the make-up artists would send me home because I just looked awful and felt terrible.' After several months of this, she went to a private doctor who referred her for tests. Jameela thought she might have a serious disease such as lupus, an auto-immune condition which can cause inflammation and swelling in the joints and other parts of the body. In fact, the tests suggested she had high levels of mercury. After other potential causes such as diet were ruled out, it was suggested the problem was down to the ten amalgam fillings she'd had as a child. So she spent £3,000 on having them all removed and replaced with white fillings. Dental amalgam has been used for more than 150 years, and every year 12 million fillings made from it are given to patients in Britain. Amalgam remains a standard material to use, especially on back teeth because it is particularly robust. It is made from a mixture of metals including silver, tin and copper. Liquid mercury is used to help mix these components together. Breathing in extremely high concentrations of mercury can trigger bronchitis and pneumonia and affect the central nervous system, causing muscle tremors. Long-term exposure to high levels can affect kidneys. But mercury poisoning is very rare, suggests Dr Prem Mahendra, a consultant haematologist at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham. 'In 27 years as a haematologist I have never been asked to test for mercury,' he says. Dentists agree that when fillings are being put in or removed, the mercury can release vapour. This is absorbed into the bloodstream in the lungs and then taken to the kidneys to be passed out harmlessly in the urine. Blood tests showed she had high mercury levels. With nothing else to account for these raised levels, her fillings were pinpointed as the cause . But the amounts taken in from fillings is 'minuscule', says Salford dentist Dr Ben Atkins. Indeed, a review by the EU Commission's Scientific Committee in 2008 concluded there was no risk from amalgam, says Professor Damien Walmsley, the British Dental Association's scientific adviser. Amalgam is 'strong, durable and adaptable' and there is 'no evidence to suggest these fillings are anything other than safe to use', adds StJohn Crean, professor of medicine in dentistry and an oral and maxillofacial surgeon at the University of Central Lancashire. It is true that mercury can sometimes cause sensitivity and soreness in teeth - 5 per cent of the population react to contact with amalgams in this way - but this poses no risk to health, adds Professor Walmsley. And yet dental amalgam is banned in countries such as Sweden and Norway, because of patient concern about the risk. Finland and Japan have restrictions on its use, with a view to phasing it out. This follows research linking mercury to certain diseases. A 2012 review of 106 studies published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease suggested mercury from amalgams could be a contributing factor to the condition. But fillings aren't the only source of mercury. It can get into the blood through food - nearly all fish and shellfish contain traces, though the Food Standards Agency says this isn't a concern for most people. However, some fish and shellfish contain higher levels of mercury that could harm an unborn baby or young child's developing nervous system. That's why young children and women planning to have a baby or who are already pregnant or breastfeeding are advised to avoid fish that can have higher levels of mercury, such as shark, swordfish and marlin. Pregnant women are advised to limit their tuna to no more than two steaks or four medium-sized cans a week. And yet dental amalgam (pictured, posed by model) is banned in countries such as Sweden and Norway, because of patient concern about the risk . But Jameela doesn't eat fish, so knew the mercury levels couldn't be due to her diet. She's allergic to peanuts, shellfish and dairy foods and at 12 was diagnosed with coeliac disease - a condition which causes an adverse reaction to gluten, found in wheat, barley and rye. Following blood tests, it was discovered that she had high mercury levels. With nothing else to account for these raised levels, her fillings were pinpointed as the cause. 'All I could think of was I had to get rid of them,' says Jameela. But while she expected her symptoms to immediately subside once her fillings were removed, they continued to affect her over the next few years. 'I hated the fatigue, the headaches, the fact I should have been fit and healthy but felt rotten all the time,' Jameela says. 'I read up on this and discovered that not only does it take time for mercury levels to drop, but vapour can be released from the mercury when the fillings are removed and leak into the system. 'I think that the mercury was affecting my immune and digestive system.' Dentist Dr Atkins has spoken to many patients who have wanted to have their silver fillings removed because they're concerned about the potential health issues. But he warns that removing amalgams can do more harm than good as more vapour can be inhaled into the system by doing this. 'Aside from the fact there is no evidence to suggest amalgams are anything other than safe, every time a dentist drills a tooth, they remove a little dental tissue. So you are essentially damaging the tooth,' he says. The number of fillings in the average adult's mouth . Still struggling, Jameela saw a nutritionist who recommended drinking solutions made from clay and algae chlorella three times a day. These apparently bind to mercury and help remove it. She did this for two years, and tried various diets to tackle the 'inflammation' linked to the mercury that was making her ill. 'For my 25th birthday, my flatmate gave me a piece of melon with a candle in it - cake was out of the question,' she says. 'It took about a year before I started to feel better. It's all had a massive impact on my life.' However, Anton Emmanuel, consultant gastroenterologist at University College Hospital, London, is not convinced mercury could affect digestion in this way. 'You would have to be exposed to massive overdoses of mercury for the gut to be affected,' he says. 'Not in the level or forms that you get with mercury fillings. 'In fact, I see patients whose gut symptoms, ironically, seem to be caused by the stress and anxiety of thinking that it is their mercury fillings which are causing stomach problems, when there is no physical sign of any gut disorders.' But Jameela remains convinced that the mercury was the cause of her problems. 'There is so much we don't know about amalgam fillings. I know I feel much better now,' she says. Private clinics offer mercury testing. But Dr Mahendra says anyone thinking of having this done should check that the clinic's laboratories have clinical pathology accreditation (CPA) to ensure that the tests are carried out properly.

"Sao Paulo, Brazil (CNN)Hundreds of thousands of Brazilians are taking to the streets in protests across the country, lashing out against President Dilma Rousseff as she struggles with an economic downturn and a massive bribery scandal. The demonstrators have called for the President to be impeached. On the other side Rousseff's base is holding rallies in her support. There are a number of issues at play. One of the biggest: an investigation into a multimillion-dollar kickback scheme at the state-run oil company Petrobras. Petrobras was long considered the corporate jewel in Brazil's crown, one of the biggest companies in the world by market capitalization. But last year, investigators launched a sweeping investigation. According to suspects-turned-witnesses, construction companies paid bribes to executives at Petrobras as well as politicians to secure lucrative contracts. Most of the politicians accused in the investigation belong to the President's Workers Party and its allies. During many of the years that the alleged corruption took place, Rousseff was the chairwoman of Petrobras. There hasn't been any evidence she was involved with the scheme, and her supporters say the position is merely a figurehead. Rousseff has defended Brazilians' right to protest and acknowledged the need to clean up corruption at Petrobras -- but denied any prior knowledge of it. But Brazilians are still outraged. Rousseff won re-election with just over 50% of valid votes in October, but her approval rating plummeted to 13% after the protests last month. Compounding the frustration is the economy, which is expected to contract this year. Inflation is stubbornly high, and the currency has lost more than 20% of its value against the dollar this year alone. Both sides are. The country was already sharply divided during presidential elections in October. Roughly half of the voting population didn't vote for Rousseff, and many of those same people joined protests immediately after elections. Rousseff's supporters like to characterize the protesters as Brazilian elite and right-wingers, and some small groups do carry signs calling for a military intervention to oust the President. But with the Petrobras scandal growing and the economy sinking, the protests have gotten bigger and broader, with many demonstrators saying they initially voted for Rousseff. Protesters say Rousseff should be impeached for failing to halt the corruption at Petrobras. On the other hand, labor unions, social activists and groups such as the Landless Workers Movement who support the government have organized their own marches. The demonstrations are meant as a show of force for democracy, with participants saying the President was democratically elected and cannot be impeached. But participation has not been consistently strong. The President has said Petrobras should be cleaned up. Has she done anything about it? She says she's given prosecutors and the Federal Police free rein to investigate the Petrobas scandal. Some of her allies who have been implicated in the investigation think Rousseff should do more to protect them. This scandal has been known publicly for at least a year, and during Rousseff's election campaign, she said she would root out corruption. The Brazilian economy was booming for the good part of a decade, bolstered by voracious demand for its commodities from China. But with China's economy cooling, Brazil has failed to find a successful alternative to promote growth and shore up investor confidence. Now, with the President's approval rating abysmally low, it will be difficult to implement the savings needed to get the economy back on track. Rousseff has appointed a market-friendly economy minister, Joaquim Levy, to try and fix the country's fiscal problems. But in the current political crisis, he hasn't been able to make much progress.","Protesters angry over bribery scandal involving state-run oil company Petrobras .

"An alleged fraudster has been accused of posing as Oprah Winfrey, executives from her TV network, former Obama aide Reggie Love and Madonna's manager in an attempt to trick people into giving him jobs, clothes, free food and jewelry worth $2.4million. Justin Jackson, a Florida man, has been carrying out the bizarre schemes in the hope of cashing in on the freebies, or winning himself a job in luxurious hotels, according to court documents. Jackson is being sued by Oprah's TV network as well as Love - the college basketball star who went on to be the President's personal assistant. 'Con man': Justin Jackson, right, has been accused of pretending to be a host of celebrity-linked characters in order to score freebies and jobs. Angel Agarrat, left, is also named in a Florida lawsuit attempting to get the pair to stop posing as other people . Legal papers filed in a south Florida federal court describe Jackson waging an eight-year trail of deceit in which he variously posed as Oprah herself, Oprah's nephew, Love, an executive at the Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN), and managers of Madonna and Johnny Depp. The earliest fraud, the papers said, saw Jackson trick a New York City jeweler into lending him items worth $2.4million by pretending to be Madonna's manager. He contacted a store in July 2007 and said she needed the lavish items for a photoshoot, the papers said. When he got the items, he reportedly sold them to another jeweler and fled. The court papers say he was convicted for grand theft over the ruse, but later dreamed up new celebrity-linked schemes. The latest claims say Jackson pretended to be Oprah and her representatives in the hope of getting more freebies - and even posed as the famous talk show host to recommend him for jobs. He allegedly sent letters on forged OWN stationery to  five different hotel groups with locations in Florida, recommending himself for work at the locations. 'Impersonator': Jackson (right) is accused of sending messages purporting to be former Obama aide Reggie Love (left), whom he said worked for Oprah. The right-hand photograph, court papers claim, was emailed from an email account allegedly belonging to Johnny Depp's manager, asking for tickets to see Oprah . The papers claim some of the notes purportedly to be directly from Oprah, while others claimed to be from Love, who was signed off as the star's 'executive assistant and personal aide'. Also named in the claims was Angel Agarrat, whom lawyers claim was also involved in the deception, and was subject of some of the bogus letters of recommendation for jobs. In one of the exchanges, Jackson allegedly suggested that if he and Agarrat were to be given work at the hotels, Oprah would make a personal appearance there. One letter even claimed Jackson was Oprah's nephew. Love has never worked for Oprah. Other schemes allegedly saw Jackson write to four different jewelry companies, as well as a clothe retailer, to get free goods allegedly meant for Oprah. Scheme: According to the claims, Jackson signed some emails off as Oprah, left, and others as Scott Garner, an executive at the Oprah Winfrey Network . The claims date from around September 2013 to the end of 2014. The documents also say Jackson has a history of pretending to be Love, and had tried in 2010 to trade off Love's own name to get free designer clothes, handbags and Cheesecake Factory vouchers. In a final case, Jackson . OWN, Love and Scott Garner, an executive at Oprah's company whose name was used, filed a joint suit against Jackson and Agarrat this week. It accuses the two of invasion of privacy, misappropriation of names, infringing trademarks and conspiracy. The documents ask that a judge files an injunction to stop the two using any of the false names, and also stakes a claim for financial damages. Although no figures are specified, arguments in the court papers imply that the figure will be at least $75,000.","Justin Jackson allegedly pretended to be celebrity-linked characters .

"Liam Plunkett has set his sights on the West Indies batting line-up and is ready to 'rough them up' with pace. The 29-year-old England seamer is back in Test contention in the Caribbean after his comeback last summer was cut short by injury. He managed 18 wickets in four Tests prior to that, playing a big part for an England side often criticised for going easy on the speed gun. Liam Plunkett wants to use his pace to lead England to victory in the Test series against West Indies . Plunkett returned to the England fold last summer in Test series against Sri Lanka and India . Plunkett has recovered from a minor ankle complaint in Yorkshire's pre-season trip to Abu Dhabi . A minor ankle complaint during Yorkshire's pre-season trip to Abu Dhabi proved to be nothing more than a brief setback and he is now looking to make a name for himself in a part of the world that is famous for its quick men. 'I'm trying to be the fastest (bowler on the pitch). I train hard at it and I feel that's why I stand out from the rest,' he said ahead of Monday's two-day warm-up against a St Kitts & Nevis Invitation XI. 'I feel like I'm adaptable but you might need those little patches in the game - where it's a bit dead and there's good batters - to try and rough them up a bit. 'That's why I'm in the team, because I do bowl fast. 'I'm not a bowler who runs up and just hits line and length all day, I want to do something, I want to ruffle batsmen up. If that's what I'm asked to do, I'm happy to do that.' With James Anderson and Stuart Broad likely to retain new ball duties for the first Test in Antigua on April 13, Plunkett is fighting for a place with Barbados-born Chris Jordan and the uncapped Mark Wood. There is a case to be made for both his rivals, Jordan being more familiar with conditions in his homeland and Wood an unknown quantity to the opposition, but Plunkett relishes the scrap. 'It's a good unit, a good bunch of lads and we're all working hard. There's massive competition,' he said. 'It's up to me to bowl well in practice and in the warm-up games and get the chance to play in the first Test. 'You don't want to just get in easily. You want to feel like you've earned your place and outbowled the other guys. You want to be the best bowler. 'Last summer I felt the best I had in my career, I felt good with the ball, I felt confident. Plunkett is fighting for a start in the England Test side with Chris Jordan and Mark Wood . Plunkett (second left) could feature in a warm-up game for England that begins on Monday . 'I felt I was in a situation where I could win games for England. It didn't quite happen but I bowled nicely. 'Then I got the injury, went away this winter with the Lions and I feel good again. I got some wickets and some good rhythm so it would be good to play that first Test.'

"Freddo Frog has shrunk from 15g to 12g . Cadbury is cutting the size of its beloved Freddo Frogs by 20 per cent but keeping the recommend retail price the same. The miniature chocolate amphibians, which weighed a plump 20g two years ago - before they dropped to 15g, will now weigh just 12g. The shrinking of one of Australia’s most popular children’s chocolates was not widely announced but was in fact spotted by a shop owner who stocks the treats, the Herald Sun reports. Cadbury’s spokesman Julian Polachek said: ‘We’re making a change to the size of the product because of manufacturing cost increases that we can no longer absorb.’ The Freddo’s downsize is just the latest product to feel the pinch in the declining confectionery world. In February, chocolate lovers expressed their anger after Cadbury announced plans to reduce the size of their family blocks by ‘one row’ in a cost cutting deal. The best-selling blocks dropped from 220 grams to 200 grams. The Australasia managing director for Mondelez International, Cadbury’s parent company, Amanda Banfield told the Financial Review: ‘Clearly any chocolate lover is going to be a bit disappointed.’ Anticipating a backlash, Ms Banfield explained the company had decided the shrink the family block because of ‘unprecedented cost headwinds’. She blamed the increased price of ingredients and rising packaging costs for the change. Cadbury still recommends the blocks are sold for $4.99 – a price which won’t increase or decrease – but Ms Banfield highlighted that shops set the prices that they choose to sell the products at in store. Cadbury's parent company’s profit before tax rose 46 per cent from $87 million to $127 million in 2013. Thousands of angry chocolate fans complained about the change on Cadbury’s Facebook page. Creator of the Freddo Frog, Harry Melbourne, who thought up the idea of the chocolate frog named Freddo when he was an 18-year-old. He died aged 94 in 2007 . Cadbury have reduced the size of their family block of Dairy Milk by one row of chocolate . Tony Abbott carefully pours chocolate into a mould during a visit to the Cadbury chocolate factory in Hobart . Rebecca Isaako wrote: ‘You turned a $127 million dollar profit last financial year. This is complete & utter baloney!’ Kyria Economidis said: ‘What do you take us for? You guys are thieves, you want to cut it down and charge us the same? You are plain greedy.’ ‘Good bye Cadbury it has been a fun ride, but when you make it not worth it and unaffordable and then lie pffft not worth wasting my money how much would it cost to change the size of the chocolate with new moulds smaller packaging lots of money I would assume. I'll just wait for the tim tams to go on sale,’ Kirsty Logan commented. Nestle has sliced its Killer Python lolly in half in a bid to help Australians better manage their health . Cadbury chocolate produced for the Australian market is made in Claremont in Tasmania. A statement on the company’s website read: ‘Confectionery companies around the world are feeling the squeeze of increasing costs. At Cadbury, we’re feeling it too. We’ve reached a point where we can no longer absorb these increasing costs into the price of our chocolate blocks.’ In October last year, Cadbury rival Nestle sliced its Killer Python lolly in half in an apparent bid to help Australians better manage their health. The new 'treat size' Allen's Killer Python measures 21cm instead of 32.5cm and weighs 24g instead of 47g. Nestle has also reduced the size of Smarties 'fun size' boxes from 20g to 16g. The move is part of Nestle's efforts to help Australians improve their health by controlling the amount of food they eat - 'especially treats'. The company said the Killer Pythons still have the same 'recipe, taste and stretchiness' but the new size cuts the lolly's kilojoules from 630 to 336, meaning a 10-year-old can run it off in 30 minutes instead of one hour. Customers have expressed their outrage over the move but Nestle's General Manager of Confectionery, Martin Brown, said it was the 'right thing to do'. Nestle has also reduced the size of Smarties 'fun size' boxes from 20g to 16g . The new 'treat size' Allen's Killer Python measures 21cm instead of 32.5cm . 'I think lollies are just such a fun part of growing up and people have got a lot of passion for them, I really understand that, l used to love eating Killer Pythons as a kid,' Mr Brown told Daily Mail Australia. 'I can understand why there will be some disappointed Python fans, it's a short term sacrifice because it will upset customers and we'll sell less Pythons but it's the right thing to do for ongoing trust. 'This is a really important initiative for a product primarily eaten by kids, getting it at the right portion.' When Red Rock Deli chips dropped 20 grams from their packets the prize remained the same . The company said the new treat size Killer Pythons bags are the same price as the old ones, but have gone up in weight, so customers will be getting more lolly snakes in smaller portion sizes. The recommended retail price on individual Killer Pythons will be halved from $1 to 50 cents. In the past manufacturers have been called out for slashing product sizes while keeping the same packing and price. Red Rock Deli-Style potato chips were shrunk by 20 grams. And Choice spotted Oat Crisp Honey cereal packets were reduced by 14 per cent while maintaining similar packaging and that the price per 100 grams increased by 10 per cent.","Cadbury's Freddo Frogs have decreased from 15g to 12g .

"Forget dogs' dinners, stylish cook Gizzi Erskine's fussy feline loves poppadoms, tortilla chips and taramasalata. In an interview with Puss Puss magazine, the stylish cook, 35,  posed at a feast fit for only the classiest cat, that included bowls brimming with caviar and salmon roe, jellied fish heads, a seafood sculpture made of octopus, lobster and prawns. Although the lavish feast was in fact a set (created by food stylist Iain Graham), the cat fancier admitted that her British shorthair, Kimchi, has such a discerning palate he loves crunchy 'human food'  and that taramasalata would be his 'death row dish'. Draped in peach silk and surrounded by cat delicacies, TV chef Gizzi Erskine appears with her pet Kimchi in cat magazine, Puss Puss . The TV chef seen baring her back tattoo with pet cat Kimchi says: 'I’d love a really small cat tattoo either behind my ear or somewhere discreet' In the shoot for the publication that pitches itself as a Vogue for cat lovers, the east London-based cook told writer Gemma Lacey: 'She won’t eat anything unless it’s proper meat.' Adding that Kimchi, 'loves human food and will steal it off our plate if we’re not looking. 'She loves anything crunchy, so if there are poppadoms or tortilla chips around that’s it. I don’t like her having it as they’re not supposed to, but she just takes it. But Gizzi insists that living in a foodie household isn't to blame. 'It’s not my influence at all, she’s just a pig!'

When I make taramasalata she’ll eat and eat and eat it, it’s her death row dish. 'She loves cheese, caviar and anything really fishy.' But Kimchi occasionally indulges in cat food and is 'obsessed' with Dreamies cat biscuits. 'It’s insane,' says Gizzi. 'She purrs as she eats and she doesn’t do that normally.' Gizzi also recently added a new addition to her cat family, Ponzu, named after her favourite Japanese dressing. 'I was also thinking about calling him Neeps or Haggis as he’s Scottish, but it didn’t suit him, so eventually I just went with what suited him best. He was nameless for a week,' she says. 'Kimchi is called Kimchi because of my love of Korean food,' she adds. The new addition to the Erskine feline family is also a food lover - and has even more unusual tastes.

"A group of U.S. senators has written to football's world governing body FIFA, calling for Russia to be removed as host of the 2018 World Cup because of its role in the Ukraine crisis and occupation of Crimea. In a letter dated Tuesday and released on Wednesday, the 13 Democratic and Republican U.S. lawmakers said they 'strongly encourage' FIFA to move the global competition. 'Allowing Russia to host the World Cup inappropriately bolsters the prestige of the (Russian President Vladimir) Putin regime at a time when it should be condemned and provides economic relief at a time when much of the international community is imposing economic sanctions,' the senators wrote to FIFA President Sepp Blatter.

"A Spanish town on the Camino de Santiago pilgrimage route is warning pilgrims and other visitors to stop defecating along the famous path. Graphic signs telling visitors not to stop for a poo break during their walk to the holy city of Santiago de Compostela, in north-western Spain, have been erected in the municipality of Lastres. But no one knows who put up the signs, which show a squatting figure defecating within a red circle with a diagonal line across it. Someone in the municipality of Lastres has posted signs warning pilgrims not to defecate on the trail . The pilgrimage, known as the Way of St James, attracts thousands of pilgrims every year, but there can be very few places to go when nature calls. In Lastres, angry residents have complained about pilgrims defecating outside their homes. The signs are posted next to warnings that urge people not to litter. The pilgrimage begins at various points, with the longest route nearly 500 miles from the Spain-France border, which lead to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, where Saint James the Great is said to be buried. Antonio Fernandez, a resident of Lastres, told Spain’s EFE news agency that the signs are found to be so amusing they have become an attraction. Some pilgrims will walk nearly 500 miles (800 kilometres) to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela . Pilgrims and other visitors are now stopping to pose for photos with them, he added. Two other residents, Jose Ramon Fernandez and his wife, Maria Paz, said they were surprised the warning signs were posted, as the pilgrims ‘are very polite’ and ‘always friendly’. Lantres is a parish in Santos, and its mayor said ‘it makes no sense’ that there are no public facilities for pilgrims at regular points during their long journey on the historic route. Julio Gallego told the Spanish newspaper La Voz de Galicia that it is a ‘huge failure’ that needs to be remedied.","No one knows who put up the signs in the municipality of Lastres .

And anyone really desperate can always stop off at the Costa Express in between. The latest Costa will open on the site of the former Dedworth Road HSBC branch, the last bank in the area before it closed last year amid protests. Less than 500 yards away is a Costa which replaced a cycle shop earlier this year. It means there will be two Costas just a brisk five-minute walk apart, plus the Costa Express at a petrol station between them. One resident, Samantha Taylor, wrote online: 'I think it's mad and I wish our local councils could see that we are drowning in fast food and coffee shops in Windsor.' However, Matt Gordon-Smith said: 'The important point here is that this is in Dedworth which formerly wouldn't have had such businesses coming here. 'Surely places like Costa coming in rather than another fast-food shop or betting shop - there will soon be three within a mile - is that a sign that this part of Windsor is on the up?'

They were both in the Barça team that started the 1996-97 season by winning the Spanish Super Cup against Atletico Madrid 6-4 on aggregate. With Robson in charge and Mourinho’s assisting him the team that won the first silverware of the new season included not just the French World Cup winner and the 62-times Spain international and the aforementioned Lopetegui and Guardiola but Albert Ferrer, who started the season as Cordoba coach; Abelardo Fernandez, who is now coaching Sporting Gijon in Spain’s second tier; and Sergi Barjuan, who has just taken over at Almeria.

"A young mother and her three children have been found murdered in their home. LaTasha Gosling, 27, of Tisdale, Saskatchewan, and her two daughters, Janyaa, 4, and Jenika, 8, and her son Landen, 7, were discovered early Wednesday one day after they were reported missing. The suspect in the case was found just hours later dead, and while police would not say how he died they did say that it was not a homicide. He also had a six-month-old baby with him who was unharmed. LaTasha Gosling, 27,  and her two daughters, Janyaa, 4, and Jenika, 8, and her son Landen, 7, (above) were discovered early Wednesday . They had been murdered at their home in Tisdale, Saskatchewan (above) 'Very, very devastating finding out my sister and the kids are actually really dead and they're not coming back,' Laura Gross, the victim's sister, told CBC News. 'That's been very, very difficult for me.' Police have yet to release much information at this time, only saying that the suspect and victim did know one another. A woman who lives in the same mobile park as the family said that a man lived with the mother and three children, and described them as a 'hard working, young family.' She added; 'They were very quiet and I had no problems with them at all.' Family of the Goslings are now trying to raise money for their funeral services, and have started a GoFundMe page. 'With the public's help we hope to get nice caskets, headstones and any other cost that may arise,' reads the page. 'Any little bit helps and will be more appreciated than you could ever imagine.' They have already exceeded their initial goal of $5,000. A memorial has also been set up outside the family's home.","LaTasha Gosling, 27, of Tisdale, Saskatchewan, was found murdered in her home early Wednesday .

"A selection of thirsty animals were captured drinking water in their own unique way – and the results are hilarious. Elad Hershkowitz, a zookeeper at the Zoological Center in Tel Aviv, placed a GoPro camera at the bottom of water troughs to capture the different perspectives. The animals – ranging from a rhino who almost kisses the surface of the water to a lemur who delicately licks it – were recorded for a total of 30 hours. Zookeeper Elad Hershkowitz, of the Zoological Center in Tel Aviv, filmed animals drinking on a GoPro camera . He placed the camera in the animals' water troughs and filmed them  for a total of 30 hours . The 26-year-old then cut the final footage down to four minutes. He said: ‘Capturing this footage was really special. It offers a completely unique perspective to anything I’ve ever seen before. ‘I had the idea whilst walking around the enclosures and I saw the zebras drinking. ‘It made me curious to see what was going on below so I decided to check how the rest of the animals drink. Hershkowitz said some of the animals were initially sceptical about the foreign object in their troughs . A commanding rhino appears to almost kiss the surface of the water after it purses its lips and takes a drink . ‘There is a massive difference in how each animal drinks. Carnivores, like lions, drink a lot like domesticated cats and dogs. Herbivores like the rhinos and zebras suck up the water with their lips.’ According to Mr Hershkowitz, some of the animals were initially sceptical about the foreign object placed at the bottom of their trough. He said they attempted to check them out by putting their hooves and paws into the water first before going to take a drink. Eventually however, they got used to the camera’s presence and drank freely. A lemur is featured in the four minute footage and delicately licks the surface of the water with its tongue . A herd of zebra humorously bare their teeth while gently sipping the water from their trough . The zookeeper also anticipated a range of reactions from the animals before the experiment and ensured that the camera was secure before it took place. ‘I was really worried the lions would bite off the GoPro, so I placed a sheet of acrylic glass above the camera,’ he said. In the clip the lion can be seen aggressively breaking the surface of the water with its tongue, and is in complete contrast to a herd of zebra, who humorously bare their teeth while gently sipping.","A zookeeper at the Zoological Center in Tel Aviv recorded the footage .

"A couple who chose to forsake their dream wedding in order to pay for one final shot at IVF are celebrating giving birth to twins and even found a way to say their 'I do's' Becca Litchfield, 29, and partner Dale, 30, from Gotham, Nottingham, were heart-broken when they discovered their savings would only be enough to cover the cost of a wedding, or fertility treatment. Desperate for a family, the couple chose to sacrifice their dream wedding and go ahead with IVF, but were over the moon when weeks later they became winners of a wedding competition. Becca and Dale Litchfield decided to give up their dream wedding in order to have one last shot at IVF and have since welcomed twins,  Darci-Mai (left) and  Stanley (right) The happy couple said their vows, and were overjoyed when they discovered the fertility treatment had worked - and Becca gave birth to twins Stanley and Darci-Mai. The full-time mother says that the couple can't believe their luck having achieved both of their dreams. 'When we realised we'd couldn't have children and get married, it was heart breaking,' she said. 'It was devastating to give up one of our dreams. We knew that we weren't getting any younger so the best option was to try IVF one last time, and sacrifice the wedding. 'It was a risk, because the IVF could have failed - and we'd have ended up with neither. 'But when we won the wedding competition, and then found out I was pregnant, it was unbelievable. Although they had given up on the idea of their perfect wedding the couple were blessed with yet another stroke of luck when they won a wedding contest which allowed them to finally get married . Before they conceived Darci-Mai (right) and Stanley (left) Becca and Dale had attempted two rounds of IVF . 'Now I've got my dream - the perfect husband and children, I couldn't be happier.' Becca and Dale, first started IVF treatment in 2012 after a year of failing to conceive naturally. The couple spent £5,500 on two rounds of IVF, keeping back an additional sum of money that they planned to spend on their wedding day. But after two failed attempts, Becca and Dale were forced to make a decision, Becca says that it was an incredibly difficult one to make. 'We were spending all of our money on IVF treatment hoping we'd conceive but after we failed twice I wondered if I'd ever get pregnant,' she said. 'We planned to use the spare money to get married but knew because of our ages we'd have to have kids now or never. 'I'd always dreamt of feeling my baby kick for the first time and the bond after giving birth, so I knew we had to try IVF one last time.' After winning the wedding competition the couple were able to have the white wedding they had always wanted . Becca, pictured with Darci-Mai (left) and Stanley (right) In order to conceive, Becca, pictured with Darci-Mai, had to take three hormone injections a day but she says it was entirely worth it . After abandoning hopes of a big celebration the couple decided to at least secure their relationship with a proposal. 'We were advised to wait for a year before trying again - I was just counting down the days,' she said. 'It felt like time was ticking away so quickly. At the end of the year, Dale and I officially became engaged - it was a way to lift our spirits and we thought if we couldn't have a big wedding, we could at least get engaged.' But unbeknownst to Becca, during their year long wait for IVF, Dale, who works as an electrician, entered the pair into a win a wedding competition. Becca says that once again fate was in their favour having initially been runners-up. Becca says that she and Dale couldn't stop beaming when they discovered they were expecting twins . 'We actually came second in the competition, but then the first place dropped out and so we won,' she said. 'We couldn't believe it - after all the heart ache and the decision making, we were getting both. 'It felt like a miracle. I'd always dreamt of a big white wedding and walking down the aisle, but I'd put that to the back of my mind. 'I couldn't believe my dreams were going to become a reality.' After the wedding, the pair changed fertility clinics and had their final round of IVF. It was here that medics discovered Becca had low hormone levels and started to treat her for the problem, giving her three hormone injections a day to increase the chance of her falling pregnant . When Becca first discovered she was pregnant she was so shocked she took four tests to make sure. She gave birth to twins Darci-Mai (left) and Stanley (right) Becca says that it was a challenging period but she was prepared to carry on in hope of having her dream family. 'I felt like a pin cushion while I was having all the treatment but knew it was worth it. 'Then after the eggs were implanted I took two weeks off work to relax and do nothing other than sit with my legs up in the hope it would help us to get pregnant. 'Then we did a pregnancy test and it was positive. We didn't want to get our hopes up but after four more tests said we were pregnant I believed it.' Overjoyed with the news Becca was then astounded to find out that she was not carrying just one baby but two. 'Once I knew I was pregnant I had a feeling we were going to have twins and when doctors confirmed it we couldn't believe it. 'When the doctor told me there were two heartbeats we were all gobsmacked. The twins were born on 27th September last year . Becca says that even when the Darci-Mai (left) and Stanley (right) are screaming she feels lucky to have them . 'Me and Dale sat beaming at each other, we couldn't believe we were about to have one baby let alone twins.' The twins were born in September last year and six months later the couple still can't quite believe their luck. Becca said: 'It's amazing to think how dramatically our life changed in one year - we got married and now have a beautiful boy and girl. 'Even now I still feel so privileged to have children - even when they are screaming I keep thinking thank goodness that they are with us. 'Before I thought of myself as very unlucky, I'd never won anything in my life. 'But since winning our wedding and having kids it still doesn't feel real. 'I've definitely used my life's worth of luck now but I don't care because I've got everything I ever dreamed of so I'm happy. 'Finally everything's gone right, we are finally married parents after everything we've been through it is incredible.'","Becca and Dale Litchfield spent their wedding savings on IVF .

"Just a quarter of voters think David Cameron is hungriest to win the election, a poll reveals today as the Prime Minister tries to step up his campaign passion. After criticism of a dull campaign from the chillaxing PM, Mr Cameron used an interview to insist he was working 'bloody hard' to secure a majority. But only 25 per cent of people think he wants to win most, compared to 43 per cent who believe Ed Miliband is most up for the fight. Scroll down for video . Some 43 per cent of voters think Ed Miliband 'comes across as wanting to win the most' when compared to David Cameron . Opinion polls continue to suggest the result is too close to call, although two surveys yesterday put the Tories ahead, including one which gave them a six-point lead. But while Mr Cameron is frequently seen as the strongest leader when compared to Mr Miliband, voters appear to think he wants to win less. In a YouGov survey for The Times, 43 per cent of voters think Mr Miliband 'comes across as wanting to win the most' when compared to Mr Cameron. Only 25 per cent thought Mr Cameron was hungriest for the job, and 13 per cent said neither of them. Mr Cameron appeared without a tie or jacket again today at Kelvin Hughes in north London as part of a 'sleeves rolled up' strategy designed to show he is fighting hard for a Tory victory. Meanwhile, Mr Miliband is giving a speech on how a Labour government would tackle immigration. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, riding high after strong TV debate performances and a surge in the polls, was judged to be enjoying the fight more than anyone by 34 per cent of voters . Just 7 per cent also thought Mr Cameron was enjoying the campaign the most out of all the main party leaders. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, riding high after strong TV debate performances and a surge in the polls, was judged to be enjoying the fight more than anyone by 34 per cent of voters. Ukip's Nigel Farage was the second happiest leader on 16 per cent, followed by Mr Miliband on 13 per cent. In recent days senior Tories and business backers had begun to criticise the campaign, warning it was dull and suffering from a 'curious lack of energy and belief'. Former Prime Minister Sir John Major warned against relying on dry economic data, when people want to know how their lives will be better. David Cameron appeared without a tie or jacket again today at Kelvin Hughes in north London as part of a 'sleeves rolled up' strategy designed to show he is fighting hard for a Tory victory . More people think Ed Miliband is hungriest for a win and appears to be enjoying the campaign more than his Tory rival . Mr Cameron appears to have taken the criticism to heart, making a series of passionate stump speeches in the last 72 hours. After weeks of criticism that the Conservatives were running a boring campaign, the Prime Minister found the fire in his belly as he declared in London yesterday: 'If I'm getting lively about it it's because I feel bloody lively about it.' In an interview with The Times today he adds: 'The real David Cameron has been standing up and working bloody hard for the last five years. 'I'm feeling pumped up. There's ten days to go, it's a bloody important election and I'm determined to get across the line. The line is victory — and victory is a Conservative majority.

"France's biggest handball star Nikola Karabatic will stand trial for fraud over his suspected involvement in an illegal betting case. Karabatic, a multiple world and Olympic gold medalist, and his younger brother Luka were among a group of players banned by the French league two years ago for betting on the result of a match in which their Montpellier club, which had already secured the title, lost to a struggling team. Karabatic's lawyer Michael Corbier told Sportsmail on Wednesday the trial will likely take place within months. French handball star Nikola Karabatic has been accused of match fixing along with 15 others . Former Montpellier ace competes for France in Handball World Cup match against Iceland in January . 'We would have preferred the charges to be thrown out, but we'll aim for a not-guilty verdict,' said Corbier. 'In theory he is facing five years in prison and a fine, but even a suspended sentence of just half an hour in jail would be too much.' Karabatic, who was briefly detained when the case emerged, now plays for Barcelona in the Spanish league. Karabatic leaves the Montpellier's courtroom after attending his appeal in October 2012 . Other former or current Montpellier players including Mladen Bojinovic, Samuel Honrubia, Dragan Gagic, Primoz Prost, Issam Tej and Mickael Robin will also be tried. Karabatic has denied placing bets on the match that Montpellier lost 31-28 to Cesson-Rennes. Betting authority Francaise de Jeux reported an unusually high increase in betting at halftime in the match, raising suspicions and triggering a police investigation.

"Kicked out: Elizabeth Sedway, 51, says Alaska Airlines had her ejected from a flight because she has cancer and lacked a doctor's note clearing her to fly . A married mother of two battling cancer has been ejected from an Alaska Airlines flight from Hawaii to California along with her family because she lacked a doctor's note clearing her to fly. Elizabeth Sedway, 51, from Granite Hill, California, posted an emotional video on her Facebook page Monday showing her family being kicked off a packed plane. Mrs Sedway, who suffers from multiple myeloma - a rare form of plasma cancer - detailed her ordeal in a status update accompanying the short video, which has been shared nearly 10,000 times as of Tuesday evening. In the message, the mother of two explained that she was sitting in the handicapped section of a boarding area at Lihue Airport on Kauai when an Alaska Airlines representative noticed she had put on a surgical mask to shield herself from germs and came up to her asking if she needed anything. Mrs Sedway initially said she was fine, but when the airline employee approached her a second time, she indicated that she might require a little extra time to board the plane because she sometimes felt 'weak.' Homeward bound: The married mother of three, her husband (right) and their two sons were returning home to California Monday after vacationing in Hawaii when they were kicked off the flight . Caught on camera: Sedway posted an emotional video on her Facebook page Monday showing her family being kicked off a packed plane . In Sedway's video, her husband is seen removing their carry-on luggage and helping their sons out of their seats . Brought to tears: As the family of four walk towards the exit, Elizabeth Sedway breaks down and tearfully apologizes for holding everyone up . The Sedway family eventually boarded the plane and were awaiting takeoff in their seats when an airline representative came on board and announced that the cancer-stricken passenger could not fly without a note from her doctor. In Sedway's video, her husband dressed in a brightly colored Hawaiian shirt is seen removing their carry-on luggage and helping their sons out of their seats while his wife narrates their removal from the flight. 'All these people are waiting, and I am being removed as if I'm a criminal or contagious because I have cancer,' she says. 'My family is being forcibly removed from an airplane because I have cancer and no note to fly.' As the family of four walk towards the exit, Elizabeth Sedway breaks down and tearfully apologizes for holding everyone up. One of the passengers tells the woman, 'God bless you.' In an interview with NBC Bay Area, Elizabeth Sedway said the airline was concerned she might collapse during the eight-hour flight to San Jose, California. After being asked to leave the plane, Mrs Sedway emailed her oncologist in California and he gave her the green light to fly, but she told the local NBC affiliate in a phone interview that the airline was not satisfied and refused to let her re-board. Named and shamed: Sedway shared this photo of Alaska Airline staff at Lihue Airport on her Facebook page, identifying them as the employees whom she had to deal with during the incident . Damage control: Alaska Airlines later apologized to the family for mishandling the situation . The Sedways spent Monday night in a hotel in Maui, for which they were forced to pay out of pocket, and they were scheduled to return home on a Hawaiian Airlines flight Tuesday evening. Elizabeth Sedway lamented on her Facebook page that because of the delay caused by Alaska Airlines, she will miss two chemotherapy sessions, her husband will miss important meetings and her sons will miss school. Earlier today, a spokesperson for Alaska Airlines told CBS San Francisco that the company apologized to Elizabeth Sedway for the inconvenience and for the way its employees handled the situation. ‘Her family’s tickets have been refunded and we will cover the cost of her family’s overnight accommodations in Lihue,’ Alaska spokeswoman Halley Knigge stated. ‘While our employee had the customer’s well-being in mind, the situation could have been handled differently.’","Elizabeth Sedway, 51, has rare plasma cancer and was returning to California with her husband and two children from Hawaii vacation .

"From 'here's you a piece of pizza' to 'this glass needs washed', every state has its own set of phrases that can seem bizarre to the rest of the English-speaking world. In New York, for instance, there's a tendency to use the word 'so' for drama, such as 'I'm so totally over this.' Some people in San Jose think nothing of saying 'didn't nobody help him', while Florida residents can be heard using the phrase, 'I ain't never had no trouble with none of 'em.' Click on a location marker in the map below to hear common phrases for each state . All of my clothes needs washed - Idaho . ..and wadn't anybody home but me - Alabama . Don’t none of y’all work as hard as I do - Virginia . We all use night-crawlers anymore - Iowa . I so might run this [race] with you - California . I ain't never had no trouble with none of 'em - Florida . You are so in the Doghouse for that on - New York . Twitter can be a professional job anymore - Nebraska . Now researchers at Yale University have revealed these patterns by documenting the subtle differences in sentence structure across the US. Their interactive map allows you to click on a location and see common phrases for a region, as well as its source. While the map focuses on the US, it also has a small amount of data for the UK, with sentences such as 'yer lugs needs washed' used in Scotland and 'Ne mon nule don hum no good', in Aylesbury. 'Unlike variation in phonology (often referred to as accent) and in the lexicon (different words), variation in grammatical systems within English has for the most part not been systematically investigated,' says Larry Horn, professor of linguistics and philosophy at Yale University. 'This variation may be found among speakers who live in a certain geographical region, or who belong to a certain age group, or to a particular social or ethnic group,' he adds. During the past year, members of the project have been conducting nationwide surveys using an online crowdsourcing platform asking for people's judgment on sentences. The researchers were not interested in what is considered to be correct  grammar, but in what people do naturally. As well as the map, the team has also created a comprehensive guide that lists the different types of sentence structures used. One of the most interesting discoveries  are presentative sentences like 'Here's you a water bottle.' 'That sentence just floored me,' says postdoctoral associate Jim Wood, a Yale University lecturer in linguistics. 'It seemed very alien and different to me.' The overall pattern was clear; In the South people found that sentence to be completely normal, while in the North, it was almost unheard of. From 'here's you a piece of pizza' to 'this glass needs washed', every state has its own phrases that can seem odd to the rest of the world . 'It's a reason didn't nobody help him', is a common sentence structure used in San Jose, claims the study authors at Yale University . While the map focuses on the US, it also has a small amount of data for the UK, with sentences such as 'yer lugs needs washed' used in Scotland (left) and 'Ne mon nule don hum no good', in Aylesbury. And New York isn't the only region that uses 'so' to add emphasis to a sentence. Londoners also appear to have picked up the habit (right) 'It was pretty stunning, and it turns out you can do it with ""where"" as well. ""Where's me a screwdriver?"" or ""Where's me a place to eat around here?""' he added. Other notable examples include ‘Don’t none of y’all work as hard as I do’ in Virginia; ‘we all use night-crawlers anymore’ in Iowa; and ‘I ain't never had no trouble with none of 'em’ in Florida. Meanwhile, people in New Haven sometimes use 'so don't I', such as in the sentence, 'he plays guitar, but so don't I'. Linguistics Professor Raffaella Zanuttini explained that there is also a social implication to this research. 'Often people are convinced that there is a right way of speaking a language and a wrong way of speaking that language. 'From the point of view of a linguist, that is really off the mark for many reasons,' she says. 'We linguists can see through this, because we have a more scientific approach to language,' says Zanuttini. 'We believe that creating an awareness of what we consider to be basic facts about language can have a positive social effect, by making people aware that they are expressing a negative evaluation of others.'

"Labour received more than £1 every second from trades unions in the second week of the election campaign, official figures revealed this morning. Union barons gave more than £700,000 to Ed Miliband’s party, swelling Labour’s election war chest for the last 14 days of the campaign. Overall, Labour received £1.1million in donations between April 6 and April 12 – more than twice as much as the Conservative party which received just £492,512. Union barons gave more than £700,000 to Labour in the second week of the election campaign in a boost to Ed Miliband, pictured today speaking to supporters in Leicester . Unison general secretary Dave Prentis (left) and the Unite chief Len McCluskey (right) have boosted Labour's election campaign with donations worth more than £400,000 between them . Most of the Tory cash came from wealthy individuals, who handed over £460,000. Christopher Rokos, who was a co-founder of hedge fund Brevan Howard Asset Management, donated £170,000 - the largest single amount in the period - to the Tories. The Liberal Democrats, meanwhile, were given just £50,000 and Ukip £8,000, according to figures from the Electoral Commission. Most of the Lib Dem cash came from the Green energy company Ecotricity, founded by Dale Vince, provided £30,000 to the Lib Dems. Labour received 14 times more in union donations than the Lib Dems total cash gifts combined. Unison handed over £311,875, USDAW £300,480 and Len McCluskey’s Unite a further £112,000.

Nick Clegg, pictured in Talgarth, Brecon, Wales today, received just £50,000 over seven days - while Ukip took just £8,000, according to figures from the Electoral Commission . MP Bob Neill said: ‘Ed Miliband has taken another hefty wedge of cash from the union barons, which comes with strings attached. ‘More spending, more borrowing, higher taxes and a bigger welfare bill- all demands that he will bow to in exchange for their financial support. ‘Ed Miliband wants to sneak into Downing Street by the back door- funded by Len McCluskey’s union cash and propped up by Nicola Sturgeon’s SNP. They will call the tune and the British people will pay the price.’ By law, political parties must submit weekly donation and loan reports to the commission if they are standing candidates in the UK parliamentary election and they have received any donations or loans over £7,500. Parties must notify the commission if they are not standing candidates in order to be exempt from weekly reporting.","Union barons gave more than £700,000 to Ed Miliband’s party in a week .

"Brendan Rodgers will remind Raheem Sterling of his responsibilities after the Liverpool youngster hit the headlines for the wrong reasons before scoring the opener in a 2-0 win over Newcastle United. Sterling, who is unwilling to sign a new contract at Anfield, has been videoed passing out after allegedly inhaling nitrous oxide, also known as 'hippy crack', and on Sunday was pictured puffing on a shisha pipe. The 20-year-old faces a club investigation and potential disciplinary action over his behaviour, and Liverpool manager Rodgers now says he will take time to talk to his rising star about what being a professional entails. Brendan Rodgers will remind Raheem Sterling of his responsibilities after his recent controversies . Liverpool forward  Sterling can be seen pictured on social media whilst smoking a shisha pipe . Rodgers said that Sterling's behaviour would be dealt with internally and that he would be speaking to him . When asked whether he would speak with Sterling, whose opener was followed up by Joe Allen's goal in the 2-0 win at Anfield, Rodgers said: 'I will do. 'I think it’s one where internally we’re always looking into these types of items. 'He’s a young kid that’s been in the spotlight now so he knows the demands of being a top class player and a top class professional, it’s not just on the field it’s off the field but I will speak with him on it and we’ll move on.' An excellent piece of skill from Sterling inside the Newcastle penalty area opened up the chance for him in the ninth minute on Monday night, and the England international expertly curled past goalkeeper Tim Krul to make it 1-0.

Rodgers said that lack of a second goal for Sterling would have left his player disappointed at Anfield . Sterling could have had more goals and at one point shot wide with the goal gaping. Rodgers said that lack of a second finishing touch would have left his player disappointed. 'He’s very valuable, he’s a kid that, he’s non-stop, he wants to learn and improve himself, the Anfield boss said. 'I thought he was outstanding tonight. He’ll be disappointed that he maybe didn’t get three goals this evening, second one he should slot away, but wonderful skill and ability for the first goal and he was tireless all evening pressing the ball and posing a threat.' Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher said Sterling would learn from the last six to 12 months at Liverpool . Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher said on Sky Sports: 'There’s no doubt over the last six to 12 months, in years to come he’ll look back over this period now as a massive learning curve for him. 'When you’re a 20-year-old kid, you make mistakes at that age, I did, I’m sure we all do. It’s just important that he learns from it because Raheem Sterling, for how good a footballer he is, he needs to be on the back pages, not the front pages and that’s a problem for him in these last few months.'","Raheem Sterling has been videoed allegedly inhaling nitrous oxide .

"Internet users were left scratching their heads after an old hoax video showing a wave rider surfing in front of the Sydney's Opera House started trending for a second time. The video was uploaded to Twitter on Tuesday morning by popular Sydney radio duo Fitzy and Wippa, before quickly being reposted by a spell of other sources. The posting of the video comes in the wake of heavy storms which battered Sydney overnight, with parts of the city experiencing the heaviest rainfall in 100 years. A hoax video showing a wave rider surfing in front of the Sydney's Opera House has gone viral for the second time . Some users have referenced the weather as the trigger of the strange phenomenon, with musician Fortafy uploading the video with the following caption: 'storm brings out surfers in Sydney Harbour.' The video was originally posted by Sydneysider Darren Johnson following strong storms and tandem heavy swells in June 2012. YouTube commenters were quick to point out inaccuracies in the video, such as the appearance of rocks around the Opera House and the cardboard-esque appearance of the man in the final shot. It was also rebutted by several wave experts who vowed it was a sham. Ben Macartney, a swell forecaster, told News.com 'the only way you'd get waves in there would be a giant tsunami coming out of the Pacific.'

"We all need a helping hand sometimes, and nobody more so than Kecil the baby orangutan, who had a tough start to life after his natural mother and another surrogate mother rejected him. But the one-year-old ape found love at the third time of asking with second surrogate mother Maggie at Chicago's Brookfield Zoo, and has today been pictured cuddling up to the experienced mother ahead of his first public outing this weekend. Maggie, 53, who has already raised one surrogate child, has proved herself yet again by helping to raise Kecil (pronounced Ka-cheel) for the past 10 months, and the two now have an inseparable bond. Scroll down for video . Taking care: Maggie, 53, wraps a protective arm around Kecil the baby orangutan who she has been raising for the past ten months after his mother and a surrogate mother both rejected him . Inseparable: Zookeepers were nervous that Maggie might reject Kecil after raising four of her own children and another surrogate which was given to her in 2002, but she has proved her parenting prowess once again . When the pair appeared in front of news crews earlier today, Kecil began crying after losing sight of Maggie for a few moments. But the elder orangutan quickly returned, at which point Kecil quietened down and scooted over to join her, reports the Chicago Sun Times. Kecil had to be moved from his birthplace at Toledo zoo, in Ohio, 14 months ago after his natural mother failed to bond with him properly after birth. He was moved to Milwaukee County Zoo and given to a second surrogate, but she did not form a bond with him either. In a final attempt to find a parent for Kecil, he was handed over to Maggie, the oldest orangutan in North America, who has already raised four children of her own, and a fifth surrogate which was given to her in 2002. The pair immediately showed signs of intimacy, but zookeepers still faced a tense wait to see if the elderly orangutan would take on full parental duties. Nava Greenblatt, one of the zoo’s lead primate keepers, said that the turning point came when a fire alarm sounded at the zoo a few weeks ago, frightening Kecil, who ran to Maggie and cuddle up to her. Turning point: Keepers in Chicago said the turning point for Kecil came a few weeks ago when a fire alarm went off on the zoo, frightening him. Usually he turned to people for comfort, but instead he ran and cuddled up to Maggie . Big day: After settling into his new enclosure, Kecil will go on display for the first time this weekend in two hours slots between 10am and midday, allowing him to nap in the afternoons . Getting into the swing of things: Keepers said when Kecil and Maggie were first put into their new enclosure, the older ape would wander too far ahead, and Kecil would get lost, but the pair have now learned to stick close to one another . She said: 'Initially when he would be feeling insecure he would turn to people, and then there was a shift where he would turn to Maggie if he felt insecure. That was a big milestone. He really needs her to learn how to be an orangutan.' The pair will eventually become part of an exhibit featuring the zoo's four other orangutans, but at the moment they are living in isolation, as would be the case in the wild. Kecil will be on display on Saturday and Sunday at Brookfield Zoo's Tropic World Asia enclosure between 10am and midday. The other orangutans will be allowed into the enclosure around those times to help them acclimatise as well. Hanging out: The pair will eventually become part of an exhibit featuring the zoo's four other orangutans, but at the moment they are living in isolation, as would be the case in the wild . Happy monkey: Keepers said: 'On his first day out he was wide eyed and a bit amazed. He stayed close to Maggie and whimpered if she moved too far away. We saw many joyful reunions those first few days as they separated and found one another again'","Kecil the one-year-old orangutan was taken to Chicago zoo after being rejected by his mother and surrogate mother .

"Listening to The Beatles could help to enhance the enjoyment of a fish and chip supper, psychologists have found. Research suggests that certain types of music can bring out specific flavours - including sweet, salty and bitter - in a range of foods. The intensity of Nessun Dorma, performed by Luciano Pavarotti, is said to be the perfect accompaniment to dark mouse or coffee. Meanwhile, the high-pitched piano in Billie Holiday's Autumn in New York can help emphasise the autumnal flavour of a pumpkin pudding. Listening to the right sort of music, including the Beatles (pictured) can enhance flavours in certain food and drink, researchers have found . In the Ultraviolent restaurant in Shanghai, fish and chips (pictured) are served up to a backdrop of the Beatles . In Ultraviolent restaurant in Shanghai, fish and chips are served up to a backdrop of the Beatles, while in El Celler de Can Roca in Girona, Spain, scented meringue comes with a commentary describing Barcelona footballer Lionel Messi in action, a clip which apparently brings out the citrus flavours in the dessert. The so-called digital seasoning also applies to wine, helping drinkers to enjoy their tipple by up to 15 per cent more, if served alongside the right music. Researchers found people enjoyed their wine more while listening to 'paired' music, rather than while being sat in silence. Tchaikovsky's String Quartet No 1 in D Major particularly compliments Chateau Margaux 2004, while Mozart's Flute Quartet in D Major should be played while drinking Puilly-Fume. Professor Charles Spence, a behavioral psychologist from Oxford University, told the Observer's Neil Tweedle that taste is not as dominant as we might think in judging a meal and that our ears might subconsciously talk to our tastebuds. He said: 'Music cannot create taste or flavours that are not there in your mouth, but it can draw attention to certain notes in a wine or food that are competing in your mind... It's kind of digital seasoning.' The deep tones of Luciano Pavarotti (pictured left) singing Nessun Dorma can enhance the bitterness in coffee and the intensity in a chocolate mousse (pictured right) Mr Spence added that humans tend to match the same sounds to the same tastes. He described sourness as 'high-pitched', meaning it should be played alongside music of the same quality. He also said sweetness is associated with richer sounds, while bitterness is linked to deeper tones. He believes the sound associated with salty - which he has not yet pinned down - would be enhanced by a throbbing type of sound. 'Bitter, sweet, sour - we have those,' says Professor Charles Spence, 'But salty is the hardest taste to embody in sound.' To carry out his research, Mr Spence gives people two pieces of identical chocolate and asks them to each eat one while listening to a different piece of classical music. While the more sombre music is played, people generally describe the chocolate as more bitter. When they described the chocolate as 'sweet', it generally when the more upbeat piece was being played, he said. Heston Blumenthal, who runs the Fat Duck in Bray, Berkshire, is among restaurateurs who have sought the professor's advice. Mr Spence said that, as well as music, colour and even the weight of cutlery are factors which can combine to make a dining experience more enjoyable. Ambient lighting was found to have a positive effect on a person's enjoyment, with red light bringing out the fruitiness in red wine.","Research suggests certain types of music can bring out specific flavours .

A senior official told the newspaper: 'We are a Left-wing government. If we have to choose between a default to the IMF or a default to our own people, it is a no-brainer.

"(CNN)Roseanne Barr revealed earlier this week that she is going blind. In an interview with The Daily Beast, the 62-year-old comic talked about her struggle with macular degeneration and glaucoma — two eye diseases that get progressively worse over time and can steal vision. Barr's doctors haven't provided a timeline, but her symptoms are worsening: ""My vision is closing in now,"" she said. ""I just try and enjoy vision as much as possible. Y'know, living it up."" Related: 9 worst eye care mistakes you're making . Macular degeneration is a breakdown of the part of the retina that allows us to see fine details in the center of vision; while glaucoma damages the nerve that connects the retina to the brain, and is often caused by fluid build-up and pressure in the eyes. (Barr said in the interview that she helps relieve the pressure by using marijuana, which is known to temporarily lower pressure inside the eye.) ""It's somewhat unusual that Roseanne Bar has both, but not unheard of,"" explains ophthalmologist Steven A. Shanbom, MD, of Shanbom Eye Specialists in Berkley, Mich. Though there are some controllable risk factors, certain people are genetically predisposed to these diseases, so Barr may simply be prone to both. ""Certainly it's sad. The combination of the two is terrible. Macular degeneration takes away her central vision, and glaucoma is taking away her peripheral vision,"" Dr. Shanbom adds. (He is not treating Roseanne Barr, and does not know the specifics of her case.) The risk for both diseases goes up for everyone after age 60, with some people, especially African Americans, at higher risk in their 40s. That's why the American Academy of Opthalmology recommends getting a baseline eye exam when you turn the big 4-0, even if you have perfect vision. In the early stages, you can have either condition, but have no symptoms at all. Things like a family history or high blood pressure, or issues within the eye (like having a thinner cornea, for example) might lead your MD to prescribe drops that can reduce your chances of developing glaucoma by about half. Related: 10 natural ways to lower blood pressure . There is no cure for either disease. But like those eyedrops, there are treatments that may delay the progression of early-stage glaucoma (from other drugs to surgery), and therapies that might halt further vision loss in advanced cases of macular degeneration (including an implantable telescope). The future looks brighter however: An animal study published this month suggests that an injection of stem cells into the eye might slow or even reverse the effects of early-stage macular degeneration. There are also simple things you can start doing right now to ward off these diseases. Here, five ways to protect your peepers. Slip on your shades—even when it's cloudy . Sun exposure can up the risk for glaucoma and macular degeneration, as well as cataracts (clouding of the lenses). Make sure your sunglasses offer 99% to 100% UV protection. Sporting a pair that doesn't filter UV light is more dangerous than wearing no shades at all, because the dark lenses cause your pupils to dilate and allow in more harmful rays. Schedule in a regular walk . Studies indicate that aerobic exercise can reduce the eye pressure that leads to glaucoma, and may improve blood flow to the retina and optic nerve. According to the Glaucoma Research Foundation, all you need to do is raise your pulse 20% to 25% (which could mean a brisk walk) for 20 minutes, a minimum of four times a week. Related: 9 tweaks that make walking workouts more effective . Eat your greens . Spinach, kale, and other leafy greens are packed with lutein and zeaxanthin—antioxidants that lower your risk of developing macular degeneration (and cataracts too), research shows. Another good source: egg yolks. Snack on almonds, citrus, and berries . Almonds are loaded with vitamin E (a handful provides about half your daily dose), which slows macular degeneration; while citrus fruit and berries are filled with vitamin C, which cuts your odds of developing the disease. Avoid cigarette smoke . While smoking is bad news for many parts of your body, you may not have considered eyes to be one of them. However, smoking doubles your risk of macular degeneration. Avoiding cigs can not only protect your lungs and heart, it can protect your peepers too.","Barr has macular degeneration and glaucoma, eye diseases that get progressively worse and can steal vision .

"Landlord: Despite attacking right to buy, Emily Thornberry has three homes . A senior Labour politician was under fire last night for attacking right to buy – while renting out a property she bought from a housing association. Emily Thornberry has come out against David Cameron’s pledge to extend the right to buy policy from council tenants to those in housing association homes. But eight years ago she and her husband bought at auction a housing association property now worth almost £1million. Tories said Miss Thornberry, who lost her frontbench job after tweeting a sneering picture of a house covered in England flags and with a white van outside, opposed right to buy but not ‘right to buy to let’. ‘This hypocrisy goes right to the heart of Ed Miliband’s Islington-based, out-of-touch Labour Party,’ said Henry Smith, who is seeking re-election as Conservative MP for Crawley. ‘They speak out against plans that help the aspirations of hardworking people on days when it’s politically useful.’ Housing association chiefs have also been accused of hypocrisy for drawing huge salaries and living in mansions while wishing to deny tenants a foot on the property ladder. Ruth Davison, of the National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, has a£1million home in fashionable Islington, north London. Miss Thornberry yesterday retweeted an article from the federation attacking right to buy. And, in a question-and-answer session last week, the Labour candidate for Islington South and Finsbury criticised the policy directly. She said: ‘I don’t have a problem per se with people being able to buy their council flat or council house, so long as it is replaced like for like. 'And that’s what the problem has been. There has been a massive sell-off but they have not been replaced.’ Council house tenants in England can already buy their home at a discount of up to £103,900. The Tories would extend this to 800,000 housing association tenants who now have limited purchase rights and to 500,000 who have no rights at all. Around 2.7million people live in these properties. The subsidies would be funded by making councils sell their more costly properties when they become vacant. Each would be replaced on a one-for-one basis. The picture that cost Miss Thornberry her job as shadow attorney general was taken during the Rochester by-election, which was won by Ukip. The case highlighted just how much high-value property Miss Thornberry owned. Costly tweet: Emily Thornberry lost her frontbench job after tweeting this picture, with the sneering caption 'Image from #Rochester' while on the campaign trail in Medway, Kent . She lives with her husband, high court judge Sir Christopher Nugee, in a four-storey Victorian townhouse on an exclusive crescent in Barnsbury, north London, worth almost £3million. Emily Thornberry was forced to resign from the shadow cabinet in November after sneering at a home with St George’s flags hung outside and a white van on the drive. She said she had ‘never seen anything like it’ after tweeting a photo of the terraced home while on the campaign trail for the Rochester and Strood by-election in Kent. The then-shadow attorney general, who lives in a £3million north London house, wrote mockingly alongside the photo: ‘Image from Rochester.’ At first she tried to defend her remarks but was told to quit within hours of the tweet. The home’s owner, cage fighter Dan Ware, 37, branded her a ‘snob’. Speaking at the time, leader Ed Miliband said: ‘Respect is a basic rule of politics and I’m afraid her tweet conveyed a sense of disrespect.’ Miss Thornberry also owns a £600,000 flat in Guildford, Surrey, which she bought for her mother in 2000. In March 2007, her husband bought the housing association property in Finsbury at auction for £572,000. The three-storey townhouse was bought from Ujima, a housing association catering largely for ethnic minority tenants, which went bust just months later. It is now let. The fact a housing association sells a property does not necessarily mean social housing stock has fallen. They could use the cash to build in a cheaper area. During part of her childhood, Miss Thornberry lived in a council house. At the age of seven, her parents divorced and she and her two younger brothers moved into social housing with their mother. Labour politicians continued to attack the right to buy extension yesterday. David Lammy, a potential London mayoral candidate, tweeted: ‘Extending right to buy is one of the most senseless and irresponsible pledges ever made by a British political party.’ Last night a YouGov poll for the Policy Exchange think-tank suggested 50 per cent back extended right to buy. Housing fat cat who hates right to buy is a Labour supporter with £1m home . Hypocrite? Ruth Davison, leading critic of David Cameron's plan to extent the right to buy scheme is a Labour party member and the owner of a £1million house in Islington, London . The leading critic of Conservative Party plans to give housing association tenants a right to buy herself lives in a £1million house. As director of policy and external affairs at the National Housing Federation, Ruth Davison has been leading the campaign to prevent millions of people getting a real chance of owning their own homes. But just as she did not advertise the fact that she is a member of her local Labour party in Islington, North London, neither has she revealed just how comfortable her own house is. In reality she has been one of the country’s biggest gainers from the private property boom. She also earned hefty salaries in public bodies for years when Labour was in power. Miss Davison, 44, and husband Chris Bailey, 47, who describes himself as an ‘urban regenerator, non-profit board member and social entrepreneur’, bought a large terrace house in Islington for £440,000 ten years ago. It has now rocketed to more than £1million in value. Yet on behalf of the fat-cat housing association bosses she speaks for, Miss Davison has been across the newspapers and broadcasters this week fighting to stop the Conservative election campaign proposal to extend ‘right to buy’ legislation from council house tenants to the 2.7million people living in housing association properties. Under the scheme, housing association tenants would receive discounts of tens of thousands of pounds on the market value of their homes. Miss Davison told the BBC in response to the Tory right-to-buy plans on Tuesday that it was wrong to effectively give money to ‘some of the most securely housed people in the country on some of the lowest rents’. She added: ‘We are independent organisations and charities – you can no more force a housing association to sell their assets at less than they’re worth than you can force Tesco, or even Cancer Research. So housing associations would have to be fully recompensed for any sale. There will be a cost to the taxpayer.’ Miss Davison’s first major taxpayer-funded role under Labour was at the Audit Commission, with other senior roles at Bedford and Hertfordshire Strategic Health Authority and the National Patient Safety Agency. Last night Miss Davison said: ‘The price of a family house is now beyond the reach of many – I couldn’t afford to buy my home now. ‘We need to build more homes of all types to make housing more affordable for everyone, not just give money away to the lucky few.’","Emily Thornberry has criticised Conservative 'right-to-buy' policy .

"A woman of Arab and Jewish descent who was strip-searched at a Detroit-area airport has reached a settlement in a lawsuit filed on her behalf, the American Civil Liberties Union said Tuesday. The federal government will give Shoshana Hebshi $40,000 as compensation for being humiliated on the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks after armed agents forced her from a plane at Detroit Metropolitan Airport, made her undress during a search and held her for hours. Frontier Airlines, the Transportation Security Administration and Wayne County Airport Authority were named in the federal lawsuit.

"(CNN)One war was enough for Gregory Margolin. Now 87 years old, he was a 16-year-old Jewish recruit when he fought in the Soviet Red Army. As he fought the Nazis in World War II, his family fled. ""I did not show that I was Jewish,"" Margolin says. ""But it did not matter because people were being killed left and right. All around me."" This year, in Ukraine, he found himself again surrounded by war. Margolin was a sniper who rose to be a commander in the army. His old uniform is still adorned with medals from his time in the military. His granddaughter Liora still marvels at his stories from the war. She is amazed that he managed to survive. Suffering from Alzheimer's disease, a degenerative condition that impairs memory, he struggles to remember his own life sometimes, but he remembers the horrors of war. His eyes slowly shift back and forth as he seeks the right word. Or perhaps the right memory. His hands shake ever so slightly. It seems he knows he has lived a life. He is just trying to remember all the details. ""People were hiding in shelters under the ground,"" Liora says of the stories Margolin once told. ""They were being shot at point blank range. It was terrible."" ""[The Nazis] would have erased us from the Earth,"" Margolin remembers. ""They attacked us and we fought back."" After the war, Margolin settled in Donetsk in Eastern Ukraine. His family grew. He built a life. Then, decades later, he found himself in the middle of a war once again. ""A missile fell and the house was destroyed. We were attacked,"" Margolin says. ""A missile fell. I remember."" Margolin's family lived in a neighborhood next to the Donetsk airport, near some of the most intense fighting in Eastern Ukraine as pro-Russian separatists battled the Ukrainian army. Margolin, who had survived one war, was able to survive another, even as the stray missile hit his house on February 10. It spared him, but it killed his daughter Ira. ""The moment it happened, we decided that's it. Here and now, we're moving to Israel,"" says Liora. ""This is the safest place."" Margolin arrived in Israel on March 24. Asked why the family waited to leave the war-torn region of Eastern Ukraine, Liora says they felt they would be fine in Donetsk, while Liora prayed for their safety from Israel. ""No matter how much we're afraid of the next war here and as much as it's not quiet here, it is the quietest place."" Margolin came over in a wave of Ukrainian Jewish immigration to Israel that coincided with the beginning of hostilities in Eastern Ukraine. The International Fellowship of Christians and Jews, an organization that works to build interfaith understanding and support for Israel, has brought 600 Jews to Israel since December, Margolin among them. Rabbi Yechiel Eckstein, the fellowship's founder, says, ""We set up a refugee center. It's the first time since the Holocaust that the Jewish world has had to set up a refugee center for these Jews who are fleeing and have nowhere to go."" Among the Ukrainian Jews moving to Israel, Eckstein says they have worked with approximately a dozen Holocaust survivors. On Yom HaShoah, Israel's Holocaust Remembrance Day that commemorates the Nazi extermination of 6 million Jews, these stories of survival reverberate with a renewed energy. Jews who struggled to survive once find themselves fleeing to survive now. ""Most of the [Jewish] people in the Ukraine are Holocaust survivors or children of Holocaust survivors. These are the people who made it, who are able to flee or come back or to stay or to somehow survive the Holocaust."" Margolin was one of these people, able to survive the Holocaust as a soldier in the Soviet Army. His story can be difficult for him to remember sometimes, but it is impossible for his family to forget.

"Britain was hailed as a ‘job-creating machine’ last night as the number of people in work soared to its highest level in history. The Conservatives’ economic strategy also won a stunning international endorsement, with the International Monetary Fund lavishing praise on Chancellor George Osborne. Employment rose above 31million in the three months to February, official figures showed – 557,000 higher than a year before. The Conservatives’ economic strategy  won a stunning international endorsement, with the International Monetary Fund lavishing praise on Chancellor George Osborne (pictured) David Cameron said the Conservatives had overseen a ‘jobs miracle’ and Britain had created more jobs in the last five years than the rest of the EU put together. ‘There are now two million more people in work than in 2010,’ the Prime Minister said. The encouraging numbers came as Rolls-Royce announced its biggest-ever order, worth more than £6billion, to power passenger jets for the Middle Eastern airline Emirates. IMF chief Christine Lagarde and German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble praised Mr Osborne’s ‘wonderful job’ of handling the economy. In a blow to Labour, which has opposed most of the Government’s austerity measures, Mrs Lagarde said the Government had provided the ‘right balance’ of spending cuts and tax rises. The plan had reduced the deficit from a record £153billion under Labour in 2009-10 to £90billion last year. She said she had ‘no doubt that can continue to be the case in the future’ under Mr Osborne’s plans to return Britain to the black in 2018-19, a pledge Labour has failed to match. David Cameron said the Conservatives had overseen a ‘jobs miracle’ and Britain had created more jobs in the last five years than the rest of the EU put together . ‘The fiscal deficit has been significantly reduced over the last few years,’ said Mrs Lagarde. ‘Added to that it is clearly also delivering results. It is obvious that what is happening in the UK has actually worked.’ Mr Schaeuble said he was ‘full of respect’ for what the Chancellor has achieved and delivered what amounted to a highly unusual endorsement of the Tories. ‘The UK and the UK economy has done a wonderful job in the last couple of years,’ he said. ‘The UK and George Osborne has a very good plan for the future. I am very much in favour of what has been achieved and what has been forecast.’ The Chancellor, speaking at the spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank in Washington, said the UK ‘is one of the brightest spots in the world economy at the moment’. ‘I am here representing the UK with an economy that is firmly on course – the deficit halved as a share of GDP, strong growth, record high employment, record low inflation,’ he said. Greece poses the biggest threat to the global economy and the deepening crisis could hit Britain, George Osborne warned yesterday. Fears are mounting that the recession-battered country will default on its debts and be forced to leave the eurozone, creating an economic and political earthquake. The Chancellor (pictured with IMF managing director Christine Lagarde) said the crisis in Greece had made the mood at International Monetary Fund talks in Washington this week ‘notably more gloomy’ The Chancellor said the crisis in Greece had made the mood at International Monetary Fund talks in Washington this week ‘notably more gloomy’. Mr Osborne added: ‘It is clear that a misstep or miscalculation on either side [in Greece] could easily return European economies to the type of perilous situation we saw three to four years ago. ‘It would be a mistake to think that the UK could be immune to a return to this instability in European financial systems and the European economy.’ ‘The British economy is a job-creating machine and we have set out, as a Conservative Party, plans to go on creating jobs, two million further jobs, in the next parliament.’ Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander hailed Britain as the ‘job-creation powerhouse of the western economies’. The Rolls-Royce deal means the Derby-based firm will make the engines for 50 of Emirates’ Airbus A380 planes from its UK factories, where it employs 24,500 people. Emirates’ use of the A380 is said to have created 7,000 UK jobs. Rolls-Royce has worked with Emirates since 1996 but this is the first time it has made engines for the Gulf carrier’s super-jumbo fleet. Labour was forced to welcome the latest employment figures, but Ed Miliband insisted that ‘too often jobs in our country are low-paid, low-skilled and insecure’. ‘It is not just about zero-hours contracts. Young people have done badly, with growing debt, an insecure job and owning a home a distant dream,’ he said. Ed Miliband (pictured) has insisted that ‘too often jobs in our country are low-paid, low-skilled and insecure’ But John Philpott, director of the Jobs Economist website, said two-thirds of the new jobs were full-time and ‘almost all’ were permanent. In more good news, yesterday’s figures showed the unemployment rate has also fallen to pre-crisis levels of 5.6 per cent. It was last this low in June 2008. Wages excluding bonuses are also rising at 1.8 per cent – the highest level since 2012, the Office for National Statistics revealed. This wage increase will feel even higher for workers because the inflation rate is zero.","Employment in UK rose above 31million in last three months to February .

"The British Veterinary Association has withdrawn its support for the shooting of free-running badgers in controversial pilot culls. The two four-year pilot culls in Somerset and Gloucestershire should be completed by trapping the badgers in cages and then shooting them, says the BVA. It concluded that the first two years of culling had not demonstrated conclusively that ‘controlled shooting’ of free-running badgers could be effective and humane. The two four-year pilot culls in Somerset and Gloucestershire should be completed by trapping the badgers in cages and then shooting them, says the BVA . The BVA said it still supported badger culling to tackle tuberculosis in cattle. Animal welfare campaigners welcomed the news but said the BVA’s ongoing support for cage-trapping and shooting was ‘regrettable’. It comes after the Environment Secretary promised to roll out more culls across the country if the Tories win the election. Addressing the National Farmers Union conference in February, Liz Truss said 'any future Conservative government' would push ahead with 'a wider roll-out of the culls', which have been fiercely criticised by wildlife groups. Her comments came as NFU president Meurig Raymond said the incidence of TB had decreased on farms in two pilot areas in Somerset and Gloucestershire where culling of badgers has taken place over the last two years. The Environment Secretary promised to roll out more culls across the country if the Tories win the election . He urged politicians not to make the controversial cull 'a party political issue' in the run-up to the general election, and criticised Labour for pledging to give up on culling. Ms Truss pledged that any future Conservative government would 'take the difficult decisions to deal with this disease'. She told the conference: 'It is shameful that under the previous government bovine TB increased nine-fold and we ended up with the highest levels of the disease in Europe. 'It is incredible that they would like to make the same mistake again.' She said the Government's strategy included cattle movement controls, vaccination in 'edge' areas around disease hotspots, and culling where the disease is rife. 'We will not let up, whatever complaints we get from protest groups. We're in it for the long haul. We will not walk away,' she said to the conference, to applause from farmers. In Gloucestershire just 274 badgers were culled in the second year of the pilot, falling far short of the minimum 615 estimated to be needed to deliver reductions in TB in livestock, leading the chief vet to admit the benefits of the cull might not be realised there. The Government claimed the low numbers in Gloucestershire reflected the 'challenges of extensive unlawful protest and intimidation' by anti-cull campaigners. In Somerset, where the other pilot cull has been carried out, a sufficient number of badgers were killed this year to lead to expected reductions in TB in cattle, with 341 culled, in a required range of 316 to 785.","British Veterinary Association has withdrawn its support of pilot culls .

"Koby Hodder, suffered a cardiac arrest and collapsed in the school playground when he was 10 . A 10-year-old boy nearly died after suffering a cardiac arrest in the school playground. Koby Hodder's heart stopped for a staggering 12 minutes after he collapsed while running around with friends during the morning break. He was playing British Bulldog – a game in which children run from one side of a playing field to another without being caught by one of the ‘bulldogs’, who often employ forceful tactics to trap runners, including rugby tackling opponents to the ground. Teachers across the country have called for the game to be banned, claiming it is dangerous and leads to children becoming injured. In the middle of playing the game, Koby suffered a cardiac arrest. This is where the electrical activity of the heart becomes so chaotic that it stops pumping and quivers or ‘fibrillates’ instead. His heart suddenly stopped beating blood around his body and he collapsed and lost consciousness. The 10-year-old was later diagnosed with the same heart condition as footballer Fabrice Muamba, a former Bolton Wanderers  player who collapsed after suffering a cardiac arrest during the first half of Bolton's FA Cup quarter-final against Tottenham in 2012. Mr Muamba was 'effectively dead' for 78 minutes and had to be shocked 15 times before his heart restarted. Teachers at Koby’s school in Doncaster, were able to give Koby CPR until paramedics arrived and saved his life. His father, Mark, 45, got a call from the school at around 11am on March 2, and was told to get to the school immediately. He said: 'I was working around the corner so I was able to get straight over there and when I saw Koby on the ground I knew he was dead. 'Teachers were giving him CPR but I could see he was grey and lifeless. I couldn't even go to him. I was devastated.' Luckily he was brought back to life when paramedics Lee Murphy and Martin Parkinson and emergency care assistant Freddie Stevens arrived, and were able to save him by giving Koby two shocks with a defibrillator. A cardiac arrest happens when the heart stops pumping blood around your body. The most common cause of a cardiac arrest is a life threatening abnormal heart rhythm called ventricular fibrillation (VF). Ventricular fibrillation happens when the electrical activity of your heart becomes so chaotic that the heart stops pumping and quivers or 'fibrillates' instead. Someone who is having a cardiac arrest will suddenly lose consciousness and will stop breathing or stop breathing normally. Unless immediately treated by CPR this always leads to death within minutes. It is possible to survive and recover from a cardiac arrest, with the right treatment. Ventrivular fibrillation - which causes an arrest - can sometimes be corrected by giving an electric shock through the chest wall, by using a device called a defibrillator. Source: British Heart Foundation . Koby, who turned 11 two weeks ago, was rushed to Doncaster Royal Infirmary, where he seemed to be making a recovery. Just as he seemed to be improving, he suffered another attack, and was transferred to Leeds General Infirmary Paediatric Intensive Care Unit. Mr Hodder, a builder and father-of-three, said: 'We were beside ourselves with worry. 'Koby is super-fit, he plays football three times a week and goes boxing two times a week. ‘How could this happen in someone so young?’ Koby’s mother, Joanne Hodder, 43, added: 'Can you imagine what we were going through? 'We didn't even have a clue what had happened to Koby. ‘We didn't think for a moment that he could have had a heart problem. 'I had dropped him off to school that morning and he was his happy little self. ‘We had no warning. Koby is a bit of a joker so when he collapsed even his friends thought he was messing around, until they noticed he wasn't breathing.' While Koby was in hospital doctors fitted him with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) to shock his heart back into rhythm should it ever stop again. Muamba, 26, was fitted with the same implant after his high profile collapse three years ago. Mr Hodder said: 'At the moment we don't know what has caused Koby to have a heart problem. It is baffling.' Koby, who is now 11, suffered a series of cardiac arrests, where the heart suddenly stops pumping blood around the body, and was treated in intensive care . Koby had a device fitted to his heart which will shock it back into beating if it ever stops again. He is pictured in hospital with boxer Josh Warrington . Mr and Mrs Hodder are due to have tests to see if Koby's heart condition is hereditary. His brother and sister, Joel, 27, and Courteney, 20, may also have to be tested. Mrs Hodder, said: 'I cannot thank each and every person who played a part in saving Koby's life and helped with his recovery, enough. 'Teachers, paramedics and hospital staff have all been amazing. 'As a parent it is your worst nightmare to receive a phone call like I did from school, when you sent your healthy 10-year-old child there fit and well that morning. 'Doctors have said that the fact that Koby was running around at the time of the attack may have helped him - because it meant his heart was pumping.' Koby knows he is lucky to be alive, but his dream of being a professional footballer has been taken from him. Koby had played with both Leeds United and Doncaster Rovers youth teams and dreamed of playing for his beloved Leeds United when he got older. Mr Hodder said: 'Doctors have said he can play with friends as long as he doesn't exert himself too much. ‘They've said that if he can exercise and talk at the same time then that's okay, but playing professionally is out of the question. Koby suffered from the same heart condition as Fabrice Muamba, a Bolton Wanderers football player who collapsed after a cardiac arrest during the first half of Bolton's FA Cup quarter-final against Tottenham . 'Maybe Koby would not have been a professional footballer but he is gutted, understandably.' Mrs Hodder said: 'When Koby feels down we tell him that he is very lucky to be here and that makes him feel better. 'But he is still recovering and sometimes he feels scared, but he is still getting used to his defibrillator. It's a big thing he has had to deal with. 'For his birthday he didn't want a sleepover as we had originally planned, instead we went for a day out to York. 'Koby has come a long way and even returned to school this month. 'He's had a fantastic recovery so far, which is all down to the fast response from the school staff and the paramedics. 'He's doing better than we could have ever imagined. I am so grateful we still have our little boy with us.'

"A hospital in Western Australia is in hot water after blood and bone fragments were found on supposedly sanitised medical instruments. The $2 billion Fiona Stanley Hospital in southwest Perth was stripped of its medical service provider Serco after they failed to return sterilising equipment by an arranged date in February. The company was fined $60,000 and was subject to Department of Health workers auditing its staff, but the hospital has been found of continuing to operate with poorly sanitised instruments, reports ABC. The $2 billion Fiona Stanley Hospital in southwest Perth was found to have blood and bone fragments of some its medical instruments . Australian Medical Association WA president Michael Gannon said some of the instruments were found to contain blood and human matter. 'There's been reports of bits of bone on some orthopaedic equipment, there's been reports, that are really hard to believe, of blood still being seen on some instruments,' he said. 'So this gives us great concerns. We've been told the problem's been fixed and this would suggest that it hasn't. Dr Gannon said the latest revelations will further damage the hospitals public image, generating a loss of morale within its workforce. 'I can't imagine how people must feel if they've got surgery booked at the hospital at some stage,' he said. The hospital was stripped of its medical service provider Serco after they failed to return sterilising equipment by an arranged date in February . There has been a string of controversial incidents in the hospital, including the death of a patient last month who went into a coma.

"A pair of British expats say they are ‘trapped’ in southern Spain amid an ongoing legal battle with the local town hall over a luxury bed and breakfast they once operated. Patrick and Valerie Jubb are attempting to sell the four-bedroom property where they currently reside in Jimena de la Frontera, but it is now on the brink of being torn down. The retired couple told Spain’s Olive Press news website that they have done nothing wrong but face losing the estate over illegal additions made by a previous owner. Patrick and Valerie Jubb are locked in a dispute with the town hall over alterations made by a previous owner . The Jubbs purchased the bed and breakfast in Jimena de la Frontera, in southern Spain, in 2008 . Patrick, 64, told the news website: ‘We are in absolute pieces over this. ‘All we want is to go back to the UK to be with our family and friends, but we can’t. All our money is tied up in the property.’ Patrick, a former engineer from London, and his 63-year-old wife, Valerie, bought the bed and breakfast, La Vina de Linan, in 2008 and closed it a year ago as they moved forward with plans to sell it. They said they had a deal in place to sell the estate for €680,000, but the town hall ruled that the first floor, kitchen and pool were illegally built by previous owners in 1994. The Jubbs said they obtained a certificate that stated there were no infractions when they bought the estate . When the Jubbs tried to sell the town hall ruled that the alterations, including a swimming pool, were illegal . The Jubbs told the Olive Press that the Junta provided a certificate stating there were no planning infractions when they bought the property, and that the alterations were legalised by land registry officials in 2005 – three years before they acquired the estate. In most situations the local authority loses the right to demolish a house that has been illegally altered if it fails to detect the alterations within four years. But in the case of the Jubbs the usual rule does not apply because the property is located inside Los Alcornocales Natural Park in the Andalusian province of Cadiz. Patrick and Valerie Jubb are planning to move back to the UK, but said their money is tied up in the property . Patrick said the alterations never should have been approved in the first place. Online adverts still list the Jubbs’ property for sale, with a guide price of €875,000. With a sparkling rating on TripAdvisor, it is marketed as a secluded and private property with panoramic mountain views. It is located just 25 minutes from Gibraltar and 90 minutes from Malaga airport. The home boasts four en-suite bedrooms, a large sitting room with a fireplace, a dining room and terraces.","Patrick and Valerie Jubb purchased the property in Andalusia in 2008 .

"A 3-year-old's recurring nightmare about a mysterious white van may help shed light on what really happened the day her mother died in an SUV crash that Virginia police have ruled a tragic accident. Natali Castellanos-Tyler, 30, a married mother of three from Chesterfield County, was returning home from a birthday party February 21 with her daughter, Elisa, in the backseat when she supposedly slid off a rain-soaked road, slammed her silver Ford Explorer into a tree and died at the scene. Investigators concluded that the crash was a one-car collision that was caused by poor road conditions. Scroll down for video . Loss: Natali Castellanos-Tyler, 30, pictured with her husband, Craig, and their two children, was killed in an SUV crash in Virginia two months ago to the day . Deadly impact: Castellanos-Tyler was just a few miles from her home when her 2002 Ford Explorer ran off the road in the 15400 block of Genito Road and careened into a tree . Accident: Police said the crash was a one-car collision caused by a rain-soaked road . Elisa Tyler emerged from the accident largely unscathed, but according to her father, Craig Tyler, the little girl has been plagued by disturbing nightmares and daytime visions about the accident. 'She’ll just start walking and she’ll start screaming, ""The van, the white van!”' the young widower told CBS6. 'I’ll say, ""What happened with the white van?"" And she says, ""It hurt me — it hurt my car!”' Tyler, who is now raising his their children, ages 9, 3 and 1, on his own after his wife's passing, at first did not know what to make of Elisa's night terrors. But then this past weekend he came across several Facebook posts from nearby communities of Foxcroft and Magnolia Green about a series of hit-and-run accidents involving a white box truck. One Facebook user, 17-year-old Caitlyn Thomas, claimed she was side-swiped by a white delivery-style truck on Otterdale Road March 30; the impact of the collision reportedly sent a piece of her side-view mirror crashing through the driver's window. Doubt: Little Elisa, pictured left with her parents and baby brother, and right with her mom, has been having nightmares and daytime visions about a white van, which her father believes may have something to do with the crash . Widower: Craig Tyler says the toddler, pictured above, has told him that the white van in her dreams 'hurt' her and her car . Sightings: A plain white delivery-style box truck, possibly similar to the one pictured above, has been linked to no fewer than three hit-and-run incidents in which two cars and a school bus were side-swiped . According to an eyewitness, the driver of the truck briefly slowed down and turned his head back to look at Thomas' damaged car, but then took off from the scene without waiting for police to arrive. A day earlier, Subastree Thompson said she was also side-swiped by a white box truck on the same road. According to the woman, who was driving with her 3-year-old in the backseat, the white van was carrying two or three men sitting in a single row. The van slowed down for a moment but then sped off before Thompson had a chance to take down its license plate number. Then on April 3, a plain white van matching the same description as in the two earlier incidents allegedly side-swiped a school bus filled with students from Cosby High School. Chesterfield County Police said they were investigating a possible connection between the crashes, but a spokesperson for the department said there was no evidence in Castellano-Tyler's collision to suggest the involvement of another vehicle. Dashing duo: Natali, a native of El Salvador, and Craig met by chance at a restaurant several years ago and married in a courthouse in 2013 . The 30-year-old leaves behind three children, including a 9-year-old boy from a previous relationship in El Salvador and her and Craig's two kids, ages 1 and 3 . Tragic twist: The couple had been planning to have a formal wedding ceremony this coming July and Natali had picked out an ivory lace dress (pictured) for the big day. Instead, she was laid to rest in her dream gown . The woman was just a few miles from her home when at 2pm her 2002 Ford Explorer ran off the road in the 15400 block of Genito Road and careened into a tree, reported the station WRIC. Paramedics arrived on the scene but it was too late for the mother. Her daughter Elisa was taken to a hospital with minor scrapes and bruises. On Monday, nearly two months to the day after the crash, Natali’s husband, Craig, wrote on his Facebook page that he was praying ‘for the truth to be revealed.’ He and Natali, a native of El Salvador, met years earlier at a local restaurant and married with little fanfare in a courthouse on June 21, 2012. The couple had been planning to have a formal wedding ceremony this coming July, followed by a long-awaited honeymoon. Natali had an ivory lace gown picked out for the big day, but instead of wearing it to go down the aisle, she was laid to rest in her dream dress February 27 in the presence of her heartbroken family. A GoFundMe account has been set up to help cover some of the Tyler family's living expenses. So far, more than $15,440 has been raised.","Natali Castellanos-Tyler, 30, married mother of three from Virginia, was killed when she crashed into tree February 21 .

"A Canadian man found a novel way to take in the sights while travelling across country, by taking an rocking chair with him. Kalman Kallai enjoyed the spectacular Canadian scenery from the comfort of a green chair while journeying from Borden, Ontario to Comox, British Columbia for work purposes. Calculating that the drive would take him across a colossal 2,796 miles (4500km) of land, Mr Kallai believed that his journey would be more interesting if he used it as an opportunity to see more of his country. The traveller sits before corn, a café, boats and water, before he is featured rocking and making gestures with his hand . Mr Kallai and a friend mimic the planes that fly past at the beginning of the traveller's adventure . After picking up a green rocking chair that he acquired for free from online advertisement site Kijiji, the traveller attached his trailer and set off on the nine-day journey. The video begins with Mr Kallai carrying his chair to a wooded area, before placing it down and taking a seat. He wears a green hoody, blue jacket and hat – clothing items that remain a running theme throughout the course of the video. Mr Kallai travelled from Borden, Ontario to Comox, British Columbia for work purposes . Sat rocking on his chair watching a number of aeroplanes taking off – perhaps at this point wishing he was on one himself – the traveller is joined by a friend. The pair sit and mimic the plane’s wings before shaking hands and waving goodbye to one another, to allow Mr Kallai to continue his adventure on his own. The traveller is then sat before corn, a café, boats and water, before he is featured rocking and making gestures with his hands. The traveller wears a green hoody, blue jacket and hat in every clip of himself in the video . Mr Kallai takes time to pose precariously on a river bed while journeying across Canada . He momentarily leaves the chair to chase some birds on a beach before making his way through a field and waving at some cows. Later in the video the traveller is met by his dad, who humorously steals the rocking chair before he is swiftly removed. Continuing a good portion of the journey together, the pair dance and jump around in front of rapids and tease a number of large statues. Creature comfort! Mr Kallai makes a number of hand gestures in the video and even waves at cows . Despite hauling the rocking chair around in a trailer, the traveller is also featured carrying it on his head . Mr Kallai said: ‘I brought my dad with me for part of the trek. It was a great bonding experience, as we shared many laughs. ‘I heard some pretty interesting stories about his youth that I hadn't heard before, especially since my mother wasn't on the trip with us.’ The pair reach Manitoba together before they meet with some people and the traveller’s father leaves his son to journey on by himself.

"Wisconsin ended Kentucky's bid to become the first college basketball team to remain undefeated in nearly 40 years, beating the Wildcats 71-64 behind 20 points and 11 rebounds from Frank Kaminsky. Wisconsin will play Duke, an 81-61 winner over Michigan State in the earlier semi-final, at the Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis on Monday night. 'It gives us another 40 minutes, I know that,' said Wisconsin coach Bo Ryan, who leads the Badgers to their first final since 1941.

Wisconsin moved through to the final with a tense victory over Kentucky at the Lucas Oil Stadium . And Kentucky has a long ride home, finishing the season at 38-1 - two wins short of becoming the first undefeated team in college basketball since the 1975-76 Indiana Hoosiers. Instead, these NBA-ready group of Wildcats join the star-studded 1991 UNLV team as the latest to take an undefeated record into the Final Four but lose in the semifinals. Trailing by four and gasping for breath after going 6 minutes without a bucket, the Badgers (36-3) responded with an 8-0 run to take a lead Kentucky couldn't overcome. Kaminsky and Bronson Koenig went 7 for 8 from the line over the last 24 seconds to seal the win. The 70,000-capacity Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, home of the Colts in the NFL, is hosting the Final Four . Wisconsin Badgers fans cheer on their team at the Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis . Kentucky's last, best chance came while trailing by three with 12 seconds left. But Karl-Anthony Towns received the ball in the post and got fouled. He made only one free throw, and from there, Wisconsin clinched it from the foul-line. Earlier Saturday, Justise Winslow scored 19 points and Jahlil Okafor added 18 to lead top-seeded Duke to an 81-61 victory over Michigan State on Saturday and a shot at its fifth national championship. Winslow, who played through some early foul trouble, had nine rebounds and was 5 for 7 from the field, while Okafor grabbed six rebounds and was 7 for 11 from the field. Duke celebrated reaching the final of the NCAA Tournament with a 81-61 win over Michigan State . Justise Winslow of the Duke Blue Devils goes up for a dunk in the semi-final in Indianapolis . Senior Quinn Cook had 17 points for the Blue Devils, who dominated the game except for the opening minutes when they trailed 14-6. Defensively, it was a team effort, just the way coach Mike Krzyzewski has stressed for his 35 seasons at Duke. What had been wide open 3-pointers early for Michigan State became contested shots and when the Blue Devils started getting up and on the Spartans, the points were suddenly tough to come by. Denzel Valentine finished with 22 points, which included hitting three quick 3-pointers in the first quarter to give the No.7 seed Michigan State an early lead. Trice scored 16 points and Branden Dawson added 12 for the Spartans.","Wisconsin beat Kentucky 71-64 at Lucas Oil Stadium in Final Four .

"A young woman has revealed details about her lengthy battle with a rare condition that left her unable to eat anything for a year and a half – despite the fact that she still felt desperately hungry. Kyli Wilfson, a self-confessed ‘food person’, was 26 when she first started experiencing agonizing pain – which made her feel like she had been ‘kicked in the abdomen' – whenever she ate, a symptom which doctors initially brushed off as being due to a mild pancreatic problem which would ‘resolve itself’ in a matter of days. Kyli, now 29, was eventually diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis, and the North Carolina resident found herself looking at a lifetime spent on a feeding tube, as the disease, which effects less than .01 per cent of people, would only get worse. Within months she had dropped to a startling 80lbs, she revealed to Cosmopolitan.com, and  had to postpone her wedding as she spent more and more time in hospitals. Mystery illness: Kyli Wolfson, pictured, had trouble getting a correct diagnosis when she woke up in excruciating pain in October 2012; her illness left her unable to eat for a year and a half . At first, doctors faced difficulties even diagnosing Kyli; though she'd had digestive problems for years, her rare disease wasn't initially considered. Instead, doctors at her local ER insisted that she had acute pancreatitis, a condition that commonly effects heavy drinkers. However, Kyli's pain continued to return every time she tried to eat anything — even soup — leading her to visit two more hospitals in search of a new diagnosis and a cure. 'It never even changed,' she said, explaining that when she tried to eat, it felt like she was burning on the inside. 'It was still ten-out-of-ten pain.' Three months after her first visit to the emergency room, she was finally diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis, a condition she had likely had since birth but was only found after doctors put a camera down her throat to her pancreas — a potentially life-threatening procedure that was only tried after all other options had been exhausted. Literally starving: Still maintaining an appetite but unable to eat without pain, Kyli was constantly hungry — leading her fiancé Dustin Wood to feel bad eating in front of her . Rapid weight loss: Kyli's weight, which is normally at around 110lbs, dropped to 80lbs when she was at her lightest . Sufferers of the illness, which is characterized by an inflammation of the pancreas, have to be fed through a feeding tube because the condition never improves, and eventually leads to permanent damage. Kyli spent a year and half abstaining from eating entirely, which was an incredibly trying ordeal for both her and her fiancé Dustin Wood. 'We're food people,' she said. 'We [love] to bake, order takeout. Now he felt bad eating in front of me.' Luckily, Kyli found a support group for people who have chronic pancreatitis on Facebook, some of whom said they found a way to eat: a risky surgical procedure to remove the pancreas, spleen, gallbladder, appendix, and duodenum, which allows the pancreas' cells to be transplanted into the liver, enabling it to function as a pancreas. So Kyli flew to a hospital in Minnesota that specializes in the 14-hour surgery, and scheduled her procedure for January 2014. Enduring love: Kyli's wedding to fiancé Dustin is back on, now scheduled three years after she first went to the emergency room with stomach pain . After her surgery, Kyli spent another two and a half weeks using a feeding tube before being told to try food again. 'I was excited, but nervous, since it had been so long since I'd eaten,' she said. 'Sure enough, I had chicken broth and juice and it didn't affect anything. It was amazing.' She soon began enjoying ice cream, lobster, and pizza, and was able to return to her normal weight of 110lbs. 'The number one thing that helped was the support group I joined and knowing other people going through it,' she said. 'They saved me and gave me hope.' Now feeling healthy and grateful for the transformative surgery, Kyli was able to reschedule her wedding to Dustin. She will walk down the aisle in October.","Kyli Wolfson, 29, felt severe pain whenever she ate thanks to the disorder, which developed in October 2012, when she was 26 .

"From the lack of sleep to breastfeeding, becoming a mother for the first time is no mean feat. One new mother decided to start a blog called Upfront Mama detailing the trials and tribulations of raising her little girl Poppy, 14 months, who, she says, is the best and most life changing thing that has ever happened to her. Like so many new mothers, Nicola Bonn, 34, from London was learning on the job and found the whole experience 'exciting yet utterly petrifying'. Scroll down for video . Nicola Bonn, 34, from London, started a candid blog called Upfront Mama detailing the trials and tribulations of raising her little girl Poppy, 14 months, and many of her posts have gone viral . She wanted to share all the things that she had learnt so that fellow mothers wouldn’t feel as 'clueless' as she did. One of her blog posts, Why We Need to Stop Justifying Ourselves, went viral - no doubt thanks to her candid account of bringing up a baby for the first time. Here, she shares it with FEMAIL... 'Since becoming a mama I’ve spent way too much time explaining myself and almost apologising for my decisions and I’ve decided that it has to stop. 'The problem is that when you have a baby, everyone has an opinion and they’re often not afraid to air it which can be quite overwhelming for a new mother who is less experienced than the 'advice giver' and is most probably filled with high levels of self doubt. Nicola, 34, wanted to share all the things that she had learnt so that fellow mothers wouldn’t feel as 'clueless' as she did, and admits that since becoming a mother, she's spent way too much time explaining herself and almost apologising for her decisions - and she's decided that it has to stop . She believes one of the main hurdles is that everyone has an opinion and they're often not afraid to air it, which. she says, can be quite overwhelming for a new mother who is less experienced . 'Over the past year, countless people have questioned decisions that I have made. They always do it in this seemingly innocent but quite obviously judgemental way that is hair-pullingly irritating and invariably follow it with a comment about what they might do better. 'Off the top of my head, here are some examples: . 1. You’re still feeding Poppy milk when she wakes up during the night? Oh I wouldn’t do that..she’s far too old. 2. You rock her to sleep? Do you not think she should be self settling at this age? 3. You encourage her to play with her food? Isn’t that encouraging bad manners? 4. You don’t breast feed? You do know that it really is best for bonding? 5. You take her on the underground? It’s full of germs. Why do you do that? 'Instead of doing what I should and saying 'yes I do' in a firm but polite way and ending the conversation there, I always go into great detail about why I do these things. 'No, I don’t breast feed because I find it really tough. I tried but I couldn’t do it and it was actually affecting the bonding process. I do express though…lots and it’s  exhausting but I do it because I’m trying to do my best. Nicola often finds other mothers saying to her: 'You encourage her to play with her food? Isn't that encouraging bad manners?' but says she has to believe in the choices that she makes on a daily basis because if she starts doubting herself then it won't do anyone any good…least of all Poppy .

I know it’s probably not advisable at her age but it means that she goes to sleep faster and I’m knackered and I need a break and a glass of wine ASAP! 'Yes, I take her on the underground. I can’t drive and that’s how we get around and she loves it.

'I’m the first person to ask for advice when I need it and I often do. 'In fact, I think that one of the most beautiful things about motherhood is women passing on wisdom that they have learnt from generation to generation. It creates a magical bond amongst us that makes you proud to be a female and more importantly a mother. But, there is a difference between kindly passing on wisdom and questioning and judging fellow mamas. 'So, next time we feel judged for a decision that we have made concerning our child, let’s not explain ourselves. 'Instead, let’s believe in what we are doing and keep doing it.

"When the ultra-rich splash out on a new superyacht, they expect it to come with all the latest accessories. And that's exactly what they get with the 223ft Explorer, which comes with its own helipad, infinity pool and plenty for space for supercar and jetski storage. With space for 12 lucky guests on board, the concept yacht from British yacht designer Tony Castro is the ultimate toy for the extremely wealthy and has been dubbed the 'Range Rover of the seas'. The 223ft Explorer is an exclusive superyacht which comes with its own helipad and car storage as well as space for 12 guests . For those who don't fancy taking a dip in the sea, there is an infinity pool on deck which is two decks deep . For those who would rather board unseen, there is a helipad and helicopter storage as well as space for a submarine . It was designed to withstand any weather conditions and is sturdy enough to circumnavigate the globe - all while looking incredibly stylish, of course. When it comes to transporting all those extras any cruising millionaire needs to hand, there's plenty of space for all of them. The company explains: 'With a large carrying capacity for toys and tenders, she is capable of carrying a helicopter in a climate controlled garage, twin limo tenders, car, submarine, jetskis, paddleboards and a variety of inflatables water toys.' Once the helicopter has landed, it can be store din a climate-controlled garage area . There is storage for jetskis and a submarine on the decks, while leaving plenty of other areas free for passengers . But of course, the life of the ultra-wealthy comes at a cost. According to Tony Castro Design, the superyacht costs approximately 40million euros (around £29million/$43million) to build, which means it is likely to cost even more to purchase. While the yacht has been designed with 'rugged utilitarian-looking aesthetics', it is actually a sumptuous retreat at sea. For the 12 guests, there is space on the yacht for 15 crew, ensuring there is nothing always someone on hand to make sure the journey goes smoohtly. The layout means there are a huge variety of different areas for guests to retreat to, ensuring they don't get fed up with each other while sailing around the world. And for those who can't bear to leave their convertible at home, they can even bring their car on board . Special sundecks open out form the yacht, providing areas for loungers, complete with ladders down into the sea in case guests want to cool off in the water . Unfortunately for most, the superyacht costs 40million euros to build, meaning it will retail for even more . The designers explain: 'Her unique layout holds a full beam enclosed observation deck with opening roof, cinema, beach club, sauna, scuba diving pool, gymnasium, pool, wine cellar and ample space to accommodate a total of 12 guests.' And of course, there are all the other luxurious finishing touches you would expect to find on board. The guests of honour can enjoy accommodation in the Master Cabin or VIP suite, while others can choose between four other double guest cabins. There are also plenty of 'terrace' area, with sunloungers, giving the impression of sitting on the beach as the water laps the sands. In reality, the wooden areas just out into the sea with ladders down so guests can take a dip to cool off whenever they wish. And the entire design is offset with panoramic windows offering views across the ocean. The sleek yacht is a design by Tony Castro, who is base din The Hamble, Hampshire, which is known as a true home of yachting .","The Tony Castro design is estimated to cost 40million euros (£29m/$43m) to build and more to buy .

"For residents of Celoron, N.Y., the statue of hometown icon Lucile Ball is no laughing matter and hasn't been for the past six years. In 2009 the town unveiled a statue of Ball with a face so unlike the beloved comedian that locals have reacted with shock and horror. The depiction is so unflattering a Facebook page called 'We Love Lucy! Get Rid of this Statue' has attracted more than 600 likes. Scroll down for video . For residents of Celoron, N.Y., say a statue of hometown icon Lucile Ball is 'monstrous' The statue is based on a famous moment from Ball's show 'I Love Lucy,' in which she pitches an intoxicating health tonic while drunk . Yahoo reports that the anonymous man behind the page says he's a 'big fan of Lucy's.' 'Lucille Ball was not only an amazing comedienne, but she was a stunning beauty. Her sense of humor only made her more beautiful,” he told the site. 'This statue looks nothing like the beautiful Lucy we all know. If for no other reason than that... the statue should go.' He added: 'I don’t think this can be repaired. Take a look at the beautiful statues Nick at Nite created for ‘Bewitched’ and ‘The Honeymooners’ and Bob Newhart… it needs to be something more like those.' Artist Dave Poulin has declined comment. It would cost an estimated $8,000 to $10,000 for Poulin to recast the statue, according to the Celoron Mayor Scott Schrecengost. While the organizer said he is a fan of Poulin's work, this time he failed to do his subject justice. Artist Dave Poulin has declined to comment on the controversy surrounding his work . 'I think it looks like a monster. That is just my opinion,' he told Yahoo. 'When you see it at night, it is frightening.' The statue depicts Ball during one of her most loved moments on the pioneering show 'I Love Lucy,' her intoxicated pitch for the Vitameatavegamin health tonic. The statue was the latest way the town has tried to honor its most famous resident, with the Jameston area already home to a Lucille Ball Desi Arnaz Museum & Center for Comedy.","The depiction is so unflattering a Facebook page called 'We Love Lucy!

"Dick Advocaat will not make the same mistake he did during his first season at Rangers by playing down the significance of the Old Firm derby. The 67-year-old takes charge of Sunderland for the first time on home soil tomorrow with North-East adversaries Newcastle the visitors. It was back in 1998 that Advocaat said the Old Firm clash was just another game. Celtic won 5-1 and the Dutch boss was criticised by fans and the media for under-estimating the intensity of the rivalry. Sunderland boss Dick Advocaat insists he will not underestiamte the signficance of the Wear-Tyne Derby . Advocaat and assistant manager Paul Bracewell oversee training ahead of Sunday's crucial derby fixture . Sunderland striker Jermain Defoe (centre) trains with his team-mates ahead of the game with Newcastle . Rangers' Rod Wallace (centre) runs forward with the ball as his side are thrashed 5-1 by Celtic in 1998 . Advocaat had failed to recognise the significance of the Old Firm fixture and this led to a humiliating loss . He recalled: 'To be honest, I did not realise at that moment it was so huge. 'We lost that game and I remember saying in the press conference when they were really upset, 'It is no problem for me because it is just one of 38 games and we will not lose any more'. 'I would not say that anymore! But we became champions that year, six points ahead of Celtic, and won the treble.' Advocaat, though, does admit that his thoughts are trained on three points and not the notion of regional bragging rights. Indeed, the Black Cats are one point above the relegation zone and could be in the bottom three by kick-off. 'Every game is a chance to get a result – and that starts on Sunday,' said Advocaat, who could start Adam Johnson for the first time following his arrest on suspicion of sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl. Sunderland's Adam Johnson was recently arrested on suspicion of sexual activity with an under-age girl . Advocaat is still considering starting the 27-year-old England international in the Wear-Tyne derby . 'If we win the fans might like me, yes, but I would prefer it if they loved me at the end of the season because that would mean we have stayed up.' Sunderland have won just twice at home all season. They have struggled amid an atmosphere of unrest at the Stadium of Light, but that should change tomorrow given the unveiling of Advocaat and the opponents. 'For us, this must be a weapon,' said Advocaat when asked about the home crowd. 'That is the reason I said it is so important to get them behind us, because it is an extra weapon. If the players feel that, they will give even more and I expect that the fans will do that. This is a special game.'

"(CNN)Most companies in South Korea have hoesik at least once a month and sometimes every week. Literally, this means dinner with co-workers. In practice, it means official eating/drinking fests involving multiple rounds of alcohol at multiple venues. For the foreign business traveler, using foreignness as an excuse to bow out of the action only goes so far. The pressure to participate is intense. Drinking etiquette is the first thing you teach foreign guests,"" says Bryan Do, a Korean-American director at the South Korean branch of a U.S. company. ""It was shocking when I first arrived in Korea. ""My boss was a graduate of Korea University [renowned for its hardy drinking culture] and at my first hoesik, we started out with everyone filling a beer glass with soju, and downing it on the spot. That was just the beginning."" For Koreans, drinking is considered a way to get to know what someone is really like. ""I didn't really like it in the beginning,"" says Charles Lee, a Korean-Canadian who came to Seoul to work for a South Korean company. ""I was like, 'Why are you making me drink something when I don't want to?' But once I understood the meaning behind it, I appreciated it more. ""There are just some things you can't say at work or talk about over lunch -- people who talk about work at lunch are losers. But when someone offers you a glass of soju, it's an invitation that means that they want to listen to you. ""I thought Koreans were impersonal before I drank with them, so the whole context is important."" Drinking is such a big part of Korean life that Seoul traffic is said to correspond with the city's drinking culture. Mondays are a big night for hoesik, so there are fewer cars during evening rush hour, as most office workers leave them at work so they can go drinking. Tuesdays are a rest day, while Wednesday and Thursday nights are also big nights for company drinking. Fridays have the worst evening traffic, as everyone is taking their cars home to use with their families over the weekend. So how do you avoid offending someone (worst of all, a superior or client) at a Korean drinking extravaganza? Follow these seven handy rules. Koreans always identify the ""higher"" person in the relationship, and defer to them accordingly. One of the first things Koreans often ask when meeting someone new is their age. Even someone just a year older is afforded a language of respect, though age is always superseded by a higher position. It's considered rude for anyone to have an empty glass. If a senior person is pouring -- this usually pertains to hard liquor only -- others shouldn't drink until someone has poured the senior a shot. After all glasses are full, everyone says ""Gunbae!"" and chugs -- usually ""one-shotting"" the entire glass in one go. While downing alcohol, you should turn your body away from senior figures so that your body visually blocks your drinking action from your senior. Always hold bottles or shot glasses with both hands. By raising your glass or pouring alcohol with one hand, you are establishing yourself as a senior person. If you're not, well, you've just breached protocol. It's always a good idea to find out people's drinking habits beforehand. It shouldn't be difficult to find out what people like to drink or how they behave when intoxicated. Hoesik usually involves changing venues for a different type of alcohol -- i.e., round one is dinner, accompanied by beer, round two is soju, round three is for whiskey, and so on. Be ready for each. Unless you have an airtight reason, refusing alcohol is considered a mood killer and deemed rude. Sorry, but ""I don't like soju"" doesn't qualify as a good reason not to punish your liver. Neither would ""I've been on the wagon for three years."" In fact, unless you're pregnant or already puking, what might be a ""good reason"" not to imbibe elsewhere often won't fly here. It's generally best to accept and discreetly get rid of unwanted alcohol (under the table, into your water cup, out the window) than to refuse it. One of the most popular venues in Korea for business drinking is the karaoke bar. Koreans love singing, as evidenced by the country's staggering number of karaoke bars, as well as the rush of audition programs on Korean television. Your companions won't rest until you sing. They'll coax, threaten, push and cajole until you finally take that mic. Be prepared to crack under the immense peer pressure. If you simply cannot take any more, you can call a black knight (male) or a black rose (female) to your rescue. This entails a person of your choosing drinking your glass for you, but it also means they get a wish. As in, you might soon wish you'd just taken that last shot as you're spelling your name out with your butt in front of your client. Bottoms up. Christopher Cha is a Korean-American writer based in Seoul.","Hoesik is the Korean tradition of eating and drinking together .

"Older people are more susceptible to emotions when making decisions over their retirement, scientists have warned (file picture) Older people are more susceptible to emotions when making decisions over their retirement, scientists have warned. Experts in America found that more than 50 per cent of pensioners with investments during the 2007 and 2008 global financial crisis panicked and sold them after the stock market fell by 30 per cent. Research carried out by scientists at Texas Tech University showed how those who did follow that path and sold at the lowest point eight years ago with a pension of £100,000 would only have £63,000 today. If they had resisted the temptation to sell, the same pot would be worth £141,000 today provided they had not spent any of the cash. It comes just days before retirees in Britain are given the power to decide how to spend their life savings for the first time ever in the biggest shake-up of pensions for almost a century. The Daily Telegraph quotes the authors of the study, Michael Finke and Chris Browning as saying: ‘Avoiding mistakes requires the ability to regulate emotions through our more rational cognitive process. ‘Consumers are increasingly responsible for managing their retirement savings... (but) we also find that cognitive scores decline with advance age.’ The newspaper says 1,204 retired people with investments between 2006 and 2008 were analysed as part of the study, which has been published in the Journal of Consumer Affairs. It reveals that retirees with better-than-average ability to solve ‘logic problems’ were more unlikely to make misjudgments in the investment market based on their emotions. The authors add: 'Lower levels of cognitive ability in old age can reduce an investor's ability to control emotional responses to a loss. Anyone in Britain turning 55 who isn’t in a final salary scheme will soon be allowed to dip in to their pension and take the income they need, under reforms announced by George Osborne (pictured) 'Greater sensitivity to loss may increase preferences for safety following a market decline, resulting in allocations away from stocks that are associated with long-term underperformance.' Under reforms announced by Chancellor George Osborne, anyone in Britain turning 55 who isn’t in a final salary scheme will simply be allowed to dip in to their pension and take the income they need from April 5. They could keep the money invested in the stock market to boost their profits. And if they die their spouse or loved ones will be able to inherit whatever is left over.","Half of pensioners in US with investments during 2007 financial crisis sold them at wrong time, research finds .

"A Mayfair mansion that was once the site of a milking parlour has gone on the market for £25million. The four-bedroom property in central London's Farm Street has all the trappings of modern luxury with an indoor swimming pool, gym, lift, cinema room and roof terrace. One hundred and fifty years ago however it was used to house cows for milking on one of London's busiest trading streets. Originally used as a milking parlour, it  became a depot before being knocked down in the 19th Century. In 2011 developers took over the site and demolished the house to make way for the plush mansion which now sits in its place. At 8,139 square ft, it is on the market for £25million. A newly-built mansion that was constructed on the site of a former milking parlour in Mayfair has gone on the market for £25million . The house is decorated throughout with modern furnishings and plush carpets. Among its features is a private lift and guest cloakroom . A grand piano sits in the marbled hall on one of the floor's houses. A 14-piece dining table is also featured in the luxury dining room . An indoor swimming pool now takes the place of what once would have been a milking shed in the 18th and 19th Century . A cinema room is one of the many modern features in the property. It was built in 2011 after developers knocked down the original structure . Impressive artwork throughout the house adorns its walls. It is being sold for £25million by estate agents Wetherell and Knight Frank . An opulent 14-place dining table is found on the first floor of the luxury property which also has its own lift . London's milking parlours date back to Tudor times, with Farm Street serving as hub of agricultural trade for years. Cows were brought there from the grazing areas of Peckham, Holland Park and Hampstead heath and sold to local butchers. Alongside the parlours was an abattoir and pub, the Punch Bowl, which remains. Guy Ritchie and Madonna bought the pub while they were married and it quickly became a celebrity favourite. Mr Ritchie sold it in 2013 to the Alexander Langlands Pearse. Inside the modern mansion are four bedrooms including a master suite which occupies the entire second floor. The lower ground floors feature a swimming pool complex with mosaic-lined pool, steam room, gym, shower and changing facilities, kitchenette, guest cloakroom and media room. It also has a private lift, marble flooring, a sweeping spiral staircase and a dining room which can seat 14. Speaking of the property, Peter Wetherell, chief executive of Wetherell, said: 'This recently built house is an outstanding example of contemporary living in historic Mayfair at its very best. 'As the location of Mayfair’s dairy, the interesting and unusual history allowed for the construction of a house on a commercial depot site, without the usual restrictions of historic listing controls. 'The result is an open flowing family house providing spacious rooms and generous ceiling heights rarely found in historic Mayfair.' The house has four bedrooms which all come with their own en suite bathrooms and is set over four floors. It was built in 2011 . One of the four bedrooms in the house is finished with sleek white, grey and black furniture and soft furnishings throughout . Another of the guest rooms in the luxury mansion furnished in cream and peach.

"The National Trust has replaced antique furniture with beanbags at one of its historic homes in an ‘experiment’ which has enraged heritage experts. Furniture dating back to 1820 was moved from the library at Ickworth House in Suffolk earlier this year and replaced with four brown leatherette bean bags. The move was designed to encourage visitors to ‘dwell and take in the atmosphere’ in the room but it provoked fury from heritage expects who branded the move ‘misguided’. The National Trust has replaced antique furniture with beanbags in the library of Ickworth House, Suffolk . Now it has emerged that similar experiments will take place at nine other of its venues around the country. Art historian Bendor Grosvenor, whose blog post on his Art History News site about Ickworth sparked the controversy, told The Independent: ‘I suspect the hoo-ha about the beanbags may at least cause them rethink what they were going to do. The National Trust said the beanbag experiment was 'short-term' Pictured: Ickworth House, Suffolk . ‘I don’t think you’ll ever bring in a new audience by talking down to it. Experimentation and bringing in new audiences are marvellous but there are better ways of doing it by taking away things people might want to see. It’s patronising nonsense.’ The National Trust’s director of strategy, curatorship and external affairs Simon Murray told The Art Newspaper that the Trust ‘presents each house in context’ and that each is different and treated appropriately. He said: ‘We are not a museum that takes objects, shows them in a display case, shines a light on them and labels them’. But he said this meant that ‘many visitors find a vast array of objects in front of them, cast a cursory eye over them and don’t get a great deal from the experience.’ He said the beanbag experiment was a short-term arrangement which would not necessarily continue for the whole year. But he added: ‘Some of our staff think we should have used a rather different sort of seating and others think it is good as an experiment.’","Four brown leatherette bean bags placed in library at Ickworth House .

"Three people have been taken to hospital following a head-on collision between a vintage sports car and a 4WD. The crash happened on Easter Sunday night on Warringah Road in Frenchs Forest, northern Sydney at a traffic light intersection. The 1973 E-Type Jaguar, which is thought to be worth over $120,000 was completely written off when it came up against the Toyota Kluger on their Sunday drive. A 1973 E-Type Jaguar has been involved in a crash with a Toyota Kluger . Nobody was hurt in the collision, however all three adults were taken to hospital as a precaution. NSW police told Daily Mail Australia that they are still investigating the circumstances surrounding the devastating collision. The photos of the crash were posted to the NSW Traffic and Highway Patrol Command's Facebook page, where car enthusiasts were quick to sympathise with the owner of the classic Jaguar. The crash occurred on Warringah Road in Frenchs Forest . 'That is a really, really rare car. They go for over $120,000. I feel sorry for the owner,' one Facebook user said. 'How could a modern car hit a classic car - I just don't know. We need to admire and respect drivers that take the time to restore and drive classic cars. It's part of our motoring history,' another commenter said. 'As a car enthusiast I died a little,' one user said. The $120,000 Jaguar was completely written off in the crash . The crash comes after police warned motorists to obey the road rules over the Easter long weekend or risk 'ending up in custody, hospital or the morgue'. Extra police are on duty during the annual Operation Tortoise, which sees the force crack-down on drink-driving and reckless driving.","Three adults taken to hospital after head on collision at Frenchs Forest .

"Geoff Barrow has accused streaming services of giving music away, saying his band Portishead were paid just £1,700 despite getting 34million plays . The founder of rock band Portishead has waded into the debate over music streaming, saying that he received just £1,700 in royalties despite his songs being played 34million times. In a series of tweets Geoff Barrow, Portishead's founder and instrumentalist, attacked Spotify, YouTube, Apple and 'especially' Universal Music for selling his music cheaply. He added that he has nothing against streaming, but wants musicians to be paid more, and says it is hurting young talent, stopping people from establishing themselves on the scene. Barrow, who also runs the Invada record label, told The Times: 'You used to write a piece of music and people paid you to listen to it. 'Yet for younger artists who just want to play rock and roll, by the time they get to a major label, all their rights will have been sold away. 'There will be not much meat left on the bone. You see these huge deals but will smaller bands be able to buy a Ford Galaxy to go on tour in if this isn't sorted out?' Artists have long railed against the low royalties paid from streaming companies, leading to Jay-Z launching his own Tidal service this month, promising bigger returns for musicians. Pop megastar Taylor Swift and Thom York, frontman of indie rockers Radiohead, have also pulled their music from services such as Spotify in protest. However, record companies have been quick to upload their music on to these platforms to prop up the collapse in CD sales after music moved online. Barrow, who heads up record label Invada as well as playing in Portishead (pictured), said he was not opposed to streaming technology, but was concerned young artists were getting a poor deal . Streaming companies have also defended their practices, saying they offer artists a fair price in an age where music can be easily accessed for nothing. Rihanna, Madonna, Beyonce, Usher, Daft Punk, Arcade Fire, Jack White and Kanye West banded together to help launch Jay Z's $20-a-month Tidal streaming service last month, which aims to offer artists a better deal. The membership-based service  will operate in a similar format to Spotify, providing music and exclusive videos that users can stream on computers, tablets and smartphones or listen to offline. The ongoing row between artists, music labels and streaming companies lead to Jay Z launching his own service, Tidal, which aims to give musicians a better deal . Backed by a host of musicians such as Arcade Fire, Daft Punk, Madonna, and Alicia Keys, Jay Z plans to charge £20-per-month for the service, and will give the artists a bigger share . Unlike Spotify there isn't a free service and users will have to pay $9.95 for standard sound quality or $19.99 for 'lossless high fidelity sound quality.' Tidal streams at 1,411 kilobytes per second - well above the 320 for premium subscribers of Spotify, which offers lower levels for free users. Speaking at the launch event, Alicia Keys said: 'Our mission goes beyond commerce, it goes beyond technology. Our intent is to preserve music's importance in our lives.'","Geoff Barrow said streaming services and record labels give music away .

"Three hours after giving birth to her longed-for baby girl, Lianne Hindle lay dead in the same hospital bed. The mother-of-four suffered a cardiac arrest at the scandal-hit North Manchester General Hospital in December. The 37-year-old's death came just months after three babies and one mother died at the maternity unit. The deaths, along with those of four babies and two mothers at the Royal Oldham Hospital prompted an investigation. Today Ms Hindle's partner Chris Barnes and his sister Karen have called for action to prevent further tragedies. Chris Barnes, whose partner Lianne Hindle died three hours after giving birth to their daughter Poppy (pictured with brothers Zac and Louie), is calling for action to prevent further tragedies at North Manchester General Hospital . The 40-year-old father-of-four said: 'Something has to be done. It isn't right. 'This is still happening. Maternity units are supposed to be the safest places to have babies.' Mr Barnes, who suffers with cerebral palsy, has been left to care for the couple's three-month-old daughter Poppy, and her three brothers, Morgan, 15, Zac, nine, and Louie, seven. North Manchester General and the Royal Oldham Hospital called in independent experts to review its maternity units after the spate of 10 deaths in the eight-month period from December 2013 to July last year. Ms Hindle, from Bury, died in December - her death falling outside the scope of the investigation. She went into labour at almost 35 weeks pregnant, in the early hours of December 15. The expectant mother was scheduled to give birth at St Mary's Hospital, which has a specialist intensive care baby unit, after suffering two previous stillbirths, and three premature pregnancies. But she was taken to North Manchester General by ambulance instead, after it became clear she was going to give birth before she could get to St Mary's. This is the only picture Ms Hindle's family have of her holding daughter Poppy . Immediately after welcoming baby Poppy shortly after 2am, Mr Barnes said his partner appeared 'fine', holding the newborn and naming her. But just an hour later,  she started to feel unwell  - complaining that she was 'red hot'. Ms Barnes described how Ms Hindle started to look 'deathly white', and felt cold and clammy to touch, before her eyes began rolling back in her head. Her blood pressure and heart rate plummeted as her condition deteriorated and she died at around 6am after suffering a cardiac arrest. Ms Barnes said the family has concerns about the care Ms Hindle received, claiming she was left alone with a student midwife following the birth, once the placenta had been delivered. 'Lianne was repeatedly talking of how red hot she was, asking for a fan and the windows to be opened,' Ms Barnes said. 'The student midwife said that was normal after having a baby and wafted her with a sick bowl. 'I didn't see Lianne's temperature taken once.' Ms Barnes claimed at one point, a member of staff came into the room and asked the student midwife: 'Who are you supposed to be with?' To which the student replied, ""exactly"", Ms Barnes said. Ms Hindle's family said no one from the hospital had contacted them since her death. Ms Barnes added: 'That makes us feel that she just wasn't important to them.' Mr Barnes, who suffers cerebral palsy, has been left to care for the couple's four children, Zac, nine, Morgan, 15, three-month-old Poppy, and Louie, seven . A spokesman for The Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust said: 'Our condolences go out to the family in this tragic case. 'Lianne was diverted to us as an emergency on the way to another hospital. 'She was not previously known to our maternity service and while her baby was delivered safely, tragically Lianne subsequently died. 'We are unable to comment further as this case has been referred to the coroner and has not yet been heard. 'We deliver 10,000 babies each year and would like to reassure families about the safety of maternity services at our hospitals, but if any expectant mother has a concern they can contact their designated midwife to discuss this.' Mr Barnes said: 'Lianne had always dreamed of a little girl. She was a strong character and loved her family. Her death has shocked and devastated us. It doesn't seem real. 'The boys have been pretty resilient but Louie is a mummy's boy and recently has been waking up in the night and crying out for her. That has been hard to take.' A date for her inquest has not yet been set. An investigation was launched at the North Manchester General Hospital after the deaths of three babies and a mother at the hospital between December 2013 and July last year. The probe also looked at the deaths of four babies and two mothers at the Royal Oldham Hospital over the same time period . A catalogue of failings have been uncovered at two NHS hospitals after seven babies and three mothers died there in the space of just eight months. Independent investigators were called into Royal Oldham after the deaths of four babies and two mothers, and North Manchester General after the deaths of another three babies and one mother. Lisa Parkisson, 35, died at Oldham Royal 48 hours after giving birth in April this year, while newborn Thomas Beaty died at the same hospital in June after doctors pushed him back into the womb during birth. A summary of the investigation, which was kept secret from the families of the dead until now, has been seen by MailOnline and found 'notable absence of clinical leadership' in the maternity wards, and a 'failure to adequately plan care' in a number of cases. Lisa Parkisson, 35, (left with son Zac) died 48 hours after giving birth at Oldham Royal in June last year. Thomas Beaty (right) died from  at the same hospital after doctors forced him back into the womb . A team of independent investigators also found risk management was 'below standard' in some cases - though there were no apparent 'deficiencies in care' in the deaths of the three mothers. The report noted that several of the mothers were obese or morbidly obese, which can lead to complications, but that national guidelines for treating overweight people were not followed. Officials also criticised the hospital's own investigations, saying the root cause of the deaths was not always identified, opportunities to learn lessons were not always picked up, and that some recommendations were too general and difficult to measure. All of the deaths are believed to have occurred between December 2013, and July last year. Pennine Acute is in the process of producing an action plan based on the recommendations from the findings. They include strengthening clinical leadership and risk management, making sure enough staff are on duty to ensure safety and reviewing the process for employing temporary locum doctors. Gill Harris, chief nurse at Pennine Acute, said last week: 'The Trust is always keen to learn and to improve care. We commissioned a review by experts from outside the Trust to look at the details of a small number of maternity cases at our hospitals. Independent investigators found failings in care and hospital leadership at Oldham Royal following the deaths of four babies and two mothers there in eight months . 'We are now considering that report and are developing a number of actions as a result to make some improvements to ensure we continue to provide the best quality of care for our patients. 'We deliver 10,000 babies each year and would like to reassure families about the safety of maternity services at our hospitals, but if any expectant mother has a concern they can contact their designated midwife to discuss this.' A spokeswoman for the Care Quality Commission, the health regulator, said: 'CQC is aware that Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust has recently initiated an external review into its maternity services and we are in close liaison with the trust, NHS England and local CCG regarding the review findings.'","Lianne Hindle suffered a cardiac arrest at North Manchester General .

United go into the clash against City ahead of them in the Premier League table for the first time since the Sir Alex Ferguson era, and victory at Old Trafford could see them move four points clear of Manuel Pellegrini's side in fourth. With seven games to go, the two Manchester sides are battling out with Arsenal for second place in the Premier League, and hoping to stave off any potential surge into the Champions League positions from the likes of Liverpool and Tottenham, who linger in fifth and sixth respectively. City have won on their last three visits to Old Trafford - the famous 6-1 in 2011/12, 2-1 in 2012/13 and 3-0 last season - which is a run Rooney and Co will be desperately hoping to bring to an end.

While midfielder Ashley Young is also desperate to bring an end to their wretched recent run against Manchester City. He said: 'We know it will be tough but as long as we can play the way we have shown, especially in the last few games, and add to that, it's going to be a great game and hopefully we will get the three points. 'We want to keep the momentum going and the positive play. It would be nice (to finish above City) but we are just taking each game as it comes.

"CCTV footage of the devastating moment a man put his brother in a coma with a single punch has been released for the first time, with the brother responsible soon to learn if he will serve prison time. Downing Centre Local Court showed the security footage of the violent altercation between Irishman Barry Lyttle and his younger brother, Patrick, during a sentence hearing on Wednesday. Prosecutor Alex Poulos called for Barry, from Belfast in Ireland's north, to face a full-time jail term as it was the 'only appropriate sentence' after the violent incident in Sydney in January. Scroll down for video . After being pushed by Patrick Lyttle, his brother retaliates with a single punch (left) which causes his brother to fall to the ground, his head snapping back and body crumpling (right) Barry Lyttle has been charged with grievous bodily harm and has pleaded guilty to the charge . Magistrate Graeme Curran said a jail sentence was likely, explaining 'the issue is whether or not I suspend a prison term'. Barry could spend up to two years in a Sydney jail, despite his brother's calls for the charges to be dropped. On Thursday, security footage was shown for the first time, revealing the details of the distressing altercation outside Hugo's Lounge in Sydney's Potts Point when Patrick received a single blow to the head during an argument with his brother Barry. In court on Thursday, Patrick comforted his inconsolable brother as they watched the footage. Before the fight the brothers, who had only been reunited for a holiday in Australia for a matter of days, are seen chatting jovially and patting each other on the back affectionately. But after leaving the bar a fight escalated quickly. The court saw footage of the brothers standing nose-to-nose, exchanging some tense words. As Barry starts to walk away from the argument, Patrick pushes his big brother roughly. Patrick was treated by paramedics at the scene where he was found in a pool of blood and vomit on January 3 . Patrick Lyttle (middle) has called on charges against his brother Barry (left) to be dropped . The brothers from Belfast in Ireland (pictured here as children) went on a night out on January 3 in Kings Cross . Mr Lyttle pleaded guilty after the crown declined to downgrade the charge against him . The Irishman could learn his fate as soon as Thursday afternoon when the matter returns to court for a possible sentencing hearing . A split second later, Barry retaliates with a brutal punch to Patrick's head. It is a distressing scene as Patrick's head snaps back from the force of Barry's blow. His body buckles beneath him and he crumples to the ground, his head slamming against the pavement. As Patrick lies unresponsive on the ground, a clearly-distressed Barry immediately rushes to his brother's side, frantically trying to revive him. Patrick nearly lost his life after suffering traumatic head injuries. He was found by emergency services in a pool of blood and vomit, and remained in a coma at Sydney's St Vincent's Hospital for six days after the January 3 altercation. Patrick says he has since made a 'fantastic recovery.' Barry pleaded guilty to recklessly causing grievous bodily harm, whilst his brother called for the charges to be dismissed. Barry Lyttle (pictured left) has pleaded guilty to causing his brother Patrick (right) grievous bodily harm . The Lyttle family has previously said they believe the charge against Barry (centre) should be dropped . Patrick Lyttle (right) said he had made a 'fantastic recovery' On Thursday, Patrick delivered an impassioned victim's statement, pleading for Barry to be spared a prison sentence and for the family to be allowed to return to Ireland together to 'heal'. 'When my family is healed I will be healed,' Patrick Lyttle told the court. 'It has been an awful ordeal for me but everyone can see it has been for Barry too. 'Victims often want to see deterrence. But everyone can see how much my brother has suffered.' Patrick also pointed out their father Oliver's health has greatly suffered as a result of the trauma. Their father was in Australia with the two men on what had intended as a trip of a lifetime, but has become a nightmare. Barry Lyttle is pictured arriving at court with his brother, Patrick, and his girlfriend, Patricia last week . 'He doesn't want to go home without his two sons,' Patrick said. Patrick asked the court to consider allowing Barry to return to Ireland so the brothers can embark on a career in youth work, telling young people their story to warn of the dangers of violence. Barry's lawyer Chris Watson said his client was remorseful, unlikely to re-offend and of good character. The 33-year-old will be sentenced in Sydney's local court, where the maximum jail term is two years, rather than the district court, where people could face up to 10 years for that offence. Barry Lyttle's barrister Chris Watson said the punch was a 'very emotional, spur of the moment act' that immediately followed being aggressively attacked by his brother, and that Barry Lyttle had immediately shown 'an extreme level of contrition and remorse', according to the Sydney Morning Herald. Any animosity between the two has since gone and they walked from court together on Thursday, as they have done at earlier appearances. Barry will return to court for sentencing on April 24.

"Brendan Rodgers has criticised Raheem Sterling’s advisor, suggesting that the player is being manipulated by outside forces and that he would be inclined to stay at Liverpool if left to make a decision alone. With Liverpool losing 4-1 at Arsenal on Saturday and seeing their hopes of qualifying for the Champions League next season effectively ending, Rodgers made veiled criticisms of the player’s agent, Aidy Ward, after the televised interview Sterling gave last week, in which he admitted he was flattered by Arsenal’s interest in him. Rodgers also revealed that he has sat down with Sterling since that TV interview and to tell him that his best interest would be served by staying at the club for now, even though there may come a time when he does leave. Raheem Sterling  goes past Mathieu Flamini during the Barclays Premier League match at the Emirates . Sterling has reject a contract extension worth £100,000 a week and has just two years left on his deal at the end of this season, but Rodgers said: ‘I’ve had a good chat with him. I have given him my opinion on it. This is a young kid who has been advised to do something else. A 20-year-old boy does not pick up the phone to ask to speak to the BBC. ‘You don’t do that; him in particular. He just wants to play his football. But of course if he’s asked to do that by other parties then that’s what he’ll do. ‘In the modern game it is obviously something that frustrates us all but it is the market and where football is at. In fairness to Raheem, I brought him in from the youth team and the reserves and I know that a big part of this is actually nothing to do with him.’ Sterling has rejected a contract extension worth £100,000 a week and has just two years left on his deal . ‘In my time in coaching there are a lot of very, very good agents. The only thing I would say on Raheem’s situation is that anyone can see that for his football development and financially, Liverpool Football Club is the best place for him. There is absolutely no question of that. ‘I think he enjoys being at Liverpool and loves playing for Liverpool and knows he is privileged to play in front of Liverpool supporters. As a kid he knows the opportunity is there for him to improve as a footballer. What that will be in five, six, seven years time is different. But for this moment of his career and life, he really enjoys it. He has said that himself. He has talked very openly about loving his football and playing for a great club like Liverpool.’ Sterling said he was flattered by Arsenal's interest in signing him should he leave Liverpool this summer . Sterling grapples with Arsenal defender Hector Bellerin during Liverpool's defeat to the Gunners . Rodgers admits that the task may have become more difficult now that Liverpool’s hunt for a top four spot seems to have come to an end but remains confident that he can persuade the player to extend his deal . ‘As long as the player can see the ambition of the club. We all know the reality of where the game is at in this country. There are bigger spenders than ourselves and more experienced squads – the model at Liverpool is different. ‘Of course players will want to look at possibilities when that time comes. But when you talk specifically about Raheem – because he’s got huge potential but there’s still a bit to go - then I think Liverpool is the best place for him. Sterling competes with Laurent Koscielny during a defeat which all-but ends Liverpool's top four chances . ‘He has had the opportunity to play, which is key for a young player. It is the model of Liverpool, which the owners have put in, where they want to create the world class talent. He has just turned 20. There is still a long way for him to go and he has a lot of potential. I believe that will be developed over the next coming years at Liverpool. ‘It is the job of his advisors to look at the possibilities might be beyond that. But he has two and a half years left and won’t be going anywhere in the summer – that’s for sure. And we’ll sit down again with the club and his representatives to hopefully find the solution in the summer.’ Sterling is taken to ground by Arsenal's German defender Per Mertesacker during the game in north London . Rodgers went out of his way to play the player, who missed an easy first half opportunity to put Liverpool ahead but who was their most consistent threat and won them the penalty they scored. Rodgers said: ‘There was no change in him. I thought he was excellent today, our best player. He was aggressive in his running, pressed the ball well, he won the penalty. He was very direct and strong. ‘This is a kid that is really focused on his football. There’s no change and he works hard every single day. And you see from today, he just wants to play his football. The kid for me gives me everything the way he trains and plays.’","Brendan Rodgers has hit out at those advising Raheem Sterling .

"On the pitch this season, Chelsea have been hitting their targets... and off it, Eden Hazard and three of his Blues team-mates have been doing the same. Taking part in Audi's football challenge, Hazard and Nathan Ake paired up to take on Loic Remy and Willian in a head-to-head challenge for the car manufacturers. In round one, the Chelsea stars aim to fire balls into the boot of a car from close range, with Hazard and Ake securing the points with a 5-3 win. One of the challenges the Chelsea players were set was to sink balls into convertible Audi's from long range . 17-goal man Eden Hazard and youngster Nathan Ake took on Blues' team-mates Loic Remy and Willian . From there, they take to a makeshift tennis court, where the net is replaced by a £127,000 Audi R8 V10 plus, and the players must play over the top of it. Once again, it is 17-goal man Hazard and his partner Ake who come up trumps, winning the decider to take a 6-0 lead after the first two rounds. It is in the final game that most points are won, as the players shoot from long range aiming to sink their footballs through the top of a convertible Audi. Hazard poses next to a £127,000 R8 V10 plus Audi, which played the part of tennis net in one challenge . The final challenge involved the players shooting at cars from long range, with Remy and Willian winning .

"A freezer trawler has sunk in a peninsula off the coast of Russia, killing at least 56 crew members. A massive rescue operation involving more than 1,300 people is now underway after the ship, carrying an international crew of 132, sank in the Sea of Okhotsk in just 15 minutes. Rescued crew members reported that the ship, called the Dalny Vostock, was unstable because of empty fuel tanks and a lack of ballast as it sailed through the Kamchatka Peninsula. The Russian freezer trawler, called the Dalny Vostok, that sank while carrying 132 crew members at 4am on Thursday morning local time. At least 54 bodies have been recovered in the huge rescue operation . Map showing the location of the disaster. There are 13 members of the crew are still missing after the trawler tipped over when a fishing net was pulled in, a regional governor told Russian television on Thursday . It tipped over when a fishing net weighing 80 tons was pulled in, said Oleg Kozhemyako, acting governor of the nearby Sakhalin region. Kozhemyako's comments on Russian television came after the federal Investigative Committee said it was considering all possible causes for the sinking, but it was likely that the trawler hit 'an object' floating in the sea, perhaps drifting ice. More than 26 fishing boats in the area have helped to rescue members of the crew, but have also recovered 56 bodies. The disaster happened at around 4am local time, and the trawler did not send any distress signals before it sank, the Interfax News Agency said. Early reports added that the Dalny Vostok sank in just 15 minutes after its engine compartment had been flooded. So far 63 people have been rescued, with survivors suffering from hypothermia and other injuries being airlifted to hospital. At the latest count there are 13 people still missing. An emergency services representative told local media that two of the bodies were found on Thursday evening - one in a lifeboat 105 kilometres (65 miles) away, and the other in the water nearby. Those saved had managed to get into lifeboats and some had put on wet suits. The Russian Emergencies Ministry sent an Mi-8 helicopter with rescuers and doctors aboard to treat and transport rescued crew members to hospitals in the city of Magadan, it said on its website. A rescuer uses a satellite phone while onboard a helicopter as they fly over the Sea of Okhotsk scouring the waters for survivors. Around 1,300 fishermen and emergency staff are involved in the rescue operation . A Russian Emergencies Ministry ship looks for survivors after the Dalny Vostock sank. Temperatures in the water can dip to as low as -2 degrees celsius, and so far it is confirmed that 56 crew members have drowned . A telephone hotline for families of the crew has also been set up. Among the 132 crew members, 78 are from Russia, 42 from Myanmar and the rest from Latvia, Ukraine and Vanuatu. Pyotr Osichansky, president of the Far Eastern Association of Sea Captains, told Russian television that when the trawler last docked in Russia, in January, it had fewer than 70 crew members. The additional crew members were most likely picked up in Pusan, South Korea, and were working illegally, he said. The Sea of Okhotsk is the coldest sea in East Asia with the air temperature plummeting to -20 degrees Celsius in the winter months. Following the tragedy 63 people have been rescued, but the bodies of 56 sailors have been pulled from the freezing sea. Early reports say the trawler sank in 15 minutes when its engine room was flooded . Between October and April the area the area is 'constantly' covered with ice and there is very little rain, according to Encyclopedia Britannica. Survivors of the incident are reportedly being interviewed as well as the owners of the trawler, as the police start investigating the disaster. It is understood they are questioning whether there was a violation of safety procedures that led to more deaths, a report in Russia Today said. The 100-metre long trawler was built in 1989 and was equipped to freeze and can fish.","Trawler was carrying 132 crew members when it sank in Sea of Okhotsk .

"Frightened: Diana Doyle was plagued with cold calls . A firm linked to the sale of NHS patient data is offering details of eating disorder sufferers for just 12p a head, the Mail can reveal today. It has also offered to supply names of those suffering from stress, hair loss, dandruff, impotence and snoring. Even details of dieters and those who have had plastic surgery appear on the list of data for sale. The Mail has this week exposed companies that have secretly sold private financial and medical information without proper checks. Our investigation has revealed that: . The revelations have prompted probes by the Information Commissioner’s Office and the Direct Marketing Commission. A third investigation has been launched by the General Pharmaceutical council into Pharmacy2U, the UK’s biggest online pharmacy. The Mail revealed that Pharmacy2U had passed information on NHS patients to Alchemy Direct Media. The eating disorder data – passed to the Mail by a whistleblower – is being touted by a firm called Sequester, which is a business partner of Alchemy. Sequester is offering to sell information on people suffering from 43 different health conditions – from skin problems to insomnia and migraines. It claims to be able to identify those who have had plastic surgery, who smoke, wear glasses or contact lenses or have sensitive teeth. It also appears to offer details of which credit cards people have and which banks they use, as well as whether they have wills or health insurance. Such data is a goldmine for unscrupulous firms and criminals – who can use it to target vulnerable individuals and scam them over the phone. The whistleblower, who works in the data industry, said it was ‘madness’ that so much personal information was available to him and he had passed it to the Mail because he was worried about who else might have access to it. He said: ‘I am not registered with the regulators, I’m just a man who has worked in the industry at some point – and all this information is available to me. It’s absolute madness.’ The list of categories of data was contained in an email – seen by the Mail – from Sequester’s CEO Matthew Foy in which he described the information his firm was able to supply on its new database. At the top of the email, he writes: ‘Please do not distribute this list.’ The whistleblower said: ‘Imagine who else could get their hands on this. When I realised the level of information companies like Sequester have, that is when I knew how serious a problem this is. ‘We give our private health and financial details to people we trust, it is not fair they end up in the hands of people we don’t.’ He said he had been sent databases containing records of thousands of people’s pensions, investments and intimate health details. Dr Sarah Wollaston, who was the Tory chairman of the Commons health committee, said 'it's appalling' One of those on Sequester’s arthritis database is Diana Doyle from Wandsworth in London, who says she is ‘frightened’ her health details are being sold on. The grandmother, whose husband suffers from vascular dementia and is in a home, added: ‘I’m a very private person, I always say, “No thank you” when asked for my details. ‘I’m on my own at home now, so this is very frightening.’ She suspects her medical details were obtained from a survey she filled out in a catalogue. The 74-year-old has had to change her home phone number because she was getting so many nuisance calls. Dr Sarah Wollaston, who was the Tory chairman of the Commons health committee, last night said: ‘It is appalling that this kind of deeply personal and sensitive information is being traded. It is deeply worrying.’ When approached by the Mail, bosses at Sequester, which describes itself as a data controller, claimed they had never actually distributed any information on eating disorders or any of the other sensitive health information advertised in the email. Chief executive Mr Foy said the company did not hold such information and that his email had simply been saying that ‘this list is available on the market, that we could find it for a client’. ‘That does not necessarily mean it is available for release,’ he said. Watchdog will probe 'rogue' data firms who sold Mail's undercover reporters the financial data of 15,000 people . By Lucy Osborne . Two firms exposed by the Daily Mail as selling private information are to be probed by the industry watchdog. B2C Data sold our undercover reporters the financial data of 15,000 people – including details about their pension pots, incomes and investments. The second firm – Data Bubble – supplied our team with health details on 3,000 patients – such as whether they suffered from high blood pressure, arthritis or even bladder problems. The Direct Marketing Commission said it would probe both companies over claims that they had breached the rules on the sale of private data. It confirmed it was ‘formally investigating two companies following allegations in the Daily Mail that personal data was shared inappropriately and without the consent of users’. George Kidd, the chief commissioner, said: ‘The allegations in the Daily Mail are serious. People must be able to trust those with whom they share their data. We will look carefully at the roles and conduct of these two companies and advise the Direct Marketing Association on our findings quickly.’ The firms are already at the centre of a major probe by the Information Commissioner’s Office, which said the sale of such details was ‘on the face of it, a very serious breach of the Data Protection Act’. In meetings covertly filmed by our reporters, bosses at B2C Data were seen boasting of how they held thousands of details on every family in Britain. One, Gareth Doran, boasted: ‘We know what clothes they buy, what health products they buy, where they go on holiday, how many times they go on holiday, what income they’ve got, whether they have children.’ Data Bubble bosses offered to provide our reporters with the names of people with ‘different ailments’ for around 16p each. When asked how the information was obtained, the firm’s owner, hypnotherapist Joanne Clayton, said: ‘It could be people who bought mobility products from a catalogue … or even if they’ve been on holiday and they’ve ticked to say that they are needing help on the flight with regards to that, we can then identify that they actually have problems with mobility.’ Both companies sold the records despite not carrying out checks on the Mail’s bogus cold calling firm. Had they done so they would have quickly discovered it was simply a website and was not registered or regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. The announcement follows calls – led by David Cameron – for a clampdown on companies found guilty of selling personal data without consent. The Prime Minister suggested on Monday night that the law would be tightened if loopholes were being exploited by unscrupulous cold callers.","Sequester is offering details of eating disorder sufferers for 12p a head .

"One season soon, there will be more people watching each Premier League match live in the USA than in Britain. That is the confident expectation of broadcasting titan NBC, who hold the live rights to show matches Stateside and have more than doubled US interest in England’s elite division in the past two years. In 2012-13, some 13 million different Americans watched at least one top-flight English game live. Last season that was 32 million — or more than one in 10 people in the US. This weekend, for the first time, reflecting their boom product, NBC have transported their entire Premier League production from their HQ in Stamford, Connecticut, to England. NBC host Rebecca Lowe has helped to improve coverage of the Premier League in America . Star anchor Lowe was at Turf Moor to present Burnley's Premier League match against Arsenal . Lowe was joined by former Wimbledon midfielder Robbie Earle and retired MLS star Kyle Martino . Lifelong Crystal Palace fan Lowe is married to former Cheltenham manager Paul Buckle . Star anchor Rebecca Lowe was at Turf Moor for Burnley against Arsenal, joined by former USA midfielder Kyle Martino — a pin-up at LA Galaxy just before David Beckham — and fellow pundit Robbie Earle, now based in Los Angeles. The trio, plus pitchside analysts Lee Dixon and Robbie Mustoe, will also be at the Manchester derby at Old Trafford on Sunday and at Anfield for Liverpool-Newcastle on Monday. ‘The Premier League sells itself with its drama,’ says Lowe, 34, a former BBC and ESPN journalist snapped up to be the face of the PL in the USA by NBC two years ago. ‘But you can always enhance your coverage and that’s why we’re here this weekend.’ Lowe herself is a lifelong Crystal Palace fan, and had one eye on their stunning 4-1 win at Sunderland. As she told the LA Times recently, tongue in cheek, her support of Palace is not a sign that she can’t recognise good football. ‘I hope that people look at me and say she actually knows football because to be a Crystal Palace fan, you have to really want to be in football,’ she said. ‘It’s not easy being a Crystal Palace fan. I could pick United or City or Chelsea or Arsenal and I probably would have had a much happier childhood.’ Lowe now finds herself helping to influence the footballing choices of young Americans. ‘When I first moved to the States two years ago I hardly saw a [replica] Premier League shirt,’ she says. ‘Now they’re all over the place, and not just the big teams.’ Lowe was at Turf Moor to see Arsenal claim all three points thanks to a goal by Aaron Ramsey . Lee Dixon provided pitchside analysis for NBC as his former side defeated relegation candidates Burnley . NBC transported their entire Premier League production from their HQ in Stamford, Connecticut, to England for this weekend's round of matches . Every match is shown live in the USA. At 7am eastern time on Saturday, midday in Britain, NBC’s weekend PL broadcasting opened with a long shot of Turf Moor set against the Lancashire hills and Lowe describing how football has been played at this ground since 1883. ‘This country is so rich in history, it’s part of the appeal,’ says Lowe, a Londoner who is married to football manager Paul Buckle, who recently parted company with Cheltenham. ‘It’s important that we do tell our audience about [smaller clubs like] Burnley because otherwise it could all be Arsenal, United, City, Chelsea, Liverpool,’ Lowe says. ‘We’re passionate about educating and informing our audience.’ Martino says that when NBC won the rights to show games — for the three-year period, 2013-16, for $250 million (£167m) — some critics feared that showing every match ‘was going to be overkill … [but] what we’ve found is there is a demand for that level of consumption of this product’. The USA is the third most lucrative market now for the League in rights terms, among 84 separate overseas contracts covering 212 territories. Only Thailand, where broadcasters are paying $320m for the current three years and the Middle East (both £213m), offer richer pickings, so far. With the Premier League having recently sealed their record £5bn domestic TV deal for 2016-19 with Sky and BT, attention will now turn to all the overseas deals, to be brokered over the next year. India will be a key market, with a surging middle-class interest, while Malaysia, Indonesia and Brazil are seen as having room for growth, among others. All the overseas rights combined fetched £2.23bn for the League for the 2013-16 period (or £743m a year) with increases expected. The USA is high on the list of places the League want to continue building interest, not just to earn more TV cash but to provide the clubs with potentially lucrative markets. Burnley’s chief executive Lee Hoos, an American, told the Mail on Sunday on Saturday that his club’s merchandise sales in the USA have jumped 212 per cent this season simply by being in the League. Leaps of 150 per cent have been recorded in places as far flung as Korea and mainland Europe. Lowe would have been delighted with Crystal Palace's emphatic 4-1 league win over Sunderland . Burnley have benefitted from the American audience taking an interest in the Premier League, says Lee Hoos . Burnley chief Hoos, pictured withSportsmail's Nick Harris, insists his club's profile is high across the globe . Arsenal chief executive Ivan Gazidis has been impressed with NBC's coverage of the Premier League . ‘There are still people here in the UK who will say to me, “Where exactly is Burnley?”,’ he says. ‘Yet our profile has never been higher internationally.’ Arsenal’s chief executive Ivan Gazidis, who spent 16 years in MLS, said NBC’s coverage has been ‘transformative’ for the Premier League. He said in the recent past football was seen as ‘niche’ and ‘nerdy’ and ‘it was always cool to knock soccer … but when you get NBC coming into play you’re moving into the mainstream. It’s a sea change’. Three of the four most-watched Premier League games ever in the USA, including the No 1 match, Manchester United versus Arsenal in November, have been during NBC’s current deal. The biggest audience averaged 1.41m people — and that was before breakfast in many cities. The average audience in Britain for a Premier League match across Sky Sport and BT is little more than a million (and almost 500,000 in the US) and the biggest ever audience on Sky averaged below 3 million. United's win over Liverpool attracted 1.2 million on NBC cable and Spanish partner UNIVERSO combined . Manchester United's 2-1 win at the Emirates Stadium in November was the most-watched PL game in the US . Liverpool’s defeat by Manchester United last month had an average audience of 1.2 million on NBC cable and Spanish partner UNIVERSO combined. That made it the most-watched PL game screened before 10am in US history. The growth of the interest in America means numbers will swell there, with Martino believing phenomenal increases are likely. ‘NBC cover the Olympics, the NFL, they have been covering the big event for a very long time,’ he says. ‘It’s natural for them. It’s the same template [being used to market the Premier League]. ‘In the United States we talk about the NFL getting 19 million on a Monday night. That’s the bar set. And it’s not hyperbole to be ambitious — that’s what’s going to happen one day with the Premier League.’Liverpool’s defeat by Manchester United last month had an average audience of 1.2 million on NBC cable and Spanish partner UNIVERSO combined. That made it the most-watched PL game screened before 10am in US history. Jon Miller, NBC Sports’ president of programming, said: ‘The Premier League has a very passionate fan base here in the US. It’s also a youthful and affluent fan base as well, relative to other sports on television. ‘We have created a new “day part” in weekend morning television, where fans now come to our networks beginning at 7 in the morning and stay for 5-6 hours. It’s been a terrific partnership. ‘We believe that this is best soccer being played anywhere in the world and Americans gravitate towards the best when available.’","Rebecca Lowe has helped to enhance Premier League coverage in the US .

"Former Manchester United midfielder Eric Cantona has refuted claims he starred in a soft porn film, insisting You and the Night is a 'piece of art'.

"(CNN)Two deputies involved in the fatal attempt to arrest Eric Harris in Tulsa, Oklahoma, have been reassigned because of threats against them and their families, Sheriff Stanley Glanz said Monday in a news conference. The deputies were trying to arrest Harris when Reserve Deputy Robert Bates shot him. Unlike Bates, they are not charged with a crime, but have come under criticism for pinning Harris' head to the ground as he said, ""I'm losing my breath."" Police appear on video saying, ""F*ck your breath,"" apparently in response. Sheriff Stanley Glanz didn't specify the nature of the threats, but said he was ""very concerned"" for their safety and that of their families. He did not say what the deputies had been assigned to do. Another sheriff's official said the office has temporarily suspended operations of the agency's drug unit pending the review of the April 2 shooting of Harris following a weapons sting. Glanz indicated he has not yet decided how to proceed with a review of their actions, saying any action may be delayed until after the court case involving Bates has been settled. Bates is charged with second-degree manslaughter in Harris' death. Bates, who is free on $25,000 bond pending trial, shot Harris with his handgun after calling out, ""Taser, Taser,"" -- an indication he planned to use a stun gun to subdue Harris following a brief foot chase with the other deputies. Amid questions about his age -- 73 -- training and friendship with Glanz, Bates has said the shooting was accidental, and has apologized to the family. Lawyer releases training records for Tulsa deputy charged in killing . On Monday, Glanz also apologized to Harris' family. ""We are sorry Eric was taken from you,"" he said. But he said his office holds itself to the highest national standards of policing, and said Monday that the FBI had cleared the agency of any civil rights violations in the shooting. Bates is white. Harris was black. There have been allegations, first reported by the Tulsa World newspaper, that some of Bates' training records had been forged, or that he was unqualified to be serving on the force. The sheriff denied those allegations, saying he was certain Bates had qualified on the gun range and had extensive additional training. He said he was unaware of any forgery involving training records, and said he had not issued any training waivers for Bates, with whom he has been friends for more than two decades. But he said he supported prosecutor's decision to proceed with the case. He also said he had brought in a Dallas police consultant who had previously examined the office's policies and procedures for another look. Harris' family has said the shooting reveals ""a deep-seated problem"" within the department and has demanded justice, and changes in policy.","Deputies reassigned after threats, sheriff says .

"Manhattan's Fifth Avenue was a sea of bizarre hats today as people celebrating Easter took to the streets in outlandish headgear. Whether they had just emerged from Mass, or were only there to bare their bonnets, the quintessential Big Apple thoroughfare thronged with color on Sunday afternoon. Bunny ears, eggs and flowers were among the more conservative adornments festooning the heads of New Yorkers as they milled around in a loose gaggle centered on St Patrick's Cathedral. Mad hatters: These parader-goers, pictured in front of St Patrick's Cathedral on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue, were among the more conservative hat-wearers in the annual Easter parade . Flower power: One of these floral bonnets, pictured next to the Rockefeller Plaza, spouted bubbles into the sunny New York sky . Classic: Some churchgoers wore more somber and refined clothing to the Mass service at the Catholic cathedral . Feathery: This elaborate piece of headgear was sported by Doris Watlington at the Fifth Avenue parade on Sunday . One woman wore a large ship with blue sails on her head, while another sported an elaborate diorama based on the policies of Mayor Bill de Blasio. As well as Christians emerging from the service, led by Cardinal Timothy Dolan, Jews, Hindus, agnostics and atheists joined the masses for a walk on the mild, sunny day. Roses, industrial-style black goggles, as well as moving rabbit puppets also featured in the display, which didn't just involve humans. Mary Ann Smith, a local hatmaker who wore the ship-shaped hat, said: 'It's all about versatility'. Explaining the design, she said: 'It's about sailing to new heights,' said Smith. She also created headpieces for two friends, one topped with a massive butterfly and another with a tropical umbrella dripping with felt balls and anchored to a bird's nest. Just feet from the parade, the trio was tending to last-minute finishing touches, adding bobby pins to make sure the contraptions didn't topple. Kirsten Lee Sergeant, who wore the butterfly, said: 'It's Easter and I didn't want to be too garish. But then again, I do have a huge butterfly on my head!'

The 2015 Easter Parade bore little resemblance to the first one, which started in the 1880s as a strolling display of what prosperous New Yorkers wore to Fifth Avenue churches. In recent decades, the street gathering has morphed into a sort of costume circus - including pet dogs. A sizable subsection of dogs also sported elaborate Easter costumes, painstakingly designed by their owners - although some were so heavy they animals had to be carried around rather than walk. Carmen, a 4lbs Chihuahua, was not exactly happy with her getup. 'She didn't love this one because it's kind of heavy, and she won't walk in it. But if I carry her, she's fine,' said owner Melissa Mejias. A consultant to the city's Department of Education, Mejias dabbles in dog attire. She used a Simplicity pattern to sew Carmen's coat from one of her old shirts, adorning it with a flowery headband plus a necklace purchased from a company that makes accessories for tweens. And to make sure she didn't run off into the dense crowds, Mejias kept her on a bejeweled leash. As for Mejias, she wore her mother-in-law's old Easter hat to the parade, a dark red velvet one she'd pulled out of a closet. 'I'm carrying on that tradition,' said Mejias.

"A series of unpublished love letters from Mexican artist Frida Kahlo to her lover Jose Bartoli are expected to fetch upwards of $120,000 when the passionate missives go up for auction later this . During her marriage to muralist Diego Rivera, Frida penned the letters to Jose, a Catalan artist whom she met while she was recovering from surgery in New York. Their steamy correspondence began shortly after she returned to Mexico following the trip and continued throughout their secret three-year romance. 'I don’t know how to write love letters. But I wanted to tell you that my whole being opened for you,' then-39-year-old Frida wrote in October of 1946. Scroll down for video . Secret romance: Mexican artist Frida Kahlo (pictured) wrote passionate love letters to Jose Bartoli from 1946 and 1949 while she was married to muralist Diego Rivera . Enduring love: A collection of 25 of the unpublished letters will be auctioned off at Doyle New York on April 15 . She continued: 'Since I fell in love with you everything is transformed and is full of beauty… love is like an aroma, like a current, like rain.' The letters, 25 of which are headed to auction at Doyle New York on April 15, were written in Spanish between August 1946 and November 1949 and saved by Jose until his death in 1995. The archive of passionate messages, which comprise more than 100 pages, were passed down through different generations his family until they reached the current owner. According to Frida Kahlo biographer Hayden Herrera, the artist told Jose to sign his letters as 'Sonja' so that Diego would think they were from a woman if he came across them. High price: The letters (pictured) are expected to fetch upwards of $120,000 dollars . Pet names: Frida signed her letters to Jose 'Mara', which biographer Hayden Herrera explained is probably short for 'Maravillosa', a name Jose would call her . Creative couple: Jose, a Catalan artist, can be seen sitting at an easel as he works on a painting . Handle with care: This letter from the archive shows a stain on the right hand corner of the paper . Famous works: In this letter, Frida refers to 'Tree of Hope', a painting she created shortly after she met Jose . Diego, a muralist and a notorious Lothario, who once had an affair with Frida's younger sister Cristina, endured Frida's love affairs with women, but her relationships with other men would drive him to bouts of crazed jealousy. Meanwhile, Frida inscribed her letters with the name 'Mara', which Hayden explained is probably short for 'Maravillosa', a name Jose would call her. The collection also includes an original drawing of a sleeping cat, pressed flowers, ribbon, beads and drafts of a few of Jose's responses. Frida's candid messages to her lover shed light on her important paintings, an unknown pregnancy and her relationship with Diego, as well as her adoration for her Jose. Full package: The letters also include an original drawing of a sleeping cat and drafts of a few of Jose's responses . Sketch artist: Frida sent Jose this drawing of a tree in reference to 'The Tree of Life' City living: Frida posed for this photo in front of a skyline. She and Jose met when she was recovering from surgery in a hospital in New York . Long distance love: Frida ended this letter to Jose with a kiss, leaving behind a lipstick print of her mouth . Their secret affair began when Frida, who was left a partial cripple after a 1925 bus accident, was recovering from a spinal fusion performed in June, 1946 at New York’s Hospital for Special Surgery. Frida's sister Cristina was the one to introduce her to Jose, who moved to New York after fighting in the Spanish Civil War. They fell in love during his visits to the hospital and continued their long-distance courtship after she returned to Mexico. After Frida sold her 1946 painting Tree of Hope, which was inspired by her recent surgery, she wrote to Jose about his words influenced her creation. 'I remembered your last words and I began to paint,' she explained. 'I worked all morning and when I finished eating I kept on painting until there was no more light. But afterward I felt so tired and everything hurt.' An artist's life: Frida was photographed holding this statue while she stood in front of a blue cement wall . Inspired work: Frida sketched this drawing of a sleeping cat and sent it to Jose . Added images: This letter featured a picture of a women sleeping in a bed while another walked away . Last words: Frida ends this letter by telling Jose that she loves him . Epic romance: In this letter Frida told Jose she loves him the way that he is . In the painting one version of Frida lies in a hospital bed, while another depiction of herself sits proudly while holding a flag. While painting the piece, Frida inscribed 'Tree of Hope Keep Firm' a line of a song that she and Jose both liked. According to Hayden, Frida wrote in several of her letters to Jose that she had missed her period, in a way that suggested she was in some ways hoping to have his baby despite knowing it was nearly impossible because of her spinal injury. 'If I were not in the condition I am in now and if it were a reality, nothing in my life would give me more joy. Can you imagine a little Bartoli or a Mara?' she wrote. New images: Frida posed in her house for this photo take by French photographer Gisèle Freund . Full of life: Frida can be seen standing in her garden in Mexico in this image shot by Gisèle .

"Following Raheem Sterling's interview on Wednesday, in which he said he was not ready to sign a new contract at Liverpool, blogger David Tyrer of Live4Liverpool gives the view from Merseyside. While I hate to use social media as a gauge of opinions, Raheem Sterling’s interview didn’t go down well at all. It was ill-timed and, regardless of what Sterling and his agent hoped, he didn’t come across very well. Some of his answers only fuelled the fire really. I’m hoping that that wasn’t the whole point, as we’ve seen these sorts of situations engineered by agents before. The interview has almost certainly changed the way the fans feel about him. There will be a lot of fans that are of the opinion: ‘let him go’. Obviously, with the caveat that we get our money’s worth! Raheem Sterling returns to Liverpool training after the international break and shakes hands with manager Brendan Rodgers . Sterling risked angering Liverpool fans after he said in an interview he was not ready to sign a contract . Sterling trains ahead of the weekend's game with Arsenal . It’s always disappointing when a young player gets his head turned, but there’s a sense of ungratefulness about the whole situation, considering how the club has nurtured him and paid him well throughout. Personally, I think he has the potential to be worth so much more than the £100,000-a-week contract he’s turned down. But it’s only that: potential. At present, he’s arguably in the top five best young players in the world but, obviously at his age, he’s also prone to bouts of inconsistency and prolonged poor form. He hasn’t been great recently and was awful against Man Utd. Sterling has been linked with a move to Arsenal - the team he is preparing to face at the weekend . Raheem Sterling played for England in the 4-0 Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania . And while I’d be willing to see the club give him £100k a week – possibly £120k a week - the club shouldn’t do everything it can to keep him. Definitely not. Liverpool fans have a popular mantra: no player is bigger than the club. Admittedly, we stretch the rules for truly great players (Suarez, a recent example) but Sterling is nowhere near. If he wants out, I’m sure the club will handle it the way they have before. Frustration over Sterling’s situation has been building for a while, and many fans are now of the belief that if he wants to go he’s welcome to. Personally, I don’t like players holding the club to ransom. He has as much chance of winning trophies here as he does anywhere (other than money-rich clubs such as Chelsea or Man City). Sterling did not have his best game in a Liverpool shirt during the defeat at Manchester United . Liverpool fans have a mantra that no player is bigger than the club . If Sterling was to move to Arsenal then it would not go down well with Liverpool fans . But if he does end up going, he’s worth a lot more than many established players. His ability is so raw but he has almost limitless potential. At the moment, we’ve seen it in fits and starts but even so, he’s easily worth £25-30 million. If I was FSG, I’d hold any interested club to ransom, though – double it. But a move to Arsenal wouldn’t go down well. Perhaps better than if it was Chelsea or Manchester United, but honestly there’s little Arsenal can offer that we can’t. Sure, they’re more financially stable but what – in terms of trophies – do Arsenal have to show for the last 12 years? Sterling speaks to the BBC and reveals he is not ready to sign a new contract . I think we’re somewhat ahead on that front. Much like Alexis Sanchez, any move to Arsenal will be more about location than anything else. People have drawn comparisons with when Suarez wanted to leave for Arsenal, but the situation is different. Suarez says he wanted Champions League football and we weren’t offering that at that time. Not only that, but Suarez was an established top-class player at the time, one of the best in the world. Sterling is purely potential and, given all the club have done for him (cliched, as that sounds), it makes little sense. If he’s going to be nurtured into the world-class talent he can become, it won’t happen at Arsenal. It may not necessarily happen at Anfield either, but a manager like Brendan Rodgers will give him the best shot of improving to that level over the next two to three years.

"An 11-year-old retired K-9 officer took his last ride in a squad car in a heartwarming farewell held by fellow officers and residents celebrating his time on the force. Zeus, a German Shepherd, was honored in a grand procession in Connecticut on Wednesday before he was put down because of a severe degenerative hip disorder and declining health. The tribute for the police dog, who worked with the Ridgefield Police Department for eight years as a K-9 officer, began around 4.45pm and ended at the Ridgefield Veterinary Hospital. Scroll down for video . Zeus (pictured above), an 11-year-old retired K-9 officer was honored in a special tribute on Wednesday by the Ridgefield Police Department . The German Shepherd, who served eight years in the force, took his last ride in a cop patrol car during the grand procession held earlier this week (Zeus pictured with Officer Shawn Murray, his former partner and carer after he retired) On Wednesday, ahead of the procession, the police department wrote an emotional message about Zeus on their Facebook. 'Today is the day we have to say goodbye to our beloved K-9 Zeus,' they wrote. 'It is an extremely emotional day for all of us. 'He was a fellow officer and friend. He will be deeply missed but never forgotten. Our thoughts and prayers are with Zeus, Officer Murray and his family during this difficult time.'

Zeus was being taken to Ridgefield Veterinary Clinic (above) where he was to be euthanized . The vehicles traveled from the police headquarter and ended at the veterinary hospital. Residents held signs reading 'Thank you Zeus' and 'Zeus our hero during the afternoon. A flag was waved at half staff next to a draped black cloth at the department as Officer Shawn Murray, Zeus's former partner, pushed him in a cart during the tribute. 'This is an honor to be here for him during his last moments,' Chief John Roche told WTNH. 'The disease that had racked him had deteriorated to such a point where it was just so difficult for him to exist and continue on.' A flag was waved at half staff next to a draped black cloth at the department (pictured above) Chief John Roche (above) said during the tribute: 'This is an honor to be here for him during his last moments' In his eight-year career with the force, Zeus assisted with more than 250 narcotics arrest and also helped officers track down 50 missing or wanted individuals. The largest amount of narcotics he was responsible for seizing was ten pounds of marijuana in 2006, when he joined the force and was partnered with Officer  Murray who he continued to reside with after his retirement. The animal had to retire last May due to health issues, and for some losing Zeus is not only losing a coworker, but also a family member. 'He was in the yard when there were picnics,' Detective Scott Murray, Officer Murray's brother told WTNH. 'He played, he chased the ball, he did what all normal dogs do, what all normal family dogs do, except he had a job.' Following the special tribute, the police department wrote their final goodbye to Zeus. On Wednesday, the police department wrote an emotional goodbye to Zeus thanking him for keeping them safe . The police department said it was an honor to work beside Zeus. During his eight-year career with the force, the dog assisted with over 250 narcotics arrests (his badge pictured right) Ridgefield Police Department officers said: 'You will be dearly missed but never forgotten' 'Zeus, it is with tears in our eyes that we must say goodbye,' they wrote. 'You were a valued member of our team and only did great things. 'It was an honor to work beside you and knowing that you were there always helped put our minds at ease. 'We know you would not have hesitated to lay down your life for any of us if we were ever faced with a life threatening situation. You wore the Ridgefield Police badge with Respect, Pride and Dignity. 'Thank you for keeping us all safe over the years. You will be dearly missed but never forgotten.

"Earlier this week, Brazilian commuter Nelson Felippe was deeply offended by a scene he witnessed on a train platform. He proceeded to take a photo, and express his disapproval on Facebook, after which the image was shared more than 100,000 times in 24 hours. In the picture, taken on a train platform in Rio de Janeiro, two women hug and gaze into each others' eyes, but the source of his outrage soon becomes clear in a post that cleverly spoofs conservative attitudes. Brazilian man, Nelson Felippe posted this image, expressing his disapproval at the 'scene'. The viewer believes he is conducting a homophobic rant, as he mentions: 'They are challenging social conventions, and this can be dangerous' In his Facebook post, Felippe stated: 'I am not prejudiced, I think everyone does what they want out of your life. But I find it absurd that I should be forced to witness a scene like this. 'What one does in private is your business, but what you do in public concerns me yes. And I refuse to see a scene like this and consider it normal.' A man breaks safety regulations by standing with his foot on the yellow line . 'I do not wish ill of anyone, but people should be preserved. [They] are challenging social conventions, and this can be dangerous. Continuing with what the unknowing reader assumes at this point is a homophobic rant, the next part of the post starts to become confusing. 'If after a tragedy strikes, or worse, if someone dies, who will put the blame on who? On me? Worst of all is the example for children. Suddenly it becomes clear what Felippe, who works at the Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, is really warning against - with his tongue firmly in this cheek. 'What would happen to a child who sees this scene every day? 'Kids will think it's normal to wait for the subway on the yellow line. So, don't act like that guy over there. 'Follow the example of the girls.' It seems the Brazilian commuter was in fact observing a public transport safety regulation, which the man in the far top-right is clearly breaking. Felippe warns others not to follow in the delinquent man's footsteps. The post has received thousands of comments with users applauding his witty way of exposing homophobia.

"Meter Maids have a long history synonymous with the sandy beaches of Queensland's most sought-after holiday destination, but time may have run out for the Surfers Paradise bikini-clad icons. The 50-year tradition has split the Gold Coast community, with business leaders calling for the end of an era, The Sunday Mail reported. Started in 1965, Meter Maids were the brainchild of Gold Coast developer Bernie Elsey who introduced the initiative to stave off the bad publicity associated with newly installed parking meters. Scroll down for video . Local business owners have labelled Surfers Paradise Meter Maids as outdated and were no longer providing a service . The controversial move involved young women dressed in gold bikinis walking the main tourist strip and placing money into expired meters, according to the Surfers Paradise Meter Maids website. But local business owners say the group is no longer performing a public service as advancements in parking meter technology mean expiry times are not always displayed. They believe Meter Maids are violating the council's anti-touting laws by spruiking branded merchandise, which Gold Coast Chamber of Commerce president Peter Yared says makes the group a business now. 'I think it’s time they moved on,' he told News Corp. Started in 1965, Meter Maids were the brainchild of Gold Coast developer Bernie Elsey who introduced the initiative to stave off the bad publicity associated with the newly installed parking meters . Business leaders say it was time for them to move as they had became irrelevant now because parking meters were electronic . Gold Coast Chamber of Commerce's Peter Yared said the group were now a business . 'They no longer perform any service for the community... They don't do anything in the area except fleece tourists.' Mr Yared said Meter Maids were no longer relevant as parking meters were now electronic and they had not kept up with the changing times. 'We're trying to clean up the reputation of Surfers Paradise and a lot of the maids are foreign backpackers rather than local girls. It’s not a good look,' he said. But Surfers Paradise Meter Maids general manager Michael Yarwood told Daily Mail Australia the chamber of commerce was taking 'a terribly ill-informed position'. 'The tourists love and embrace the Meter Maids because they are quintessentially part of their Gold Coast and Surfers Paradise experience,' Mr Yarwood said. 'The great tragedy at Surfers Paradise is reflected in its concrete virility and the fact that the locals are staying away in droves. But Surfers Paradise Meter Maids general manager Michael Yarwood told Daily Mail Australia said the chamber of commerce was taking 'a terribly ill-informed position' Mr Yarwood said the Meter Maids were 'quinessentially' part of the Gold Coast and Surfers Paradise scene . He said they brought good memories for many people who had an idyllic beachside holiday at the destination . 'Until such time we are proud of this jewel in our tourism crown, we will continue to struggle to re-establish ourselves as the premier holiday destination in Australia.' Mr Yarwood said Meter Maids were the 'under-utilised resource' to help revamp the region. 'Meter Maids invoke in most people that wonderful memory of that beachside holiday in Surfers Paradise,' he said. 'We're calling for our future actually lies in past.

The defense had asked that the jury be allowed to consider a second-degree murder conviction, a request that the judge denied earlier Friday. Second-degree murder would have carried a sentence of 10 years to life in prison. Luna did not testify and the defense called just one witness, Luna's mother, Jennifer Luna. In her brief testimony, Jennifer Luna said her son lived with her parents after he was born and that his father is in jail. 'I wasn't there half the time,' she said. She also insisted from the witness stand that her boy would never hurt anyone intentionally. 'If my son did it, it wasn't on purpose. It wasn't meant to be. My son would never intentionally try to hurt somebody at all.' Dressed in a blue button-down shirt and a striped tie, Chancey Luna was stoned-faced when the jurors announced the guilty verdict. Satisfied: Donna Lane, left, the victim's mother, was pleased with the verdict, saying in reference to Luna that the 'naughty boy' will never hurt another family again .

Devastated: Sarah Harper, the girlfriend of the Australian murder victim, arrives for court in the trial of Chancey Luna Friday . Jennifer Luna, Chancey's mother picture din court Friday, testified that her son would never hurt someone intentionally . However, as he was being led in handcuffs and shackles out of the courtroom, the teenager told a swarm of reporters he was 'sorry.' Lane's parents and sister, who had read heartbreaking victim impact statements before the verdict was announced, expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the trial. 'This naughty boy is never going to do this to any other family,' Donna Lane told the media, according to Sydney Morning News. A co-defendant in the case, James 'Bug' Edwards Jr., now 17, testified that he was a passenger in the car when it swerved toward Lane, and Luna fired the shot. Edwards testified as part of a plea agreement in which a first-degree murder charge against him was reduced to being an accessory after the fact. Parents: Donna Lane, pictured left in court Thursday wiped tears from her face when prosecutors showed jurors a photo of the bloody T-shirt her son was wearing. Jennifer Luna (right) said her son lived with her parents and she was not there 'half the time' The car's driver, Michael Jones, now 19, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder as part of a plea bargain, but refused to testify for the prosecution. He is serving a life sentence with the possibility of parole. The doctor who performed the autopsy on Lane testified that even immediate medical attention would not have saved his life. 'Apart from a miracle, no,' said Dr. Inas Yacoub, a forensic pathologist with the state medical examiner's office. Yacoub testified that a .22-caliber bullet was recovered from Lane's body. Star-crossed lovers: Luna and his American girlfriend, Sarah Harper, had returned from a trip to Australia just two days before he was gunned down while out jogging . Torn apart: Lane, from Melbourne, Australia, was visiting his girlfriend, Sarah Harper, and her family in Duncan when he was killed . 'Despite being small, it damaged vital structures and caused significant bleeding,' Yacoub told jurors, striking two major blood vessels, puncturing both lungs and breaking two ribs. The victim's mother, Donna Lane, wiped tears from her face when prosecutors showed jurors a photo of the bloody T-shirt her son was wearing. Lane and family members also wept during testimony by witnesses who tried to comfort Lane as he lay dying. Lane, from Melbourne, Australia, was in Oklahoma on a college baseball scholarship. He was a catcher and preparing for his senior year at East Central University in Ada and was visiting his girlfriend and her family in Duncan when he was shot.","Oklahoma jury convicted 17-year-old Chancey Allen Luna of first-degree murder in 2013 killing of Christopher Lane .

"A giant supervoid 1.8 billion light-years across may be responsible for a mysterious ‘Cold Spot’ in the universe. The theory was proposed by astronomers seeking to understand what is causing this larger-than-expected cold area. If confirmed, the supervoid would be the largest single structure ever found by humanity. Hawaii scientists say a supervoid may account for an anomaly in the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) of the universe, shown bottom right. In 2004 astronomers first found the 'Cold Spot' - a region 20 per cent less dense than elsewhere - and may now have an explanation for its formation . The research, published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, was carried out by the Institute for Astronomy at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. The Cold Spot was first discovered by astronomers in 2004 when they were examining a map of the radiation left over from the Big Bang - the cosmic microwave background (CMB) - made using Esa's Planck telescope. In the map, the universe is fairly evenly distributed, apart from in this one area. The huge unexpected region contains about 20 per cent less matter than other regions of the universe and about 10,000 less galaxies. While other sparse regions have been discovered, nothing on this scale has been found before. ‘Statistically, we are very confident that the supervoid is there,’ Dr András Kovács, who was involved in the study, told MailOnline. He said that the supervoid appears to be ‘roughly spherical’, and it may even contain a ‘significant substructure’ at its centre; a void within a void. A supervoid is not empty, but rather a region of space that has less matter than other parts of the universe. For this reason it can ‘sap’ the energy of light that is passing through it. To explain how that works, imagine the void to be a hill. As light enters the void and travels towards its middle, it can be said to be climbing the hill, using up energy. Once it passes the centre, it would begin ‘descending’ the hill and regain the energy it expended to get there. But as the universe is expanding, by the time the light gets to the centre, its route out has become ‘shallower’ - or less dense. This means it cannot regain as much energy as it lost initially and leaves the void with less energy, therefore a longer wavelength, which corresponds to a colder temperature. The different is marginal - typically about 70 nano-Kelvins - but it is enough to stand out when the entire cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) of the universe is measured. The supervoid is thought to be causing a 'less-dense' region of the universe (illustration of empty space shown). At 1.8 billion light-years across it would be the biggest object ever found. But some 'exotic physics' is also needed to explain what's happening . The huge unexpected Cold Spot region, shown, contains about 20 per cent less matter than other regions of the universe, and about 10,000 less galaxies. While other sparse regions have been discovered, nothing on this scale has been found before . The original theory was that the Cold Spot originated from the Big Bang, and was a rare sign of 'exotic physics' that our current models of the universe could not explain. This new theory, however, suggests otherwise. Previous attempts to find a void at the distance of the Cold Spot were unsuccessful, but this latest study suggests it is actually a foreground object, three billion light-years from Earth. According to lead researcher Dr Istvan Szapudi, the object - if confirmed - would be ‘the largest individual structure ever identified by humanity.’ The team gathered data using Hawaii’s Pan-Starrs1 (PS1) telescope on Haleakala, Maui, and Nasa’s Wide Field Survey Explorer (Wise) satellite. The findings by the researchers were made using Nasa’s orbiting Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (Wise) telescope (artist's illustration shown), which was launched on 14 December 2009, and Hawaii’s Pan-Starrs1 (PS1) telescope on Haleakala, Maui . However, the supervoid can only account for about half of the entire Cold Spot, suggesting there might still be some exotic physics at play. The researchers note, though, that it is ‘very unlikely’ that the supervoid and the Cold Spot being in the same location are a coincidence. They are continuing to study the void with improved data from PS1, and from the Dark Energy Survey being conducted with the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile.","Hawaii scientists say a supervoid may account for a cosmic anomaly .

"Hassan Munshi, one of two teenagers feared to have crossed into Syria to join ISIS, is believed to be a relative of Hammaad Munshi (pictured) The families of two teenage boys who are thought to have traveled to Syria are 'in a state of profound shock' and deeply worried about the safety of their 'ordinary Yorkshire lads'. The boys who have been named as 17-year-olds Hassan Munshi and Talha Asmal are believed to have traveled to the embattled country after heading to Turkey on March 31. Hassan is supposedly related to Hammaad Munshi, who was arrested by counter-terrorism police at the age of 15 back in 2006. He was later convicted over his role in a brutal plan to murder non-Muslims,The Times reported. A statement released on behalf of the two families said: 'Both families are devastated by the events of the last few days and in particular, we are extremely concerned about the safety and well-being of our loved ones. 'Our number one priority is to get Hassan and Talha back home with their families and we implore anyone who may have any information whatsoever to get in contact with the police. 'Naturally, we are in a state of profound shock and are trying to come to terms with the predicament we find ourselves in and we hope and pray that no other family finds itself in our situation.' The pair from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, have not been in contact with their families for several days and cannot be reached on their mobile phones. Hassan's alleged relative Hammaad was only 15-years-old when he joined a terrifying Islamic State faction who were targeting the Royal Family. Hammaad was arrested on his way home from a chemistry exam in 2006 and found with two bags of ball-bearings - key material for a suicide vest. He was locked up for two years under the Terrorism Act in 2008. The statement added: 'These were just two ordinary Yorkshire lads who enjoyed the things that all young people enjoy at their age. 'Both Hassan and Talha had a promising future as an apprentice and an A-level student respectively, and we are praying they will be back with us soon and are able to realise that future. 'We would implore all parents to be extra vigilant, although as we found, it's near impossible to know your children have been groomed and brainwashed. 'Syria is a frightening war-torn place and we need to urgently educate our young children about the dangers posed by those who prey on impressionable teenagers.' The Times now reports that the two 17-year-old boys told their relatives they were going on a school trip - but instead used the Easter holidays as a 'window of opportunity' to flee Britain. They are thought to have boarded a Thomas Cook flight from Manchester Airport to Dalaman in Turkey on March 31, said West Yorkshire Police. Both families have reported the boys missing to police although British authorities now fear that the pair have managed to cross into Syria from Turkey. Scroll down for video . 'Seeking jihad': Two teenage boys from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, are believed to have fled to Syria to join Isis militants, seen here taking control of the Yarmouk refugee camp in Damascus . A family friend said they were in a state 'of total disbelief' and they were 'broken and inconsolable'. The south Dewsbury area has been linked to a number of extremist plots and was home to the ring-leader of the London bombings on July 7, 2005, Mohammad Sidique Khan. According to The Times, a member of one of the families said: 'We don't want to talk.' Assistant Chief Constable Mark Milsom, from West Yorkshire Police said: 'We are extremely concerned for the safety of these two boys and would urge anyone with information to come forward and speak to us. 'Syria is an extremely dangerous place and the public will be aware of the dangers these boys may face. 'The choice of returning home from Syria is often taken away from those that come under the control of Islamic State, leaving their families in the UK devastated and with very few options to secure their safe return.' The force said it has been supporting the missing teenagers' families and carrying out extensive inquiries alongside the North East Counter Terrorism Unit. The disappearance of the two teenagers follows the arrest of nine Britons by Turkish authorities attempting to sneak into Syria across the Turkish border. The boys are from the same town as London 7/7 suicide bomber Mohammed Siddique Khan (pictured) Waheed Ahmed, 21, from Rochdale was arrested with his aunt, cousins and four children while attempting to get into Syria. After the arrest, anti-terror police raided the home of his father, Shakil Ahmed, a respected Labour councillor for the town. Munshi's family comes from Dewsbury in West Yorkshire, where his grandfather Yakub Munshi ran the town's sharia court. The schoolboy, who was studying for his GCSEs at Westborough High School in Kirklees, West Yorkshire, was traced through his online conversations with 'cyber terrorist' Aabid Hussain Khan. In one MSN chat, they argued how best to sneak a metal sword through airport security. Munshi had painstakingly scoured the internet for details on how to make napalm and grenades. He claimed he had only done the research out of curiosity but handwritten notes hidden under his bed revealed his burning desire to travel abroad to become a martyr. Munshi also had a library of videos, documents and audio clips showing acts of jihad, mujaheddin fighters and Al Qaeda preachings. Khan, who acted as an administrator on an extremist website called Activion Publications, downloaded information on the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Charles and Camilla, Prince Edward, the Countess of Wessex, The Duke of York and the Princess Royal. Munshi was convicted of making a record of information likely to be useful in terrorism. Khan was found guilty of possessing articles for a purpose connected with terrorism but cleared of a similar charge. A third man, Sultan Muhammad from Manningham, West Yorkshire - Khan's cousin - was convicted of three similar charges and one of making a record of information likely to be useful in terrorism.","Families of Hassan Munshi and Talha Asmal, both 17, released statement .

"Jenson Button believes McLaren now have their rivals in their sights ahead of this weekend's Chinese Grand Prix. After starting the new Formula One season in Australia with a severe lack of pace, McLaren and new power-unit supplier Honda made significant progress a fortnight later in Malaysia. Although both Button and team-mate Fernando Alonso retired during the race at the Sepang International Circuit, the duo at least discovered the car was competitive alongside other midfield runners. Jenson Button looks on in the garage during final practice for last month's Malaysian Grand Prix . That came as a pleasant surprise to Button, who is now hoping further steps have been taken going into this weekend's race in Shanghai. 'Obviously we want to finish a race, but seeing improvement in pace was much more important,' said Button. 'Yes, we both had failures, but I'd rather that with us pushing and trying to get more power out of the car than trotting around at the back and simply getting to the end. 'To be able to race other cars, and see the Red Bulls until a long way into the race, was good. 'We would probably have been 20 seconds behind them. I know they're not quick, but that is a good step forward for us. Button returns to the McLaren garage after retiring during the race at the Sepang circuit . 'Right now we're comparing ourselves with the Force Indias, Saubers and Lotuses. 'We were quicker than Force India; the Sauber was on the same sort of pace, and the Lotus wasn't that much quicker. 'Fighting with the pack is important for me. It's what I enjoy and hopefully race by race we'll start picking them off.' Despite the positives, Button acknowledges the entire team, including Honda, 'still has a long way to go'. British driver Button in action before he retired from the Malaysian Grand Prix . Button added: 'We need and want more downforce to fight with the guys around us, and we still have a lot to do with the power unit, but our basic car is good. 'If you look at our high-speed pace, compared to the Force India and Sauber, then we are much stronger. 'So we're moving in the right direction, and I'm already surprised we are racing cars. It's great to see.' Part of the reasoning behind McLaren's improvement in Malaysia, in comparison to Australia, was the high temperatures which suited the car. McLaren driver Fernando Alonso (left) drives ahead of team-mate Button in Kuala Lumpur . Button appreciates the cooler air in Shanghai could have an effect. The 35-year-old said: 'There is a feeling the expected cooler weather will make it harder to generate tyre temperature. 'That could mean any progress we make doesn't necessarily translate to a lap-time benefit. 'But there is definitely progress being made, and it's great to be able to play a role in helping move the whole team forwards.

"'Loneliness maps' are being used to tackle the problem of elderly people being left alone by working out which areas' residents are most at risk. Health experts have warned that being socially isolated can be as harmful as smoking 15 cigarettes a day, leading to an increased risk of problems such as dementia and high blood pressure. Now campaigners say that local councils should draw up maps of the places where pensioners and others are most likely to suffer from social isolation. Map: This 'loneliness map' was drawn up by Essex County Council showing the areas where residents are most vulnerable to becoming socially isolated . Two county councils, Essex and Gloucestershire, have already implemented the maps, which allow them to target 'danger zones' of loneliness. A new report from the University of Kent and the Campaign to End Loneliness recommends the maps as a way of treating the problem across the country. In Gloucestershire, council bosses compiled the maps by studying statistics on a range of public health factors which are often linked to lonely people. They looked for areas with large numbers of over-65s, people living alone, people suffering from mental illness, households with no car and people on a low income. Danger: Being lonely can lead to health problems including dementia (picture posed by model) The council also surveyed residents to identify those who rarely speak to their neighbours, are unsatisfied with their social life and say they don't have someone to talk to. They then combined all those factors to map the districts where people are most likely to be suffering from loneliness, with the most vulnerable areas marked in red. A spokesman for the council said: 'Targeting local people who need our help the most is a priority for us in Gloucestershire and we are always looking at new ways to reach them. 'The map we've adapted from a model by Essex County Council means that we can work out how many people could be lonely and where those people need us most.' The Campaign to End Loneliness has now called on other councils to copy the maps and draw up their own versions for their local area. The campaign's director Laura Alcock-Ferguson said: 'Finding people who are experiencing loneliness can be challenging, as they are often also some of the most hidden people in our communities. 'However, it is encouraging that, across the country, there are excellent examples of councils that are employing different strategies to identify residents most at risk of loneliness. 'If local councils and services do not act now to find the people experiencing severe loneliness, we are likely to see the consequences in our hospitals and social care services.' The report identifies a number of other risk factors that might make people more likely to suffer from chronic loneliness. People from ethnic minorities, those recently bereaved or forced to care for their loved ones and childless pensioners are particularly susceptible.","Local councils are urged to draw up maps of the residents who are at risk .

"(CNN)Former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez will need to keep his lawyers even after being convicted of murder and other charges in the death of Odin Lloyd. The 25-year-old potentially faces three more trials -- one criminal and two civil actions. Next up is another murder trial in which he is accused of killing two men and wounding another person near a Boston nightclub in July 2012. Prosecutors have said Hernandez fatally shot Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado when he fired into their 2003 BMW.  Another passenger was wounded and two others were uninjured. Hernandez pleaded not guilty at his arraignment. The trial was originally slated for May 28, but Jake Wark, spokesman for the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office, said Wednesday the trial had been postponed and no new date had been set. ""We expect to select a new court date in the coming days and then set the amended trial track. The Suffolk indictments allege two counts of first-degree murder for the July 16, 2012, shooting deaths of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado in Boston's South End; three counts of armed assault with intent to murder and one count of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon for shots fired at three surviving victims; and one count of unlawful possession of a firearm,"" he said. The families of de Abreu and Furtado filed civil suits against Hernandez, and a judge froze his $5 million in assets, pending the outcome of the double-murder trial. The freeze includes the disputed $3.3 million signing bonus payment Hernandez claims he is owed by the New England Patriots. Hernandez is also being sued by a man who claims Hernandez shot him while they were in a limousine in Miami in February 2013. Alexander Bradley claims the then-New England Patriot tight end wounded him after the two got into a fight at a Miami strip club. In a lawsuit filed four months later, Bradley said Hernandez fired at him during a limo ride after leaving the club and that Hernandez intentionally ""possessed a gun which he was not legally licensed to have."" Hernandez's lawyers have argued he couldn't defend himself properly while on trial in Massachusetts. There was no criminal charge in the case. And then there is the grievance over unpaid bonus money filed by the NFL players union on behalf of Hernandez, who signed a contract in 2012 that potentially was worth more than $40 million. If the grievance is heard by the league, Hernandez will be represented by the the National Football League Players' Association. Who was Odin Lloyd?

"French giants Paris Saint-Germain have been dealt a major blow with the news that David Luiz will miss the Champions League clash with Barcelona. The former Chelsea man pulled up clutching his hamstring following a bursting run against Andre-Pier Gignac in the first-half of Sunday’s game against rivals Marseille. Current French champions PSG went on to win the game but the news of Luiz’ injury came as a major worry. David Luiz carries the ball out of defence on one of his trademark forays, but one such run led to his injury . The Brazilian defender immediately signalled to the bench that he would need to be replaced . And those worries have since been confirmed as scans revealed the Brazilian will be out of action for at least four weeks meaning he will miss both legs of the quarter-final tie with Barcelona. Laurent Blanc’s side are still fighting for the Ligue One title and could be forced to play eight matches without the 27-year-old. PSG currently sit top of the pile in France just one point ahead of Lyon in second. Luiz limped off, and could now be a doubt for the Champions league quarter-final against Barcelona .","Brazilian defender David Luiz pulled up during win against Marseille .

"The return of Game of Thrones has sparked a surge in internet piracy with fans making more than 100,000 illegal downloads per day. More than seven million episodes from seasons one to four were illegally downloaded between February and April this year as fans of the hit HBO show caught up or re-capped before its eagerly-return on Sky Atlantic on Sunday night. Figures by anti-piracy and security firm Irdeto revealed overall illegal downloading of show is up 45 per cent year-on-year, jumping from 4.9 million  for the same two-month period in 2014. Popular: Emilia Clarke as Daenerys Targaryen in the first series of the hit show. New figures reveal it is the most illegally downloaded show in the world . The top country for illegal downloads of Game of Thrones episodes was Brazil, which accounted for almost one million of them, followed by France in second, the US, Canada and the UK. The snapshot also revealed the top five TV shows illegally downloaded during the same period were period were The Walking Dead (5.7m), Breaking Bad (3.8m), Vikings (3.4m) and House of Cards (2.7m). Worldwide following: There were seven million illegal downloads of Game of Thrones, which features Natalie Dormer as Margaery Tyrel above, . Appeal: Fans of the hit HBO show have been rushing to download old episodes featuring Jack Gleeson as King Joffrey, left, and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau as Jaime Lannister, right . Lack of access for global audiences is used as a defence of pirates, as many of their favourite films and shows that debut in the US are delayed by weeks or months. So to make it easier for people to watch legally, HBO announced in March that the forthcoming season will air across 170 countries at the same time. This week the cable network also launched a new internet streaming service, HBO Now, in an attempt to curb piracy and recapture revenue, although it is only available in the US. The return of Game of Thrones, starring Nathalie Emmanuel as Missandei, above, has sparked a surge in internet piracy with fans making more than 100,000 illegal downloads per day . 'Piracy is a tidal wave that cannot be controlled, only managed,' said Irdeto in its report. 'But if people want to continue to have great TV shows like Game of Thrones, business models need to be protected.'","Fans downloaded seven million episodes between February and April .

"Michael Phelps is aiming to compete in a fifth Olympics next year in Rio, although the 18-time Olympic champion won't swim in the world championships this summer. Phelps confirmed his intention to make one last run at the Olympics on Wednesday. 'You guys heard it here first,' he told reporters at Skyline Aquatic Center, where he will be competing in his first meet since serving a six-month suspension by USA Swimming after a second drunken driving arrest last fall. 'I am looking forward to next year. I don't think it's too hard to really realize why I came back.' 18-time Olympic champion Michael Phelps is aiming to compete in a fifth Olympics next year in Rio . But Phelps said he won't be swimming at the world meet in Russia in August as part of the punishment set forth by the sport's U.S. governing body. He had already qualified in three events before being banned from the last major international meet before the Rio de Janeiro Olympics. 'I really enjoy being on those trips,' he said. 'That's why it is painful to think that I won't have the chance to compete at worlds.' There had been informal discussions about Phelps being reinstated to the US team for worlds, but it would have meant removing swimmers that were named to the team in his absence. 'By no means do I want this to be a distraction from the team,' he said. 'No way would I ever want to displace a member of that team.' Phelps in action during a practice session Mesa, Arizona on Wednesday . Phelps is back in Arizona, where he attended 45 days of inpatient alcohol rehabilitation after being arrested on DUI charges in his hometown of Baltimore last September. He offered no specifics about his treatment, which he continued in Maryland. He also enrolled in Alcoholics Anonymous. 'The last couple of months have probably been the hardest I've ever had to go through in my entire life,' he said. 'I take full responsibility for all of my actions. I've hurt a lot of people and it's been terrible.' The 29-year-old swimmer was sentenced to 18 months of probation. He said he's done more growing up in recent months than he has in his entire life. 'I have been able to come out on a better end, have a clear head,' he said. 'I don't think I've ever been like this once in my life.' Phelps' longtime coach, Bob Bowman, acknowledged his star swimmer's second arrest for drunken driving made it 'pretty hard to convince me that anything was going to lead us back to something that we'd be proud of.' Phelps called Bowman a few times from rehab, which the coach described as 'really weird' because he typically never heard from Phelps away from the pool. Bowman visited Phelps during treatment, still skeptical that the swimmer was there for any reason other than he had to be. But Bowman left thinking differently. Phelps is back in Arizona, where he attended 45 days of inpatient alcohol rehabilitation . 'I just had no doubt that he had changed in a way that was really meaningful,' Bowman said. 'He was completely different and it's been that way every day since he's been back.' Phelps pleaded guilty after his first drunken driving arrest in 2004. Five years later, a photo was published of him using a marijuana pipe at a party, which drew a three-month suspension and caused some sponsors to drop him. Phelps knows not everyone will believe he's contrite and has changed. 'If somebody doesn't believe the words that are coming out of my mouth that's their choice,' he said. 'I, of course, would like to show everybody in the world that I am in a different place and I am much better than I ever have been. I understand that's going to take a lot of time. This week will be the first week that I can start that.' Phelps will be competing in Mesa for the first time since the Pan Pacific Championships last August. The Arizona meet was where Phelps made his comeback a year ago after an extended retirement following the 2012 Olympics. Phelps adjusts North Baltimore Aquatic Center team-mate Allison Schmidt's cap during practice . He isn't sure what to expect, having only recently returned to the kind of hard training he did before the 2008 Beijing Games, where he won a record eight gold medals. Phelps is falling back on the mentality he used for much of his career. 'I would just get up and swim as hard as I could and leave it in the water,' he said. 'That's what I'm going to do here. I know I'm more prepared now than I was at this time last year.' His first event is the 100-meter butterfly on Thursday, when he'll compete against longtime rival Ryan Lochte. Phelps is surrounding himself with familiar faces this week, including his fiancee Nicole Johnson and family members. 'I'm a lot happier and in a lot better state and in a lot better physical shape than I really have been in a long time,' he said.","Michael Phelps is hoping to compete a the 2016 Olympics in Rio .

"Quarter of a century after his last number one, Paul Simon is back at the top of the charts. The 73-year-old - who rose to fame as part of Simon & Garfunkel - has forged ahead of more youthful musicians to reach number one in the UK album chart with The Ultimate Collection. His album outsold those by the likes of Ed Sheeran, James Bay and Sam Smith. Number one: Paul Simon topped the UK albums chart for the first time in 25 years. His latest release, The Ultimate Collection, beat albums from more youthful musicians such as Ed Sheeran and Sam Smith . Simon's recent tour with Sting (left) is believed to have been the catalyst in helping to propel him to the top of the charts. It is the first time he has reached the top of the album chart since The Rhythm of the Saints in 1990 . The greatest hits record includes 19 tracks from Simon’s 50-year career, including Mrs Robinson and The Only Living Boy in New York, from his days recording and performing as Simon & Garfunkel with Art Garfunkel, prior to their break up in the 1970s, and some of his solo hits such as 50 Ways to Leave Your Lover. It marks a return to popularity for the Grammy Award-winning singer, 73, as the first time he has reached the top of the album chart since The Rhythm of the Saints in 1990. Simon is currently on his On Stage Together world tour with Sting. It is thought the success of the pair’s live shows, which have been met with rave reviews, is what propelled the album to number one.

"An Indiana university was in lockdown late on Friday night after a 'likely prank call' about an armed person near the main administration building, school officials said. Police said they received a phone call from someone saying that they had stabbed their roommate at the university, was armed with a shotgun and threatening to blow up the administration building, according to WTHR. Manchester University had issued a statement advising students at its North Manchester campus, some 36 miles  west of Fort Wayne, to shelter in place.

"Out there in the desert, the mirage continues to shimmer for Amir Khan. The identity of the challenge becomes blurred in the haze. First it looks like Floyd Mayweather. Now he glimpses Manny Pacquiao. And in which oasis in the sand might he finally touch gloves with one of the two best boxers on earth? The initial lure has been Mayweather in Las Vegas, Nevada. Now the siren call is Pacquiao in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. For two years Khan has been so close to fighting Mayweather that he could smell the resin and hear the roar of the crowd. Yet each time he reaches out, the tantalising illusion fades and slips away like so many fantasies along the Vegas Strip. Now the image of Pacquiao dances before him and there is reason to believe that a tale which might have been told by Scheherazade could become reality one starlit Arabian night. After waiting and waiting for Floyd Mayweather, Amir Khan could be set to face Manny Pacquiao . A fight with Pacquiao, preparing to face Floyd Mayweather on May 2, is on the cards for Abu Dhabi . The handsome young prince of British boxing will pay a flying visit to Vegas on May 2, there to watch the PacMan and the Money Man dispute the richest fight of all time. Win or lose, Pacquiao could await Khan come winter. Sportsmail's Jeff Powell with Amir Khan . Bob Arum, the PacMan’s vintage promoter, has to hand a treasure trove of an offer for a fight in Abu Dhabi this November or December. Khan, the stand-by for Pacquiao had Mayweather refused the Fight of the Century, is Arum’s first choice for that extravaganza in the Middle East. Once Pacquiao’s sparring partner, now Khan says: ‘I want this fight. I would love to box Manny. We’ve been looking at an event in Dubai and Abu Dhabi is only a short drive away. It’s a dream of mine to fight in that part of the world.’ As a hero of the Muslim world, Khan would be a huge attraction there. He now has initials which are the Pakistan equivalent of a CBE behind his name. His father and mother have just returned from Islamabad where, on their son’s behalf, they received from President Mamnoon Hussain the PAPID - the President’ s Award for Pride In Performance. Arum is aware of that box office potential but also recognises the boxing qualities of the ‘nice young man’ from Bolton: ‘Amir has great speed. Maybe the only guy as fast as Manny. And his recent performances have been impressive. This would be an outstanding fight.’ Assuming that Khan wins his interim bout with Chris Algieri in New York next month, all that would appear to stand between him and his long-awaited mega-fight is the outside chance of a re-match between Pacquiao and Mayweather. Promoter Bob Arum (left), with Pacquiao and Roach after the 2009 win over Miguel Cotto, rates Khan highly . Floyd Jnr seems to have no great appetite for a second edition of May 2nd, even though a return bout might bank the man who nicknames himself Money another couple of hundred million dollars. Either way, Mayweather will conclude his enriching six-fight contract with the Showtime cable network in America in September. That timing rules out Khan as his opponent - yet again after two broken promises - because his strict observance of Ramadan would not end in time for him to prepare fully. But if it’s not a re-match and Mayweather finds another opponent, Pacquiao-Khan is a natural for both of them. Pacquiao prefers an early winter date for his second fight of a year and Khan says: ‘Late November or December is perfect for me.’ Furthermore, it is highly unlikely that if Mayweather beats Pacquiao he will want to risk his cherished unbeaten record for a second time against the most dangerous of all his opponents. Floyd Mayweather will end his six-fight deal with Showtime in September, which won't work for Khan . Pacquiao works out with trainer Freddie Roach at their base at Wild Card Boxing in Los Angeles . And Khan suspects that will be the upshot in Vegas: ‘I actually think that once Mayweather gets through Manny’s assault in the first few rounds it will become an easy win for him. ‘Manny has speed and power but Floyd has the defensive skill to avoid him and the brain and accuracy to keep picking him off as he comes in. ‘The longer it goes the harder it will get for Manny and if he is to win he will have to keep up the pace through every minute of every round.’ Khan has affection as well as respect for his old spar-mate, so it puts him in a curious position to realise that defeat for his pal would benefit himself. Khan believes Pacquiao will struggle more with Mayweather the longer their mega-fight goes on . So he says: ‘I’ll just watch it with a professional eye. And there is a chance that if Floyd’s legs really are slowing down that Manny will catch up with him - and he can punch.’ By way of further irony, Khan has been working lately to add to his high-speed aggression exactly the kind of patience he would need if he ever did fight Mayweather. Hidden away in a unit in a business park in Oakland, across the Bay from San Francisco, is the gym in which trainer Virgil Hunter hones the talents of Khan and his long-time protege Andre Ward, who will shortly make his own comeback from a long lay-off. Khan has to first overcome Chris Algieri (left), who was decked six time by Pacquiao, on May 29 in New York . But as his higher education continues under Hunter, he is buckling down. Partly in the knowledge, at 28, that these are his prime years and they must not be squandered. He says: ‘I’ve wasted the best part of a couple of years waiting for Floyd because I would love to be the man who beat the man considered the best pound-for-pound in the world. Now I have to make the most of every day because soon it may be too late. ‘Floyd and Manny are getting closer to retirement and if I don’t fight one of them soon it may never happen.’ That is one of the reasons why Khan puts on hold a Battle of Britain with Kell Brook, preferring to focus on selling himself in America and thereby stay at the front of the queue for a shot at Pacquiao or Mayweather. Kell Brook (left) is fighting Frankie Gavin (right) in the 02 Arena and Khan says he has to wait to face him . Does his May 29 fight with Algieri - recently floored six times by Pacquiao in Macao - help that crusade? ‘Algieri’s a better fighter than Frankie Gavin (Brook’s world title challenger next month). He’s world lightweight champion and he’s fought at a far higher level than Frankie. Kell can wait.’ Khan says: ‘Being at ringside (on May 2) will be a bit frustrating but I accept that this is the fight the whole world has been waiting to see. So no. I won’t be feeling any resentment.’ It is not much more than a half-hour’s flight from Oakland to Vegas. Amir Khan is hoping that the next time he takes to the air it will be on a magic carpet — to Arabia.","Amir Khan could be set to face Manny Pacquiao in Abu Dhabi, UAE .

Ms Scott's father says he has been contemplating the afterlife since Ms Scott's shocking death, but is confident that his beautiful, sweet daughter is in 'the best possible place' after living a life full of love and happiness. 'When you die I don't know what happens really, but you leave this body and our spirit is what goes on,' Mr Scott told The Daily Telegraph.

Mr Scott paid tribute to his daughter, remember her joyful childhood from her birth in Sydney, early childhood in Sydney's St Clair and time on the land from the age of nine, living in Canowindra. She loved her family, drama, soccer and school - eager for every opportunity to learn. It comes after local Leeton parents expressed anger over the loss of their children's 'favourite teacher' as the town continues to mourn the death of Stephanie Scott. Stephanie Scott was a 'favourite teacher' to many students at Leeton High School . A week before students are due to return to class after school holidays, mothers have have taken to a community Facebook page to talk about how the 26-year-old's murder has affected their kids. 'Well said, my daughter has lost her favourite teacher, and she will never be the same,' wrote Glenda Goolagong. Meanwhile Jodie Salerno posted: 'Stephanie was my son and 2 daughters favourite teacher at leeton high this ... has put so much pain and sadness on our comunity [sic].' Ms Salerno told The Australian her three children 'don't want to return' to school because they are so upset over Ms Scott's death. This comes as police are due to begin an autopsy on Stephanie Scott's body to determine how she was killed. Ms Scott's remains have been transported to Glebe Morgue in Sydney, and a NSW Department of Justice spokeswoman confirmed State Coroner Michael Barnes has ordered that an autopsy be carried out this week. Detectives who are leading the investigation into the death of Stephanie Scott will reportedly make inquiries with authorities in the Netherlands in an attempt to run a background check on the accused killer. School cleaner Vincent Stanford, who moved to Leeton  from Holland over a year ago with his mother and brother, was charged with Ms Scott's murder on Thursday. A week before students are due to return to class after school holidays, mothers have have taken to a community Facebook page to talk about how the 26-year-old's murder has affected their children .

NSW Police will get in contact with their counterparts in the Netherlands to determine if the accused 24-year-old murderer had any relevant history there, AAP reports. Stanford has reportedly been uncooperative with investigators. Daily Mail Australia has contacted NSW police for comment. It has also emerged that one of the last actions of Ms Scott was to send an email to the bus company hired for her wedding, confirming transportation for guests. The revelation follows after police discovered the charred remains of a woman's body around 5pm on Friday after they were directed to Cocoparra National Park north of Griffith, NSW by  Stanford's family. It's further alleged a gasoline can had been found nearby. It is understood Stanford was familiar to the area and went on regular camping trips to the national park  on many occasions with his family.

"A down-on-their-luck couple from Ohio struggling with chronic conditions that left them unable to make a living were found dead from self-inflicted carbon monoxide poisoning this week, less than two months after their desperate pleas for help went ignored. Randy and Jodi Speidel, from Bellefontaine, created online fundraisers on GiveFroward.com and GoFundMe.com in late February begging Good Samaritans for financial help. Mrs Speidel wrote that they had been living without gas all winter, had no running water and were close to having their electricity and Internet service shut off. Hopeless: Randy and Jodi Speidel, from Bellefontaine, Ohio, took their own lives this week, more than two months after they created online fundraisers begging for financial help . Heartbreaking: The middle-aged couple died from self-inflicted carbon monoxide poisoning caused by two charcoal grills they had dragged into their bedroom . Last-ditch effort: Mrs Speidel wrote on GiveForward.com in late February that they had been living without gas all winter, had no running water and cut down their food intake to one meal a day . After having paid $500 to their landlord to prevent their immediate eviction, Mrs Speidel stated that they were left with only $33 to their name. To stretch their meager funds a little farther, the impoverished, ailing couple were forced to limit their food intake to a single meal a day and did not have enough scraps to feed their two cats. ‘I have turned in every direction possible and don’t know what else to do,’ she wrote. ‘If you can help, we will be forever grateful and will even pay you back once we get back on our feet.’ The Speidles were hoping to raise $1,000, but the online campaign failed to draw any donations whatsoever. On Tuesday, the couple's landlord, Doug Elleman, arrived at their rental at 225 West High Avenue to discover a pink handwritten note warning passersby of carbon monoxide inside, reported Bellefontaine Examiner. Firefighters who were called to the scene entered the residence and discovered a pair of charcoal grills filled with smoldering coals. Jodi Speidel, 46, and her 45-year-old husband, Randy, were pronounced dead at the scene. Orpahns: The couple leave behind two daughters, Randa (pictured right as a baby with her father) and 20-year-old Kira Speidel . Columbus Dispatch reported that a note found nearby confirmed that the husband and wife had made a suicide pact. The couple had removed their beloved pet cats from the house to spare their lives. They were later found wandering outside. The couple leave behind two daughters, Randa and Kira Speidel. In a post left last month on her parents' GoFundMe.com page, which has since been removed, 20-year-old Kira called the couple 'the hardest-working people I know.' She went on to say that now that they can no longer work because of their physical ailments, 'they have nowhere to run.' Police Chief Brandon Standley said the town has resources available for people in need like the Speidels, adding that it's tragic that they thought they were all out of options. In one of her online pleas, Jodi Speidel mentioned she had applied for assistance and was told to wait. Her GiveForward.com campaign description indicates that despite her infirmities, Speidel was able to land a new job but needed some help to tie them over until her pay checks started coming in.","Jodi Speidel, 46, and her 45-year-old husband, Randy, were found dead in their Bellefontaine, Ohio, home Tuesday .

"Wladimir Klitschko has recalled his dramatic rise to the top on the eve of his world title defence against undefeated Bryant Jennings. The Ukrainian superstar will make his return to US soil for the first time in seven years when he takes on the slick Philadelphian at the iconic Madison Square Garden in New York. The 39-year-old Klitschko, though, has been reminiscing about how it all started for him when he won Olympic gold in Atlanta in 1996, instantly catapulting him into a hero in his home country over night. Reigning heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko (right) faces up to Bryant Jennings on Friday . 'I remember before I went to the Olympics and former Olympic champion in track running, [Valeriy] Borzov, he was Minister of Sports in the Ukraine said, 'Guys, you're going to the Olympics and one of you is going to win gold. That's going to change your life.' 'He was really right about it. I remember by winning the gold at the Olympics, when I came back home it completely changed my life. 'Sport definitely has power to change one's life and the world, as Nelson Mandela said. When I became champion of the world in the heavyweight division, that was 15 years ago, in 2000, and it was an amazing moment. Klitschko poses on the scale for the official weigh-in at Madison Square Garden in New York on Friday . 'I do remember clearly how it was and it was additional motivation to keep doing what I was doing. I was only 24-years-old. I mean, very, very young, but I took it seriously and I was working up to it and I believed that my work was appreciated with my success in the ring and that I became champion.' WBA, WBO, IBF and IBO champion Klitschko hasn't shown any signs of decline in recent times despite being just a year short of his 40th birthday. Still dominant and sitting high at the top of boxing's glamour division Klitschko believes age has no bearing on how long he can go on for. Klitschko will make his return to US soil for the first time in seven years at Madison Square Garden . 'I definitely think that age is just a number. Actually, it's a big advantage instead of disadvantage because with the age you're getting better. With the right lifestyle there's nothing that can go wrong,' he added. 'I'm really happy about the preparation [for this training camp] and I'm happy that I'm an athlete and I can get in the peak of my performance thanks to my experience. I'm looking forward to Saturday night. 'My sparring partners were 23, 25, 27, 29-years-old. It's amazing and interesting that considering my age, I used to be the youngest in the gym all the time, and now it seems my sparring partners are much younger than me. I see myself in them and we work very well. Former heaxyweight boxing champions Evander Holyfield (left) and Lennox Lewis were in attendance . Jennings, with a record of 19-0 with 10 knockouts, has been working on ways to nullify the well renowned Klitschko jab which he has utilised so effectively against past opponents. 'He has a great jab but I have an exceptional jab compared to his as well. He is one of the best athletes I've seen for that,' he said. 'There are definitely plenty of ways to actually get inside of a jab. Like lateral movement, head movement and relentless effort will definitely penetrate and make a change. 'I have 100 per cent confidence in everything that I do. I had a great training camp. The way that we actually prepare to manoeuvre around the jab, I feel is effective and I have 100 per cent faith in what we practiced. All I'm going to have to be is patient and be smart.'

"Bayern Munich may have been ravaged by injuries ahead of the Champions League game at Porto on Wednesday but the squad's sense of unity is stronger, Thomas Muller said on Tuesday. The Bavarians, chasing three titles this season, are without Arjen Robben, Franck Ribery, Bastian Schweinsteiger and David Alaba among others for the quarter-final, first leg in Portugal. 'For the (recent) games against Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen we had two matches where we played with a decimated squad and with few options,' Muller said. Bayern Munich striker Thomas Muller believes his team are stronger for their recent injury troubles . Muller celebrates his goal in Bayern's 3-0 Bundesliga win over Eintracht Frankfurt at the weekend . Bayern keeper Manuel Neuer whispers in Muller's ear during their press conference before the Porto game . Bayern beat Dortmund in the Bundesliga before edging past Leverkusen in the German Cup last eight on penalties and looked unaffected by the absences. They also beat Eintracht Frankfurt 3-0 on Saturday. 'In those games we came closer together as a group, as a unit, and that will obviously help us against Porto,' said Muller. 'Now it is not about the injuries but about building a strong unit on the pitch with the players who are there. We are confident and hopefully we can score a few goals.' Five-times champions Bayern will rely heavily on the scoring prowess of Muller and Robert Lewandowski in the absence of Robben and Ribery as they look to become the first team to beat Porto in the Champions League this season. Bayern coach Pep Guardiola is eyeing up a Treble of Bundesliga, DFB-Pokal and Champions League . Bayern celebrate with their supporters at the end of Saturday's 3-0 win over Eintracht Frankfurt .

Twice winners Porto won four matches and drew twice in the group stage before crushing Basel 5-1 on aggregate in the round of 16. 'I am surprised with their level and we will need two good games to reach the semi-finals,' said Bayern coach Pep Guardiola. 'They play an open game ... they have physical midfielders but with great quality. That is also their biggest asset. Their individual quality.' Guardiola added there was no point talking about the Bayern injuries, saying he would simply try his best with the players at his disposal. 'The last two weeks we talked about this a lot but we have this situation and we are here with these 14 players and we will try our best. That's what it is and I won't complain,' he explained.","Bayern are in Portugal to face Porto in Champions League quarters .

"Huddersfield coach Paul Anderson is hoping to kick-start his side's misfiring attack to match the efficiency of their defence as they look to start climbing back up the Super League ladder. The Giants have plummeted from third to ninth after losing all three games over the Easter holiday period but they go into Sunday's home game against Catalans Dragons with the best defensive record in the league. 'There's no hiding away from the fact we are a very good defensive team, we've just got to get our juices flowing offensively more than anything and we've put some things in place to try and make that happen,' said Anderson. Paul Anderson is hoping to kick-start his Hudderfield side's misfiring attack to climb up Super League . The Giants have plummeted from third to ninth after losing all three games over the Easter holiday period . 'We know what we're capable of and we know we can quite easily go on a decent run. We had a poor start and a poor week because the games have come thick and fast. 'We've had some issues with our offence all year and I've got to take responsibility for that, because that's my role at the club, it's my job to try and fix it. 'If we were getting beaten by 30 or 40 points we'd have some serious issues. We just need to make sure we find our groove with the ball as well as we have without it. 'If you look at the last three games we've lost, if we'd have got one more score in every game we'd probably have come out winners - those are the fine margins that we're dealing with at the minute.' A first win in four would enable Huddersfield to leapfrog their French visitors, who have won just one of five away games so far this year. Widnes are the only team yet to take a point from their travels but they will be aiming to capitalise on their impressive record at the Select Security Stadium against Castleford in Sunday's other league game. Anderson says there is no hiding when facing Catalans Dragons, who have the league's best defensive record . The Yorkshiremen can climb to a season-high fourth if they make it three wins in a row and Vikings coach Denis Betts is expecting a stern test from Daryl Powell's improving side. 'Castleford have a solid squad who all know their jobs,' Betts said. 'They work really hard for each other in defence and that allows them freedom to express themselves in attack. 'We've had some really tough games against them - very competitive games. I expect a tough physical encounter on Sunday.'","Huddersfield have plummeted to ninth in Super League after a horrible Easter .

'Wrote to Richie Benaud when I was 16 about bowling leggies. His detailed reply says everything about the great man,' Mr Stevenson, who  is now a director at LiveWire Sport, tweeted. Scroll down for video . A letter from Richie Benaud to an English fan, Jonathon Stevenson, almost 20 years ago emerged on Friday in the wake of the cricket legend's death . Accompanying the letter from Benaud, dated September 27, 1996, was a full sheet of notes about spin bowling for left-hand bowlers. 'Your letter was timely because it was the first from a left-hander and it reminded me that there is a difference in coaching and not just in the fact that one youngster might bowl with the right hand and another with the left,' Benaud wrote. 'The ball, although coming out of the hand in the same manner and going in the same direction towards the batsmen, in fact spins differently for the two types of bowlers.' Jonathan Stevenson, who now works at LiveWire Sport, was just 16 years old when he asked for Benaud's advice on left-handed leg spin and he shared the lengthy response on Twitter  as a tribute to the 'great man' Accompanying the letter from Benaud, dated September 27, 1996, was a full sheet of notes about spin bowling for left-hand bowlers . Benaud enjoyed a remarkable Test career as a wily leg-spin bowler and middle-order batsman which ended with his retirement in 1964. He was the first player to score 2,000 Test runs and take 200 Test wickets. 'I hope you enjoy your cricket and your bowling,' Benaud said. 'Yes, the left-arm over-the-wrist bowler who spins the ball into the right-hander from outside the off-stump is said to have bowled a Chinaman. The same bowler who spins one away from the right-hander has bowled a wrong'un.' After retiring, Benaud became a commentary icon initially with the BBC in England and later in his native Australia . The typed letter, dated September 27, 1996, was personally signed by Benaud . It included tips on different deliveries  and gave pointers as to how they should be delivered . In his letter to a young Mr Stevenson, he listed a full page of various different deliveries the teenager should try and gave pointers as to how they should be delivered. 'Don't even think about learning the 'flipper' before you have mastered the leg-break, topspinner and wrong'un,' he finished with. The typed letter was  signed by Benaud. After retiring, Benaud became a commentary icon initially with the BBC in England and later in his native Australia.

"An Ohio woman discovered that her biological mother worked at the same company as her and lived only six minutes away. The Ohio Department of Heath released birth records for people born between January 1, 1964, and September 18, 1996, last month, allowing people their first access to the information. After receiving her records in the mail, La-Sonya Mitchell-Clark, 38, of Youngstown, finally got the answers she's wanted almost her whole life. She looked up her mother's name, Francine Simmons, on Facebook and found out she worked Infocision - the same call-center operation company she works at. La-Sonya Mitchell-Clark (left) of Youngstown, Ohio, found out her birth mother was Francine Simmons (right) after the Ohio Department of Heath released birth records for people born between January 1, 1964, and September 18, 1996, last month . 'Ever since I found out that I was adopted I wanted to know who my biological mother was,' Mitchell-Clark told WYTV. And after connecting the dots, she realized her mother was closer than she could imagine. 'There's a Francine that works at my job,' she said after finding the woman on Facebook. 'She works in VR and she works at the front desk.' She reached out to friends on social media who knew Simmons and the next day she got a phone call from her birth mother. 'She called me and I said, ""Is this Ms. Francine?"" She said, yes. I said, ""I think I'm your daughter"",' Mitchell-Clark said about the first time the women spoke. And, as it turns out, the mother and daughter live just six minutes away from one another in Youngstown. Simmons said she was 'still in shock' from finding out about her daughter, who she always wanted to contact but never knew how. Mitchell-Clark (left) reached out through social media to speak with Simmons (right) and they eventually decided to meet after a phone call. They found out they work at the came call-center operations company and live six minutes away from one another . Mitchell-Clark also found out that she had three biological younger sisters. Two of the sisters, Kamala (left) and Maisha (right) Cummings, said that the reunion was 'a relief' and 'amazing' for their family . 'I got pregnant when I was 14. I had her when I was 15. I was put in a home, a girl's home. Had her. Got to hold her. Didn't get to name her, but I named her myself in my heart all these years,' Simmons told WYTV. Mitchell-Clark also found out that she has three younger sisters she didn't know about. Simmons's daughter Kamala Cummings said that meeting Mitchell-Clark has been 'a sense of relief' for  her family, particularly for her mother. 'It's just amazing that all this time we're thinking about her and trying to find her and she was trying to find us, too,'  Maisha Cummings, another daughter of Simmons, told WYTV. Mitchell-Clark said that her adoptive parents have been very supportive of her search for her biological parents. '(They've) always encouraged me to look for them.

"Residents of a tiny Missouri city say they have no idea why five of their six police officers and several other top officials resigned after their first black mayor was elected. Tyrus Byrd, 40, was sworn into office in Parma last week, but her election victory was overshadowed by the departure of the majority of the police force, the city attorney, clerk and water treatment supervisor. The officials all cited 'safety concerns' in their resignation letters, the outgoing mayor says. There are 713 people living in the community and, according to the US Census Bureau, 57percent are white and 41percent are black. Unwelcome change: Tyrus Byrd, who was sworn in as mayor last week, must find replacements for five of the city's six police officers, the city attorney, the city clerk and the water treatment supervisor. Mrs Byrd, who was sworn in last Wednesday, told Daily Mail Online she still doesn't know why the employees quit - though the outgoing mayor says they cited 'safety concerns' in their resignations . Mrs Byrd, who was sworn in on Wednesday, told the Daily Mail Online on Sunday that she is still not sure why the city employees quit. Her father, former city board member Simon Wofford, insists his daughter has a good relationship with the police department. KFVS-TV broke the story last week. Citizens rallied to Mrs Bryd's side, saying that the town didn't even need as many officers as it had. 'I think it was pretty dirty the way they all quit without giving her a chance, but I don't think they hurt the town with quitting because who needs six police for 740 people?' resident Martha Miller told KFVS. The run-down city, which is 175 miles south of St. Louis in southeastern Missouri, has suffered a spate of break-ins recently. Despite the surge in crime and the comparatively large police force, residents told the TV station that they almost never saw cops patrolling the streets. Mrs Byrd told Daily Mail Online that the election of the first African American mayor should be celebrated instead of focusing on the departures of city employees. Randall Ramsey, the outgoing mayor who has spent 36 years in the job, told the Daily Mail Online he also has no idea why the group quit.

"From the best night's kip being enjoyed on a Wednesday to rising the earliest on a Sunday, new data is giving fascinating insights into how the world sleeps. Using statistics from Sleep Cycle app users, researchers have discovered that the earliest wake-up time worldwide is on a Monday in South Africa. While on Tuesdays, Americans rise at 7am and are in the worst mood all week. In terms of national average sleep quality, Slovakia topped the list.  The UK was in 45th place, while the US was in 49th. The best sleep quality worldwide occurs on a Wednesday night. More than half (58 per cent) of countries surveyed said they had the most restful sleep on this day . Other countries that wake-up grumpy on Tuesdays include Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, South Africa and Brazil. The Sleep Cycle app tracks a user's sleep as they go through a cycle of sleep phases. It uses the phone's accelerometer to identify phases by tracking movements in bed and wakes users up during their lightest sleep phase, using a pre-defined 30-minute alarm window. It has more than two million active users and gathered data for the study between 1 June 2014 and 31 March this year from users aged 18 to 55 in 47 countries. Other insights from this data include that the best sleep quality worldwide occurs on a Wednesday night. Over the course of the week, people in Finland get the most hours sleep - on a Saturday with eight hours and two minutes, on average. On the same night, people in Japan get an average of just six hours and nine minutes sleep. This graph shows which days of the week countries sleep the most . More than half (58 per cent) of the countries surveyed said they had the most restful sleep on this day, with China recording the highest sleep quality in the world that night. On Thursdays, people in the Middle East wake the latest and the happiest, and in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and UAE in particular, users also reported the best mood on Thursdays. Despite waking up grumpy on Tuesdays, by Friday the US sleeps in the most and wakes up happiest. The data revealed Americans typically don't rise until 8:24am on Fridays and also report the best wake-up mood. MONDAY: The world wakes up earliest on Mondays with South Africa rising first at 6:09 am . TUESDAY: Americans rise early at 7am and are consequently in the worst mood all week. Other countries that also wake-up grumpy on Tuesdays include Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, South Africa and Brazil . WEDNESDAY: 58% of countries surveyed - including the US - experience sleep best on Wednesdays, with China recording the highest sleep quality in the world that night. THURSDAY: Middle East users sleep longer on Thursdays than any other day, and Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and UAE also report the best mood on Thursdays. FRIDAY: Americans sleep latest on Fridays, not rising until 8:24am. They also report the best wake-up mood. People in Costa Rica, Canada, New Zealand and Sweden also wake up the happiest on Friday. However, the majority of the world (71 per cent), wake up in the best mood on Saturdays. SATURDAY: Nearly 90% of countries surveyed sleep more and wake up later on Saturday compared to any other day of the week. SUNDAY:The majority of the world (66% of countries) spends the least amount of time in bed on Sundays. Topping the list is South Korea where users only sleep 5 hours and 53 minutes on Sunday nights.

"Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton haven't always seen eye-to-eye in the past 12 months but the pair appeared to be singing from the same hymn sheet on Thursday. Fresh from being beaten by Ferrari driver Sebastian Vettel at the Malaysian Grand Prix on March 29, the Mercedes team-mates have been collaborating with their team to ensure the prancing horse doesn't gallop to victory at the next race in China. The duo attended Mercedes' Brackley base in the hope to find a winning formula come race weekend in Shanghai on April 10-12.

Speaking after the race in Malaysia, Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff conceded that he was a worried man following the manner of Vettel's victory. Suggestions of another season of Mercedes domination in the wake of a comfortable one-two in the season-opening race in Australia were blown apart by Ferrari and Vettel. The four-time world champion beat Hamilton by 8.5 seconds, with team-mate Nico Rosberg a further four seconds adrift in third. Mercedes boss Toto Wolff (right) was surprised by Sebastian Vettel's Malaysian Grand Prix victory . Wolff admitted that the German driver deserved to win and Ferrari got their tactics spot-on in the soaring heat . Despite searing heat of more than 30 degrees, Vettel's Ferrari was kinder on its tyres, stopping just twice compared to three for both Hamilton and Rosberg. And afterwards Wolff admitted: 'We were pretty sure the three-stop strategy would work for us. 'We probably went a bit too aggressive on set-up, which pushed us into a direction of a three-stop. 'But in the circumstances, with the high temperatures, they were able to go at a faster pace over long runs than us. 'We need to analyse why that was the case, and it clearly shows it's not going to be an easy one. 'It is clear they won the race, which is worrying. It wouldn't be right to say we lost it.'

"Hong Kong (CNN)There's a booming black market in Hong Kong, but it's not for fake Apple Watches, or the iPhone. Instead, people are going crazy for tins of butter cookies. Tourists and locals line up around the block for several hours just to get their hands on Jenny's cookies -- at $9 a tin. Its popularity has spurred bakeries to make and sell knockoffs, and the original store has signs warning against buying 'fake' Jenny's cookies. The tiny shop, located in Tsim Sha Tsui, one of the city's main shopping districts, is swarming with people handing over wads of cash for the ""little bear cookies"" as they are known across Asia. People are even hired to stand in line to buy the goods and are later resold at a 70% mark-up yards away, something the bakery also tries to discourage. A few meters away from the long cookie line, old ladies hold up paper signs advertising the cookies for sale. But when they see cameras approaching, they scurry away, only to reappear on another street corner. The frenzy in Hong Kong over the buttery treats is by no means an isolated example.

"(CNN)This week, Hillary Clinton surprised the world yet again — not with the official launch of her campaign but for the unconventional way she did it. She sure pushed the envelope. With her video, new logo and road trip, she opened a long communications campaign not only to ""rebrand"" herself but to completely reframe who she is, what she stands for and how she intends to run. We'll find out over the next year and a half whether it will work. Many in the press and on late-night television scratched their heads this week; others were scathing. Ruth Marcus --  a  columnist for the Washington Post -- dismissed her launch video as a ""relentlessly, insultingly vapid"" effort of ""demographic box-checking."" Jon Stewart lampooned it as a ""State Farm commercial gone viral"" and also ""boring as s---."" Since the media will likely be the stand-in primary opponent for Hillary, their belief in her authenticity is a critical factor in whether she can reframe herself in voter's eyes. But from a marketing perspective, her launch may have been much more successful than critics think. The YouTube announcement video took on the central strategic challenge for the campaign and candidate: To flip Clinton's message from self-absorbed ""I"" to empathetic ""we."" While critics may sneer, it is hard to deny that the image it projects of Hillary is more confident, fresher, simpler and forward-looking, with even a bit of the upstart feel of two of the most successful product launch companies, Nike and Apple. Clinton's team may have begun to create an empathetic relationship with voters that has eluded her in the past, most crucially when she lost the nomination fight to Barack Obama in 2008. In marketing terms, rebranding is a strategy to bring a new name, term, symbol or design to an established brand with the aim of developing a new identity in the minds of consumers. Reframing is a strategy that goes further: it seeks to change how a consumer (or voter) emotionally experiences an established brand. A rebrand may change how you think about a brand; a reframe may change how you feel about it.  In the Apple case, the company at one time fell on its face when it unveiled the original Macintosh; some thought the company was headed for oblivion. But when Steve Jobs returned as CEO, he went back to the drawing board and soon unveiled the iPod, which not only changed the way consumers thought about Apple, but how they experienced it. Not only a rebrand -- but a reframe. Take Hillary's road trip to Iowa in the van nicknamed Scooby. The press lampooned her, but I would bet that for many others, her unscripted and anonymous stop at Chipotle reinforced the ""everyday Americans"" campaign theme. Hillary stood in line to order, an everyday customer among everyday people at an everyday fast-food chain. Also introduced last week was what will come to be the single most-ubiquitous element of her campaign: Clinton's new and controversial  campaign logo. It is a brilliant, iconic expression of the emotional connection she wants people to have with her, her message and her movement.  In fact, her logo is all about movement. Simple, confident, high tech and shorthand to a much younger set of voters, the bold red arrow moving left to right in front of the strong blue H says it all: You are the important ones. I'm here to support you with everything I've got. Let me help you move forward. Taken together, all the pieces of Clinton's announcement -- as well as the unconventional media she used to deliver them -- bring her back on stage not as a leader from yesterday but, surprisingly, as one for the future. Coincidentally, the way Marco Rubio announced his run for the Republican nomination most likely amplified the impact of Clinton's reframing. For all his posturing about being the new generation, Rubio followed to a ""T"" the most traditional script for announcing a candidacy: traditional stage and podium, dark suit, bright tie, wife and kids on camera, a live speech, all about himself, timed for the evening news. Rubio's logo, the signature of his image, drew immediate criticism for being amateurish and unconsidered, even leaving Alaska and Hawaii off the map of America. In stark contrast, Hillary showed the confidence and finesse to buck tradition on every front. It was Hillary who pulled the ultimate jiu-jitsu. There are those, of course, who will be alienated, if not disgusted, by the way her campaign has unfurled such a sophisticated marketing plan. In a day when voters are yearning for authenticity, how do we know this is the real Hillary or a candidate in a mask?  Fair question. But for better or worse, mass marketing has become the staple of presidential campaigns -- that's where most campaign dollars go. Both sides know how to play, sometimes brilliantly.  Remember the Reagan advertisements of 1984, proclaiming ""Morning in America""? What we know is that over time, voters see a lot of unscripted moments of a candidate where the real character comes through. And if they spot hypocrisy between ads and the candidate, that campaign will get into trouble fast. That's why the key to Hillary Clinton's success in reframing her message and movement will be consistency.  She must not only take the essence of a humble, empathic relationship with voters and integrate it into all elements of her communication, she must also live it every day. Otherwise there will be messaging ""schizophrenia,"" the solid start with flashes of brilliance will peter out and she'll be facing the same voter perceptions that doomed her race in 2008. In the meantime, one can imagine Clinton getting a huge, satisfying belly laugh out of the early returns on her efforts.","Martha Pease: Hillary Clinton got her presidential bid launched by reframing who she is, what she's about .

'I started commuting to London in August 2012 and the business trip to Hong Kong was in December that year,' she said. 'I had been travelling out there for ten years but luckily I had always managed to upgrade or have no one in the seat next to me. 'But this trip coming back I was in economy and it is the one that really sticks out in my memory. 'I remember being rammed in my seat with a lady next to me. I felt uncomfortable not just for me but for her too. Sharon says her weight was down to to commuting to London for her job as a clothes designer but after quitting her job to go freelance and work from home, Sharon was able to exercise at lunch . 'I ended up standing for the entire flight with my iPod in. 'I was genuinely worried I might hurt the woman in the next seat because of my weight. She didn't say anything but I just didn't think it fair for her to suffer because of my size. 'The flight attendant even offered me the seats they use for take-off and landing. But with the big long-haul jets there is more room to stand.' But even back in the UK, she was fed-up of the daily humiliation of her long journeys to work. She said; 'On top of this, every time I went to London I was fed up having to squeeze into train seats.' Sharon made small changes to her lifestyle, such as walking around London rather than taking the Tube, and in January 2014, she decided to quit her high-flying job and go freelance. She began working from her home which meant she could go for a walk every lunchtime. Sharon took up running last March and by now was around 13st to 14st and finding it difficult to lose any more weight. Friends were talking about the 'Couch to 5k' beginners running programme so she started doing that and signed up for a 5k Race for Life, which she did last July in an impressive 40 minutes. After getting a taste for activity Sharon joined a runners' website, The Running Bug, which 'changed her life' as she was egged on by other enthusiasts. Sharon added: 'The site, especially the members' forum, gave me so many tips and so much encouragement.' Sharon took part in a 5k Race for Life which she completed in just 40 minutes . The designer has since completed two 10k runs last year and even ran the Brighton half marathon in two hours and 59 seconds in February this year. Sharon, who is also running the Morrisons Great Birmingham 10k run this Sunday, added: 'The weight loss really picked up when I started running, it really helped with the momentum. 'Once I started training for my first 10k race last summer, the pounds really dropped off. 'I think it was a mix of things that caused the problems, I knew my diet wasn't healthy. 'At the weekends I tended to graze the whole day through so there wouldn't be that many minutes when I wasn't eating, it was constantly chocolate and crisps. 'Now I don't buy any processed foods, I don't even buy ready-made bread and I try to make everything from scratch. 'I eat a lot more fruit and veg and try to eat health fats like nuts.'","Children's clothes designer Sharon Smith, 43, weighed over 20st .

"Barcelona's 1-0 La Liga victory against Celta Vigo on Sunday evening featured one of the most bizarre incidents of the season so far. With the score at 1-0 following Jeremy Mathieu's 73rd minute header, tempers flared between Celta striker Fabian Orellana and Sergio Busquets as the Barcelona midfielder attempted to waste time during the closing stages. Orellana remonstrated angrily with the match officials before grabbing a lump of grass from the floor and throwing it in the direction of Busquets.

"Armenia is a country in Eurasia's South Caucasus region famous for its mountainous landscapes and rich history ... but mainly, right now at least, for the fact Kim Kardashian and her posse are there. Kim Kardashian, her husband Kanye West, their daughter North and Kim's sister Khloe arrived in the capital Yerevan on Wednesday to a rock star welcome and over eight days are checking out a plethora of local landmarks. The visit is their first to the country their late father, Robert Kardashian, fled for America and both Kim and Khloe have expressed their excitement at the chance to explore his homeland. Kim Kardashian is in Armenia with her husband Kanye West and their daughter North on an eight-day visit to the country of her dad's birth . The celebrity visitors are in the capital Yerevan, a culturally rich city where the Opera House (centre) is among its most notable landmarks . The Yerevan Opera House is a must-visit place in the Armenian capital where local music and dance performances are highly regarded . Kim, Kanye and Khloe Kardashian are staying at the Armenia Marriott Hotel Yerevan which is on Republic Square, formerly Lenin Square . Republic Square is a tourist attraction in itself, with its combination of Soviet-era architecture and Neo-Classical official buildings . And from what Lonely Planet says of the city, it's made for the icons of modern-day entertainment. 'While it's the undeniable cultural, economic and political heart of the nation, Yerevan can at times feel like a city on permanent holiday,' Lonely Planet's introduction to its guide of the city. 'All summer long, Yerevanites saunter up and down the main boulevards, preening in high fashion and fast cars while occasionally popping into a parkside cafe to schmooze over a drink or two.' Sounds familiar... While there, the Kardashian-West crew are staying in the capital's finest digs, the Armenia Marriott Hotel Yerevan, which frames Republic Square at the heart of the city, and have the burliest of bodyguards and police in tow as they take in the sights. But what would we, the mere mortals not of reality TV fame, see and do if we followed in their footsteps? Yerevan's Zvartnots International Airport is well connected to major centres throughout Europe although cheaper flights (upwards of £300 during summer and less in colder months) from London require a transfer somewhere like Moscow, Kiev or Vienna. Without the need to book out the two executive floors of the hotel for our entourage and filming crew, as the Kardashian crew have, a standard room from 67,150 Armenian Drams is good value (sounds like a lot but works out at about £96). A smartphone view of the Katoghiken church in the World Heritage-listed Geghard Monastery, where Kim, Kanye and North visited . The monastery is a medieval set of structures which have in part been carved out of the mountain and date back to the fourth century . Documenting every moment: Camera crews followed the family as they took a tour of historical sites . Outside the Monastery of Geghard women sell the same traditional sweet bread that was offered to Kim on their arrival in Armenia . The hotel is well chosen by their people as it's right in the middle of this relatively easy to get around city, where the majority of main sights are free. The square is a tourist attraction in itself, with its combination of Soviet-era architecture and Neo-Classical buildings such as the Houses of Government and the Marriott itself, but with their own Armenian twists. In the heart of the cultural and business hub of Yerevan, the square is connected to the other main area of the city that has the impressive Opera House at its centre. While Kanye's hip-hop may not be the preferred genre of the nation - fans appear to be more interested in the stars of Keeping Up with the Kardashians - the city isn't short on culture with a disproportionately large amount of theatres, galleries and clubs for its size, with plenty of live music to be found. Their minders say the timing has nothing to do with it, but the Kardashians' arrival comes as the nation counts down to the 100th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide on April 24 which honours up 1.5 million people were killed by the Ottomans between 1915 and 1917. Turkey dispute the figures - they claim 300,000 to 500,000 Armenians died during a civil uprising against the Ottomans - but Armenians have fought for international recognition of the tragedy for decades. But the memory of those whose lives were taken are very much honoured in this city and throughout the country. The Cascades is the main part of the Cafesjian Museum, found in the centre of Yerevan, which features an array of  modern  Armenian art . Khachkars, an Armenian cross stone, are common features of medieval Christian art found in the Cascades . The Sculture Park features works from Botero and other internationally-recognised artists and a stellar view of the city . This statue at the Cascades represents Russian-born architect Alexander Tamanian, whose greatest work was planning modern Yerevan . Among the major sights on the Kardashian's itinerary is Yerevan's extensive Armenian Genocide Museum-Institute http://www.genocide-museum.am/eng/index.php along with the National Archives where they hope to see documents relating to their ancestors. The party has already visited Yerevan's Mother Armenia statue, a large representation of a women holding a big sword that is said to be the female personification of the country and proved quite an inspiration for the sisters. A visit to their father's home city of Gyumri would find a smaller version of the statue minus the collection of decommissioned tanks, rocket launchers and other military items. 'The Mother Armenia statue symbolizes peace through strength,' Khloe wrote on Instagram. 'It can remind viewers of some of the prominent female figures in Armenian history. Who took up arms to help their husbands in their clashes with Turkish troops and Kurdish irregulars. I am woman hear me roar! Blessed to be here!' Victory Park, home to the statue, also offers a brilliant view of the city . Kim echoed the sentiment: 'This statue reminds visitors of the strong female figures in Armenian history. I love how powerful women are and respected so much in our culture!' The huge Mother Armenia statue (said to be the female personification of the nation) and military museum at Victory Park in Yerevan . While there said to be more Armenians living abroad than in the country itself, due to millions who fled the alleged genocide, local culture has been diligently preserved. Their welcome to a packed airport included a traditional gift of bread and salt from women in traditional Armenian dress. Similar breads are found sold by locals at the Unesco World Heritage-listed Monastery of Geghard, a medieval set of structures which have in part been carved out of the mountain where where Kim and Kanye have taken North. The main chapel was built in 1215 but the complex originated in the fourth century and has a rich and varied history. Other sights include the 3,000-year-old Erebuni Fortress that was the beginning of Yerevan and the more modern Cascades, Sculpture Park and Cafesjian Museum, their modern art centre. Or romantics could visit Lover's Park, a Japanese-style garden which hosts open-air concerts and art exhibitions. While a minority are unimpressed with the celebrities' arrival most are delighted to see them, including the government. The group has met with the nation's prime minister Hovik Abrahamyan, who praised their contribution to 'international recognition and condemnation of the Armenian genocide.' Parliament speaker Galust Saakian said their visit can only be a good thing. 'Kim Kardashian is a lady who's known worldwide. We should be happy she came here,' he said. The Kardashian family tree has rich historical roots in Armenia . Robert Kardashian, father of Kim, Kourtney, Khloe and Robert Jr, was a third-generation Armenian American. The celebrity lawyer, who passed away in 2003 just eight weeks after being diagnosed with oesophageal cancer, passed on his pride in his heritage to his family, who have been vocal about their Armenian roots. Robert's ancestors fled the Armenian Genocide in the early 20th century, thanks to a 'prophet' who urged them to uproot to America. Known at the time as the Kardaschoffs, in Russian style, the family made their way from their home village of Karakale in the late 19th Century to German ports. From there, they travelled to a new life in America on the passenger vessels SS Brandenberg and SS Koln. By doing so, they escaped the triple horror of the First World War from 1914-18, the 'Armenian Genocide' starting in 1915 - exactly a century ago this year - and the Russian Revolution in 1917. Among those fleeing Erzurum - then in Armenia, and ruled by last Russian Tsar Nicholas II - was family patriarch Hovhannes Miroyan and Kim's great great grandfather, born in 1844. He married  Luciag Chorbajian, born in 1853. The couple wed in Erzurum, which is now in Turkey, in 1867 but escaped along with their daughter Vartanoosh Mironyan, born in 1886, in the early 20th century. Vartanoosh's distinctly blonde daughter Haigoohi Arakelian, known as Helen, was born in America in 1917, the year the Bolshevik Revolution rocked the Russian Empire. She was Kim's grandmother, who later married into the Kardashian clan. The glamorous and 'dynamic' Helen wed Arthur who ran the largest meat-packing business in southern California. Helen's son Robert married Kris Houghton and fathered the 21st Century's biggest reality TV stars Kourtney, Khloe, Robert Jr and Kim. Their mother Kris eventually married Olympic gold medalist Bruce Jenner and together they raised two more TV personalities, Kendall and Kylie.","Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, along with their daughter North and sister Khloe, are visiting Armenia .

"A couple who married in their teens and suffer from cystic fibrosis are in a race against time as the young wife waits for a life-saving lung transplant. Katie Prager, 24, was diagnosed with an infection in her lungs in September 2009 and is desperately in need of a transplant as doctors predicted she would not live a year without new lungs. As her health continues to decline, her husband Dalton, 23, who has already received new lungs, is pleading for help. Her insurance company, Kentucky Medicaid, will not pay for the out-of-state treatment she needs at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, he says. Dalton pleaded: 'They are turning my wife into a number, a statistic, a dollar sign. I cannot lose her. This can’t be the end of our love story. 'We are both ready to continue fighting but at this point we are running out of options and need your help. Please help me save my wife Katie.' Scroll down for video . Katie and Dalton Prager (above), who suffer from cystic fibrosis, followed their hearts and married as teens in 2011 . Katie, left, was diagnosed with an infection in her lungs called Burkholderia Cepacia, and is desperately in need of a transplant as doctors predicted she would not live a year without new lungs . Dalton has already received new lungs, but Katie is waiting as Kentucky Medicaid will not pay for the out-of-state-treatment she needs at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center . For the couple who put everything on the line when they first met in person in 2009, her husband can not imagine losing the love of his life who he married four years ago. In December 2014, Katie was discharged from the Pittsburgh hospital after a long stay and returned to Kentucky, but began having trouble breathing three days later. The hospital would not admit her because Medicare would not pay because she had used her lifetime maximum, the couple says. She will not be covered for the expensive out-of-state medical procedure again until she spends 60 consecutive days out of the hospital. She was admitted into University of Kentucky Hospital, but it however, does not do transplants on patients with the kind of infection that Katie has. 'Sixty days out of the hospital is not an option for her anymore. Medicaid is also not an option as it will not cover her transplant due to UPMC being 'out of network',' Dalton wrote on the couple's YouCaring page. 'After explaining to Medicaid and Pittsburgh that there are only two places in the country, who would operate, due to (the bacteria) Cepacia, (UPMC and Duke Medical Center) still refused to work together to help her. 'She is struggling to attempt to negotiate her healthcare options from her hospital bed at the University of Kentucky.' Dalton said: 'They are turning my wife into a number, a statistic, a dollar sign. I cannot lose her. This can’t be the end of our love story' Only three months away from their four-year anniversary, the couple has not been together since November 2014 when Dalton received new lungs, and hope they can be together to celebrate . Katie said that she feels like efforts to get transferred to Pittsburgh are at a standstill and that something needs to be done. 'It needs to happen soon. Nervous they aren't going to accept my case and that I'll have to restart this whole process at a completely different hospital,' she wrote on the couple's Facebook page. In February, Dr. Michael Anstead who is Katie's pulmonologist at the University of Kentucky, wrote a letter to Medicaid seeking for them to make an exception and pay for Katie's care in Pittsburgh, according to CNN. But Kentucky Medicaid denied the proposal saying UPMC declined to enroll as a Kentucky Medicaid provider. 'Medicaid policies allow for a simplified enrollment process for out-of-state providers in such situations,' Gwenda Bond, spokeswoman for the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services wrote in a statement to CNN. 'Should UPMC reverse its decision and choose to enroll as a Kentucky Medicaid provider, the Department for Medicaid Services...will be happy to expedite their application.' However, the hospital claims that Medicaid told them if they wanted to treat Katie, they would be required to sign up hundreds of doctors to accept Kentucky Medicaid patients. 'UPMC wants to help Katie, and our physicians and staff have done everything possible to make that happen...It is up to Kentucky Medicaid to address this situation,' wrote spokeswoman Wendy Zellner. So far, the couple relies on communication on phones and computers to keep in touch . UPMC said they are want to help Katie but said it is up to Kentucky Medicaid to address the situation . While Katie seems to be caught in limbo, the director of the media relations group at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said they are working to find a solution concerning her case by reaching out to the state agency. Only three months away from their four year anniversary in July, the couple have not been together since November 2014 when Dalton received his lung transplant at UPMC. Even though he also had Cepacia like Katie, which makes lung transplants more complicated, his has been a success. However, he has not been able to be near his wife in person until she receives a lung transplant because of the risk of infection. So far, they rely on communication through their phones or computers. But all they want is to be able to spend their anniversary together. 'I just want to make it to see our four year anniversary in July and be able to hold hands and just hug,' Katie told CNN. 'That's all I really want -- to be able to hug my husband on our fourth anniversary.' So far, the couple's YouCaring page has raised $43,425 in donations out of its goal of $50,000.","Katie and Dalton Prager, 24 and 23, met in 2009 and married two years later .

"Soft-poached quail egg, confit of tomato and deep fried polenta all prepared by a Michelin-starred chef - you could be forgiven for thinking this is just a meal at another trendy gastro restaurant. But it is in fact one of the dishes on offer at the staff canteen at yoghurt maker Yeo Valley's headquarters, which overlooks the Blagdon countryside in North Somerset.

A typical day for me isn’t just about food – it might involve interviewing staff and discussing ideas with Sarah Mead, as well as creating new recipes. 'I hate being pigeon-holed into a specific 9 to 5, Monday to Friday job. Instead, I finish when I’m happy. I always have a list of jobs I need to achieve, and I like to push and challenge myself because you never know what tomorrow morning bring. He added: 'I enjoy talking to local people about being self-sufficient and eating seasonally. 'Some people say that cooking seasonally becomes boring in the winter, because at that time all you have are brassicas, parsnips and swedes.

"Child sexual abuse reports have soared since Operation Yewtree which was sparked by Jimmy Savile's assaulting of dozens of children . Reports of child sex abuse cases have risen by more than 60 per cent in the wake of investigations such as Operation Yewtree and the Rotherham scandal. Figures revealed thousands more people had contacted police with allegations of abuse since 2011, with nearly 9,000 reports filed in 2014. Despite a surge in reports, the number of arrests fell by nine per cent, prompting critics to accuse the Government of failing victims of abuse. Among the forces to see the largest rise in reported cases was South Yorkshire where there was a 577 per cent increase over the last five years. It comes after an estimated 1,400 children were abused in the area over several years, with officials in Rotherham ousted as a result of the scandal having been deemed not fit for purpose. While only 74 cases of child sex abuse were reported to the force in 2011, 501 were investigated in 2014, the figures, obtained via Freedom of Information request by The Guardian, revealed. But while a surge in the number of reports suggested victims felt more comfortable coming forward, a decrease in the number of arrests made prompted critics to accuse police of not doing enough. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper described the ratio of reported crimes to arrests as a 'national scandal'. 'This isn't a problem from the past. It is a growing problem the Government should be confronting right now. 'Victims of child sex abuse are being let down when alongside a 60 per cent increase in reports there has been a nine per cent drop in arrests for child sex abuse, as well as falling prosecutions and convictions for child abuse offences as the police are unable to keep up.' Shaun Wright, the former Police and Crime Commissioner of South Yorkshire Police, resigned over the force's handling of the Rotherham child abuse scandal . Thames Valley Police made 191 arrests in relation to child sex abuse - up from just 13 in 2011. Campaigners said the rise was indicative of increased awareness of child sexual abuse among the public. 'In recent years there has been a huge increase in awareness of child sexual abuse and it’s good that more people are coming forward,' Alan Wardle, NSPCC head of policy and public affairs, said. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the figures were a 'national scandal' 'Since the Operation Yewtree police investigation was launched in 2012, the NSPCC helpline has seen a huge rise in the number of victims willing to speak out, get support and help bring abusers to justice. 'In the year after Yewtree was launched there was an 81% increase in calls about sexual abuse to the NSPCC helpline and this surge continues. 'When children take the extremely difficult step of reporting abuse we need to ensure they are properly supported and get the help they need when they are brave enough to give evidence in court.' Operation Yewtree was sparked by revelations made in 2012 that the late comedian Jimmy Savile had sexually abused children and young women in the 1970s and 80s. The Scotland Yard investigation is understood to pursue three lines of inquiry. The first relates to Savile's crimes while the second to allegations made against him and other public figures. The third was set up to investigate reports made as a result of the high-profile Savile allegations.","Police have seen a surge in number of  child sex abuse cases since 2011 .

Audrey Pekin, 19, says she was attacked by a man, Henry Alafu, who she had met with other friends a few days earlier when he lured her to his remote home - and then assaulted her again in a taxi as she tried to flee. According to Channel 9's A Current Affair, the pair began drinking together at the Bounty Bar in Kuta, before moving to the nearby Sky Garden to continue the night. Scroll down for video . Audrey Pekin has detailed the alleged rape and attack she suffered while on a Christmas holiday to Bali with her family . Alafu lured Ms Pekin back to where his property away from the bustling tourist centre of the city, and brutally raped her on two separate occasions. Alafu told Ms Pekin a party was taking place a nearby villa, and the pair agreed to go to it together. According to ACA, during in taxi ride to the home, Ms Pekin began to feel unwell due to her type 1 diabetes. Once they arrived at the house, she was not put off by the lack of noticeable noise that suggested there was no party taking place, because her illness made it 'impossible to think', she told the show. Inside the house, Alafu locked the door and forced Ms Pekin to the bed where he allegedly attacked her. 'He went from a man to a monster,' Ms Pekin said. 'I can't quite describe the feeling, the sadness, to know what was about to happen and that I would or could not have done anything to stop it. 'I was literally shaking and drooling... I threw some very feeble punches, but I could not move my arms...I could not move anything.' After the first alleged attack, Ms Pekin said she desperately tried to escape. Alafu then followed her, and tormented her as she struggled to flee. She sought help from passing motorists and workers in a nearby service station, but Alafu allegedly told staff to ignore her and 'to stay out of it', the show reported. Ms Pekin believed she was safe when a cab picked her up, only for Alafu to force his way into the cab and again allegedly rape her. Henry Alafu is the man the Pekin family believed attacked their daughter . CCTV footage captured Alafu waiting in the lobby for Ms Pekin, as she stopped at the hotel before they continued with their night out. It was before the alleged attack took place . 'He kept trying to kiss me... he molested me in the back of the taxi for everyone, for the taxi driver, to see,' she claimed. 'He wouldn't stop.' Ms Pekin escaped the cab when it got back into the city of Kuta, when Alafu stalked after her again. 'He loped after me... he was laughing - he was taunting me,' she told ACA. It was only after another man, believed to be a fellow Australian, saw Ms Pekin was distressed and stepped in to help her. Ms Pekin said she tried to escaped from her alleged attacker by getting a cab back into the middle of Kuta, but he forced his way into the back of the car and  allegedly raped her a second time . 'I wish I could find that man... he deserves a medal, that man saved my life,' Ms Pekin said. Ms Pekin's sister, Frances, discovered her on the floor of her hotel room hours later. 'She wasn't even on the bed - she was next to the bed crying, shaking... in that moment I knew something, the worst had happened,' Frances Pekin said, according to the report. The family rushed Ms Pekin to hospital, where doctors found her entire body covered in bruises. 'He was crushing me, he nearly suffocated me... He could have killed me,' Ms Pekin said. 'It's so hard to get justice here,' Dawn Pekin (left) said. 'Men like him will cross path with many women. Don't think it can't happen to you' The 19-year-old then had a 'virginity test' at Sanglah Hospital, which she said was similar to a 'third assault'. 'The test was horrible, It was invasive... It was painful.' The test not only confirmed to police Ms Pekin had been raped, but it also revealed she had contracted a sexually transmitted infection in the attack. The Pekin family's torment was worsened by the fact the alleged predator was allowed to escape the country, and remains on-the-run. Alafu lured Ms Pekin back to where his property away from the bustling tourist centre of the city, and brutally raped her on two separate occasions,  according to ACA . A number of Facebook posts by Alafu, under a different name, including a picture he uploaded of the two together the night before, led to the Pekins family to believe it 'evident' he was the man who allegedly attacked their daughter. Police were in possession of Alafu's phone number, Facebook profile and current address, but the Pekin family says they did not do enough. 'It's just so hard to know what to do,' Ms Pekin's father, Karl, said. 'It's incredibly frustrating... They could have picked him up - he was still a threat. 'It's clear who he was, clear where he was, so we don't know why he wasn't picked up.' It was not until January 12, 18 days after the alleged attack, an attempt to arrest the Nigerian national. 'We're terrified. He's still free - we don't know if he is going to rock up on our doorstep,' Ms Pekin said . Four of Alafu's friends were arrested in a raid on the property on January 14, however it is believed he had escaped by that point. Police tracking revealed his phone was later used in Jakarta before being deactivated. His Facebook account was later opened from Nigeria. The Pekin family was paid more than $14,000 in legal fees over four days to proceed with the case. 'I think Bali is a lawless country,' Ms Pekin said. 'It has laws when it feels like it.' Police were in possession of Alafu's phone number, Facebook profile and current address . The family also called on the Australian government to help bring their daughter's attacker to justice. 'The Indonesian authorities have asked us why the AFP hasn't done anything, and it's a good question,' Mr Pekin said. The AFP said it did not have jurisdiction in the case, according to A Current Affair. According to the report, the Department of Foreign Affairs said it supplied comprehensive consular assistance to the family, but would not comment on an active investigation. 'It's incredibly frustrating... They could have picked him up - he was still a threat.'It's clear who he was, clear where he was, so we don't know why he wasn't picked up,' Mr Pekin said . The Pekin family said the country's lax policing of the problem means it is only a matter of time before another similar attack occurs. 'If you can rape a woman in Bali and just walk straight out of the country, that's not a deterrent, that's an invitation,' Dawn Pekin told the program. 'Either you get a cheap holiday, or you can have a safe one,' the 19-year-old Ms Pekin said. 'You can't have both.' Interpol was notified last week that Alafu is a wanted man. The Pekins are currently waiting for Interpol to issue a red notice for his arrest, which would allow the Australian government to push for Mr Alafu's arrest.

"Players' chief Gordon Taylor insists Raheem Sterling is not being disloyal to Liverpool by putting any further talks about a new contract on hold until the summer. The 20-year-old England player has been made what manager Brendan Rodgers described as 'an incredible offer', believed to be £100,000-a-week, but negotiations have ended in stalemate. Sterling has insisted he is not a 'money grabber' and Taylor, chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association, believes waiting until the season is over before resuming talks could be a wise move. Raheem Sterling admitted in a TV interview that he is not ready to sign a new contract at Liverpool . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers described the £100,000-a-week contract offer as an 'incredible offer' PFA Chief executive Gordon Taylor has defended Sterling for postponing contract negotiations . Taylor said: 'I don't think it's meant to be a sign of disloyalty to Liverpool. 'Even Steven Gerrard, a Liverpool man all his career, had to think about his situation from time to time when there was a great deal of interest in him from other clubs. 'As a player with two years left on his contract he's obviously entitled to consider his options. 'It is a little bit untidy however when the negotiating is taking place in the full glare of the media. 'It's the nature of the game now and it is not necessarily a bad thing for both the club and the player to concentrate on football and leave things on the contract until the end of the season. Sterling has been linked with a move to Arsenal and leading clubs in Spain . Sterling scored for England in their Euro 2016 qualifier with Lithuania on Friday evening . 'They will want to focus on the run-in, the race for the top four and the Champions League places, and the FA Cup as well, and sometimes contract negotiations are the last thing you want to be worrying about.' Taylor added that he was confident Sterling was aware of what he owed to Liverpool and Rodgers. He said: 'Raheem has got to feel very close to Liverpool and he will be aware that they have looked after him, that the manager Brendan Rodgers has put his faith in him and given him his opportunity.'","Sterling's talks with Liverpool over new deal have ended in stalemate .

"Living near congested roads with high levels of air pollution can cause ‘silent strokes’ which increase the risk of dementia, scientists have warned. Exposure to small, sooty particles, mostly caused by traffic fumes and factory emissions, alters the structure of the brain, they said. The microscopic particles have previously been shown to cause lung damage and harmful changes in blood vessels and clotting, and are thought to contribute to the deaths of 29,000 people every year in Britain. Living near a congested road can increase the chance of developing dementia, research has found . Researchers examined the brains of more than 900 people aged more than 60 and assessed the pollution risk . US researchers found evidence that living near congested roads or polluted areas can lead to ‘silent strokes’ which in turn cause shrinkage of the brain and other damage. Silent strokes, which arise from blockages in blood vessels supplying the brain, do not have any outward symptoms and the victim is usually unaware of them. Sudha Seshadri, a professor of neurology at Boston University School of Medicine, said: ‘This is concerning, since we know that silent strokes increase the risk of overt strokes and of developing dementia, walking problems and depression. ‘We now plan to look more at the impact of air pollution over a longer period, its effect on brain shrinkage over time, and other risks including stroke and dementia.’ The study, by Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Boston University School of Medicine, involved more than 900 people aged 60 and over who did not have dementia or a history of strokes. It recorded how far participants lived from major roads and used satellite imagery to assess their exposure to the fine particulate matter known as PM2.5. This is made up of small particles measuring just 2.5 micrometres, or 30 times smaller than the thickness of a human hair. These particles are generated from a variety of sources, including power plants, factories, trucks and cars and the burning of wood. They can travel deeply into the lungs and have been associated with increased numbers of hospital admissions for heart attacks and strokes. The study participants’ brain matter was measured using MRI scans. The researchers found that increases in PM2.5 in towns and cities was linked with a 46 per cent higher risk of silent strokes. The research was published in a report in the journal Stroke. Researcher Elissa Wilker, of the Cardiovascular Epidemiology Research Unit at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, said: ‘This is one of the first studies to look at the relationship between ambient air pollution and brain structure. ‘Our findings suggest that air pollution is associated with insidious effects, even in dementia and stroke-free individuals. ‘The mechanisms remain unclear, but inflammation resulting from the deposit of fine particles in the lungs is likely important.’ The study will add to mounting pressure on the Government, which faces a judgment at the Supreme Court next week over its failure to meet EU legal limits for air pollution. Sixteen cities – including London, Manchester, Glasgow, Sheffield and Birmingham – have failed to hit air quality targets.","American researchers examined more than 900 people aged 60 and over .

"A family-friendly coffee shop had its Facebook page hacked and flooded with pornography after an employee clicked on a malicious link in an email. Staff at Scooter's Coffee, in Omaha, were locked out of the page for almost 24 hours, starting at 5pm on Sunday, by an 'unknown third party' who then took control of the picture feed. Instead of the usual images of smoothies, coffees and cookies, the page was plastered with adult cartoons - similar to those posted on Delta Air Lines and Crayola's pages after they were hacked. Scooter's Coffee, Omaha, issued this apology to customers on its Facebook page after it was hijacked by hackers for 24 hours who used it to post pornography . Scooter's said that the images which appeared on their Facebook page were similar to the images that were posted on Crayola's page when they were hacked in January (pictured) From 5pm Sunday until almost the same time the next day, followers of the Scooter's Facebook page were sent links such as this one, instead of the regular images of smoothies and cookies . After trying to contact officials at Facebook with limited success, it was not until a day later that the company managed to kick the hacker out, and regain control of the account. Jamie Hamburg, spokesman for the company, said: 'At approximately 5pm CST on Sunday, 29 March, the Scooter's Coffee Facebook page was hacked by an unknown third party. 'The offensive content that has been posted as a result of this hack is similar to that seen in other recent breaches of major brands. 'Scooter's Coffee would like to apologize to our loyal Facebook audience and anyone that has been affected by this inappropriate content.' The hack is believed to have come after an employee clicked on a link of a direct message sent through Facebook itself. The hacker then kicked the member of staff out of the page, locked it, and began posting. Scooter's Coffee said that, despite repeated attempts to contact Facbook, and hundreds of reports being sent about inappropriate content, nobody at the social media network responded. It was only by contacting larger businesses that they were able to get in touch with Facebook, who removed the content and restored the page nearly 24 hours later. All of the images have now been removed, and Scooter's have offered apologies to thier customers via their Facebook and Twitter pages . It is thought that the hack occurred after an employee clicked on a link in an email which purported to be from Facebook. Hackers were then able to gather enough data to allow them to take control of the page . Crayon manufacturer Crayola was caught out by a similar breach in January, when hackers took control of the page to post pictures of cartoon breasts, and links to adult websites. One post included a link to a drawing of a scantily clad female cartoon character from the DreamWorks movie 'The Road to El Dorado' - with the words 'If Disney Was For Adults.' Delta Air Lines was also affected the following month in a similar attack involving a link to a sexually explicit joke. Their page was hijacked for around an hour, during which 'objectionable and offensive content', similar to that in the Crayola and Scooter's hacks, was published.","Staff were locked out of Scooter's Coffee page starting at 5pm on Sunday .

"The future of travel will be virtual. Never again will you need to board a plane to be able to take in the world's most breathtaking locales, at least if Facebook has anything to say about it. In a recent Q&A on the social media site, CEO and co-founder, Mark Zuckerberg, opened up about the future of travel and how virtual reality will play a key role. According to Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, the future of travel lies in sharing virtual reality environments . 'It will be pretty wild,' Zuckerberg replied to a follower online, according to arynews.tv. 'Just like we capture photos and videos today and then share them on the Internet to let others experience them too, we'll be able to capture whole 3D scenes and create new environments and then share those with people as well.' Zuckerberg's views of the future of virtual travel are perhaps unsurprising, considering that the social media giant purchased virtual reality headset maker, Oculus, last year. And at a conference in San Francisco last month, Facebook's chief technology officer, Mike Schroepfer, promised that virtual reality gaming would be coming 'this year.' Never again will you need to endure a long-haul flight to take in some of Thailand's best beaches . Thanks to the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset, users will be able to see the world from multiple viewpoints . Facebook also announced plans to begin supporting virtual reality on its newsfeed, meaning that users will be able to put on a VR headset and explore a location of their choosing. These videos are expected to be filmed with multiple cameras, so users will be able to change their viewpoints, allowing for even more in-depth exploration. Described as a 'first step,' it's also believed that even more immersive videos are on the horizon, including those which will use Oculus Rift, the virtual reality headset that straps over your eyes. 'VR is more than just another platform, it can create a whole range of human experiences,' said Michael Abrash, the Chief Scientist at Oculus. The Facebook founder isn't the first to predict virtual reality as the future of travel. Marriott hotels have already trialled Oculus Rift on a tour of hotels across America, allowing guests to sample different holiday destinations.","In recent Facebook Q&A, Zuckerberg discussed the future of travel .

"A 17 year-old college student could face a battle with Instagram after hacking the popular photo-sharing app. Caleb Benn, a Californian high school student, recently developed a $4.99 (£3.24) app for iOS devices using Instagram's application program interface. Called 'Uploader for Instagram', it allows users to upload photos to Instagram directly from their computer rather than using only their smartphone. Caleb Benn, a Californian high school student, has developed a $4.99 (£3.24) app for iOS devices using Instagram's application program interface (screen shot pictured). Now, the 17 year-old student could face a battle with Instagram over hackings its API . According Jillian Eugenios at CNNMoney, the teenager is currently making $1,000 (£675.70) a day from the app – and Instagram isn't happy. An engineer from Facebook, which owns Instagram, sent Benn an email last week claiming the app violated the company's terms of service. The email asked Benn to 'fix' the app by Monday, but Benn said doing this would make the app would be pointless. 'To be honest, I wasn't nonplussed when I got the email from Facebook,' Benn told DailyMail.com. 'I knew my app was playing in a legal gray area, and I suspected Facebook would find out about it somehow.' Facebook has strict restrictions against using its private API. An engineer from Instagram allegedly sent Benn an email last week, claiming the app violated the company's terms of service. Pictured on the right is a screenshot of the 'Uploader for Instagram' service . Chris Messina, a Silicon Valley technologist told CNNMoney the problem is that accessing the API 'opens up possibilities for all kinds of abuse, from spambots or people uploading stuff from other channels.' One in five Instagram users now combine their photos into a single image before uploading it to the app. To capitalise on this, the Californian firm has launched its latest standalone app called Layout that lets people create such collages with up to nine images and 11 combinations. Photos can be selected from the phone's camera roll, or taken with the Photo Booth tool, and Layouts can then be 'remixed' and edited with mirror effects and flips. The Layout app has four main features called Faces, Mirroring, Photo Booth and Previews. Users begin by selecting as many images, up to the maximum of nine, to feature in the collage. Photos can be selected or deselected at any point. As they add more images, the layout of the collage changes and photos can be dragged between sections and different sized boxes as desired. These photos can then be zoomed, flipped to form a mirror image, or turned upside down. He added, if Instagram wanted users to post from a computer, they can do so themselves. 'I was initially inspired to create the app because I saw a sincerely lacking feature for the desktop,' Benn said. 'I know Instagram purposely left out the uploading feature from the web interface to keep the social network’s unique, mobile-centered ecosystem intact. Instagram did release a web version of its software, called 'Your Instagram Feed on the Web' in February 2013. This allowed users to comment on each other's photos from a desktop, but the photo sharing site still does not allow uploaded of images from a PC. To combat the problem, some Instagram fans have installed special software, such as BlueStacks App Player, designed to simulate a mobile phone operating system on their computer. Uploader for Instagram offers a simpler workaround, and it is already garnering positive reviews on the App store. One user wrote: 'For my job, we post eight to ten Instagram pictures a week that are first designed on the computer. 'So it's always been a bit of a nuisance to transfer the image over to my phone then upload to Instagram. This app takes care of that.' Instagram, which Facebook acquired in 2012 for $1 billion, has 300 million monthly users. A spokesperson for Instagram declined to comment to DailyMail.com about the developments. Benn told DailyMail.com: 'I’ve played a few of my last cards, and now I’m just going to wait for Facebook to play theirs. 'I have no idea how this entire ordeal is going to end, but at least I know that I helped make a handful of people’s lives easier–and I think that that is worth all of the trouble.'

"A 16-year-old boy who was seized in an anti-terror operation after he tried to buy deadly poison on the internet has been spared jail after the court heard he wanted to commit suicide. The teenager from Mossley, Greater Manchester, who cannot be named for legal reasons, ordered the deadly toxin off the 'dark web'. He was unaware his online requests were being tracked by covert counter-terrorism officers who feared he was planning an attack. The teenager pleaded guilty to trying to buy the toxin at Manchester Youth Court earlier this month. A 16-year-old boy who was seized in an anti-terror operation after he tried to buy deadly poison on the internet has been spared jail after the court heard he wanted to commit suicide . But he claimed he was attempting to buy the deadly poison because he wanted to commit suicide and was sentenced to a 12 month referral order. Officers from the North West Counter Terrorism Unit started investigating the teenager in January when they received information that he was attempting to obtain the poison. Officers were in contact with the boy over the dark web - a subsection of deep web which is not indexed by standard search engines so users are less likely to be monitored. During their covert communication he expressed an interest in buying the poison and also showed an awareness of its toxicity and potential for use in causing harm. The teenager pleaded guilty to trying to buy the toxin at Manchester Youth Court (pictured) earlier this month . The 16-year-old  attempted to place an order on February 6 and also suggested he would make future purchases in larger quantities. Officers raided two homes in Tameside on February 16 and the 16-year-old boy was arrested. A 16-year-old girl was also arrested as part of the investigation but later released without charge. The dark web is a subsection of the deep web - the part of the internet that does not show up in searches or on social media. Most of the information on the web is far down on dynamically generated sites, unable to be found or seen by traditional search engines. The dark web is used as a way of sharing information and trading goods, but the anonymous and encrypted nature of it has attracted large amounts of illegal activity. The Silk Road website, and its successor that were recently shut down, was used to sell drugs in exchange for Bitcoins. Other dark net sites let users share pornographic photographs, hacked information and credit card numbers. Det Sgt Russell Stubbs said after the case: 'The teenager at the centre of this investigation is clearly a vulnerable, troubled young man and I hope now that this case is concluded he can get the help and support he needs to turn his life around. 'Thanks to the vigilance of officers from a number of different law enforcement agencies, we were able to intervene before this young man did get hold of such a deadly substance from a genuine seller. 'I want to reassure our communities that the North West Counter Terrorism Unit and local police are well aware of the potential dangers associated with internet activity on the 'dark web'. Law enforcement agencies use a range of investigative techniques to monitor and police unlawful internet activity. 'I would also urge parents of children to keep a very close eye on what their children are doing. Security measures are available to block certain sites and if you suspect your child is spending too much time on the Internet and you notice sudden changes in their behaviour then please report it. 'As in this case, the sooner we are able to identify someone either at risk or using the 'dark web' for criminal purposes the better chance we have to consider appropriate intervention options.' Last year, a graphic designer who fantasised about poisoning her mother after she forbade her from marrying the man became the first person to be prosecuted under the Biological Weapons Act. Kuntal Patel, from Stratford, east London, had wished her 'selfish and controlling' mother Meena Patel dead after the 61-year-old was 'hell-bent' on breaking up her engagement, a court was told. During the trial at Southwark Crown Court, the court heard the 37-year-old contacted a dealer in the U.S through the 'dark web' and said she needed a 'tasteless' and deadly toxin to get her mother 'out of the way'.

"(CNN)A mammoth wave of snow darkens the sky over Everest Base Camp. Appearing like a white mushroom cloud roaring over the climbers, they scurry as their tents flap like feathers in the wind. Then panic hits. ""Whoa! Whoa!"" Screams and expletives are heard. The few people in the video scatter and dive into a tent as the deluge of snow falls over them. Cursing and breathing heavily, they wait until the pounding is over. After a while, they scream to each other, ""Are you all right?"" ""Are you OK?"" The camera jostles back and forth as German climber Jost Kobusch heaves to catch his breath. Nearly 4,000 dead in Nepal earthquake . When they finally emerge from their avalanche ordeal, their faces are scarlet and their bodies crusted in snow. They trudge away, completely dazed and shocked. ""The ground was shaking from the earthquake and as soon as we saw people running, we were running ourselves to save our lives,"" Kobusch wrote in a post on his YouTube video. The harrowing two-minute clip shows the unimaginable scale of the avalanche that smashed into Everest Base Camp on Saturday. At least 17 people have been killed, with dozens injured and several missing -- likely buried beneath the snow and ice. The fates of the climbers and the local hires are one part of the enormous human toll in Nepal from the catastrophic quake that has so far claimed the lives of more than 4,300 people. At least 8,000 people were reported to have suffered injuries. Helicopters brought stranded climbers off the mountain Monday amid growing concern for the groups stuck around 20,000 feet (6,100 meters) high in Camps 1 and 2. The climbers who were higher up Everest appeared to have avoided the deadly avalanche that struck Base Camp, but many -- estimated to be in the hundreds -- could not descend on their own. The climbers can't head down because the dangerous Khumbu Icefall has been ravaged by a series of aftershocks. The aftershocks sent snow and rocks thundering down the mountainside, complicating rescue efforts. Tshering Sherpa, who manages the icefall route, estimated that 100 to 200 people were stuck in the higher camps after the avalanche. ""Bottom line, the icefall has been deemed impassable at this point,"" said Alan Arnette, a climber and Everest blogger who was at Camp 2 when the avalanche struck. He said that climbers at Camp 2 and others higher up would descend to Camp 1 (elevation 19,500 feet) to await helicopters. Arnette was helicoptered down to Base Camp on Monday. Witnesses said three helicopters rescued climbers and Sherpas from Camp 1, taking two people down at a time. Carsten Pedersen, a Danish climber at Base Camp, said that he heard a steady stream of helicopters ferrying people from the mountains back to Base Camp throughout the morning. ""They land every 10 minutes here,"" Pedersen said. ""I estimate half the people have been rescued, and it's probably less than 200 people in the mountain this morning. I wouldn't be surprised if 100 people came down already."" The window for helicopter rescue was expected to be between 9 a.m. and noon Monday. The helicopter rescues are heavily contingent on the weather. Jim Davidson, a climber on Everest, tweeted that the evacuations were going well. Down at Base Camp, Jamlins Sherpa said he counted about 22 body bags that were to be transported back to their families in Kathmandu. The death toll on Everest is still unclear. In an audio blog recorded from Camp 2, Arnette signed off with this message: ""It's important, it's not about mountaineering. This is about the earth and it's a horrible loss of life at Everest Base Camp and down at Kathmandu. ""It's a massive loss of life."" A member of Arnette's team, Eve Girawong, a medic from New Jersey who worked on the mountain, was killed at Base Camp, according to her family and employer. Several Everest climbing teams have confirmed deaths. Five Nepali staff members were killed at Everest Base Camp and Camp 1, according to Adventure Consultants. It did not identify the staffers. Three Sherpas from the 360 Expeditions team died, the company posted on its Facebook page. Their names were also not revealed. The foreign casualties at Everest Base Camp include Dan Fredinburg, an American executive at Google who died after suffering a major head injury, and Tom Taplin, a documentary filmmaker from California. ""He was blown away by the blast rather than being buried in any rubble,"" Taplin's wife, Corey Freyer, told CNN affiliate KABC. The exact number of dead remains unclear. CNN's Jessica King, Jethro Mullen, journalists Wayne Chang and Naomi Ng contributed to this report.","A YouTube video shows the scale of an avalanche on Mount Everest on Saturday .

"Turkey has blocked access to Twitter and YouTube after they refused a request to remove pictures of a prosecutor held during an armed siege last week. A Turkish court imposed the blocks because images of the deadly siege were being shared on social media and 'deeply upset' the wife and children of Mehmet Selim Kiraz, the hostage who was killed. The 46-year-old Turkish prosecutor died in hospital when members of the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front (DHKP-C) stormed a courthouse and took him hostage. The DHKP-C is considered a terrorist group by Turkey, the European Union and US. Scroll down for video . A Turkish court has blocked access to Twitter and YouTube after they refused a request to remove pictures of prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz held during an armed siege last week . Grief: The family of Mehmet Selim Kiraz grieve over his coffin during his funeral at Eyup Sultan Mosque in Istanbul, Turkey. He died in hospital after he was taken hostage by the far-left organisation . Two of his captors were killed when security forces took back the building where the far-left group was holding him. Gunshots were heard and smoke could be seen rising from the scene at the end of the six-hour stand-off. Mr Kiraz, a father-of-two married to a judge who also worked at the courthouse, was targeted for his part in an investigation into the death of Berkin Elvan. The 15-year-old was severely wounded after being hit on the head by a tear-gas canister fired by a police officer during anti-government protests in Istanbul in June 2013. After spending 269 days in a coma, Elvan eventually died on March 11 last year. His death, and the subsequent investigation, have since become a rallying point for the country's far-left. Gathering: Prosecutors, lawyers and judges stand near a statue of Lady Justice during the funeral ceremony . A British national, of Polish origin but who has not been named, was arrested on Saturday as part of an operation against the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front, according to reports. A Foreign Office spokeswoman said this morning: 'I can confirm that a British national has been arrested in Turkey and that we are offering consular assistance.' Before imposing the blocks on the websites, Turkish authorities had tried to prevent newspapers printing images taken during the siege last week. The newspapers were accused by the government of 'spreading terrorist propaganda' in sharing the images of the hostage-taking. Presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said: 'This has to do with the publishing of the prosecutor's . picture. What happened in the aftermath (of the prosecutor's . killing) is as grim as the incident itself. 'The demand from the prosecutor's office is that this image . not be used anywhere in electronic platforms. 'The wife and children of prosecutor Kiraz have been deeply . upset. The images are everywhere.' He added: 'A request has been made to both Twitter and YouTube for the . removal of the images and posts but they have not accepted it . and no response has been given. 'That's why . this decision has been taken through a court in Istanbul.' Critical: Prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz was taken to hospital with gunshot wounds but died of his injuries . Strength of feeling: Elvan has since become an icon for the Turkish far-left and his supporters accuse the authorities of covering up the circumstances and perpetrators of his death . Google said it was working to restore service to the YouTube . video-sharing site, which it owns. Twitter also said it was . working to restore access for its users. Facebook said it had complied with a Turkish court order requiring it to restrict access to some content or face a block on its service. A company spokesman said it would appeal the order. Turkey's telecoms regulator could not immediately be reached . and there was no statement on its website. This is not the first time that Turkish authorities have imposed blocks on social media sites and networks. In the run-up to local elections in March 2014 blocks were imposed after recordings circulated allegedly revealing corruption among senior officials.

"The girlfriend of a teenager with a life-threatening tumour has spoken of how his condition has left him paralysed and unable to dress himself. Jahnae Jackson has put her psychology studies on hold in order to care for her long-term boyfriend, Jackson Byrnes after he was diagnosed with a stage four brain tumour four weeks ago. The 18-year-olds from northern NSW have raised over $80,000 from community generosity for his life-saving surgery to be performed on Wednesday by renowned neurosurgeon Dr. Charlie Teo. 'He's already paralysed and I have to help him do many things, including dress him' Jahnae told Daily Mail Australia. Jackson's girlfriend Jahnae Jackson (right) noticed he had developed a lump three weeks ago and prompted him to visit a doctor who requested an MRI . For the past week Jackson and girlfriend have been desperately raising the sum needed to pay the hospital . Jahnae knew they needed a second opinion, so she hunted online for specialist who was willing . Three weeks ago Jackson was told by doctors that the tumour was too deep and aggressive to be safely operated on. Jahnae knew they needed a second opinion, so she hunted online for a specialist who was willing to perform Jackson's urgent surgery and that's when she found Dr. Charlie Teo from The Prince of Wales Hospital in Sydney. 'I had to be positive for Jackson as I knew there was always a way to help,' she said. On Monday morning they reached the target on their GoFundMe page, and although they still need an additional $45,000 to cover chemotherapy and other hospital fees, they are overwhelmed by the community support from the small town of Casino in northern NSW. 'It's absolutely unbelievable that a small town can do so much,' Jahnae said. 'It makes us feel so much better.' Although Jackson's surgery is likely to save his life, he still has a long road of rehabilitation in front of him as he will be left paralysed for some time. 'I was devastated when I found out, but I couldn't really react,' she said. The 18-year-old completed school at the end of last year and admits she wanted to go to university to study psychology or social work but has put it off due to Jackson's condition. 'I'd rather help my boyfriend out and worry about university later,' she said. Although Jackson's surgery is likely to save his life, he still has a long road of rehabilitation in front of him as he will be left paralysed for some time. Jackson said he has no nerves for the operation and instead wants to get it over and done with . After desperately fundraising for a week and finally reaching his goal, Jackson said he has no nerves for the operation. 'I just want to get in there and get it over and done with,' Jackson told Daily Mail Australia. 'I'm just really thankful to the community as I didn't think we would raise this much money, it all happened so quickly.' Dr Teo, director of Sydney's Centre for Minimally Invasive Neurosurgery, said other surgeons were technically able to perform the surgery but he was the only one prepared to do it. 'People think that it's futile because he's got a malignant tumour and it's very aggressive,' Dr Teo told Daily Mail Australia. 'There's significant weakness down his left side and they think his quality of life is such that he wouldn't want to live anyway.' But Dr Teo said he makes decisions based on what his patients want. For the past week Jackson's family and friends have been desperately trying to raise $80,000 needed to pay the hospital upfront for the risky surgery . Jackson Byrnes was diagnosed with a stage four tumour three weeks ago and needed $80,000 for surgery . Jackson's mother Rhonda Byrnes said she was overwhelmed by the support and money raised by the community on his GoFundMe page, but said the family still needed more . 'If a patient really wants it and knows the risks and understands how risky the operation is I'll usually respect the patient's wishes,' he said . 'He is a lovely boy and he's only young. 'I said ""You know you're going to be paralysed"", I've told him the worst case scenario. 'He understands that and he wants to live.' Dr Teo will try to remove 95 per cent of the tumour, which has extended to very sensitive part of the brain. Dr Teo said the $80,000 payment required for the surgery was standard. Renowned neurosurgeon Dr Charlie Teo is the only surgeon in Australia willing to perform the risky operation that will likely see Jackson paralysed . Jahnae is currently in Sydney with Jackson and his family, preparing for his surgery on Wednesday . 'Most boys his age begin their journey into adulthood with hopes , dreams and anticipation of what lies ahead and excitement of the endless opportunities of what life will bring them,' Mr Byrne's fundraising page on GoFundMe reads. 'It is not a time to be enduring a fight for your life.' Victorian finance, leasing and risk management company Morris Finance have made the largest donation to the cause by pledging $2000. Jahnae is currently in Sydney with Jackson and his family, preparing for his surgery on Wednesday. 'He needs to get some scans on Tuesday and then they will schedule his surgery for the next day,' she said.

"The Revered Al Sharpton appeared on Sunday in North Charleston and is expected to attend a vigil for Walter Scott, the black driver who was fatally shot by a white police officer after he fled a traffic stop. Rev. Sharpton preached at the Charity Missionary Baptist Church and addressed the Scott case and the need for reform around national policing legislation during his sermon. Elected officials and police from North Charleston were in attendance and South Carolina Senator Marlon Kimpson was also there to hear Sharpton speak. Scroll down for video . The Revered Al Sharpton delivered a sermon and addressed the Walter Scott situation on Sunday morning . North Charleston Mayor Keith Summey (left), Police Chief Eddie Driggers (center) and Sharpton 'discussed the Scott shooting' on Sunday before the reverend spoke at Charity Missionary Baptist Church in South Carolina . Sharpton wrote on Facebook: 'Joining us this morning is Mayor Keith Summey, Sheriff Al Cannon, Senator Marlon Kimpson, SCLC Leader Michael Steele, North Charleston Police [Chief] Eddie Driggers, and Assistant Police Chief Reggie Burgess.' The officers and elected officials listened 'intently' to what Sharpton had to say as he gave credit to Mayor Summey for firing Michael Slager, the officer who killed Scott, according to the Post and Courier. During the sermon, Sharpton said: 'When he's wrong ... we protest. 'When he's right, we should have the same courage to say he's right. 'Let us use this hour to not only change what's going on in North Charleston. 'North Charleston, that's known as a place of intolerance, can be the place that could set a new tone in policing all over the United States. 'Maybe now between a southern white mayor and a forgiving black mother, maybe this nation will deal with this.' The civil rights leader is also expected to attend a vigil near the scene of the Scott shooting on Sunday afternoon. Sharpton denied Scott's family barred him from attending his funeral on Saturday because it would cause a 'circus' of media attention. Allegations that Scott's family wanted nothing to do with Sharpton were published by the New York Daily News. In response, Sharpton said: 'There has never been a discussion about me attending or participating in the funeral on Saturday, since everyone knows that [National Action Network's] convention with thousands of delegates is happening in New York and doesn't end until Saturday night.' Scott's casket was wrapped in an American flag at a funeral home in Summerville, South Carolina, on Saturday . Scott (left) was killed by Michael Slage (right).

Judy Scott wipes her eyes as she looks at her son's casket during his burial service in Summerville yesterday . Hundreds of mourners attended the funeral for Scott, 50, on Saturday in Summerville, north of North Charleston where the shooting took place. Sharpton remained in New York where his National Action Network was wrapping up its national convention. Slager, 33, the North Charleston officer who fired eight times at Scott's back as he fled from a traffic stop, has been charged with murder and dismissed from the police force. Slager pulled Scott's black Mercedes-Benz over for a broken tail light. Video from the dashboard camera in Slager's police cruiser recorded a respectful exchange between the two men before the officer returned to his patrol car. A few minutes later, after being told by Slager to stay in the Mercedes, the man emerged from his car and ran off. Scott, who was apparently unarmed, had a history of arrests for failing to pay child support. A cellphone video taken by a bystander showed the men in a brief tussle before Scott ran off again, Slager fired his gun and Scott slumped into the grass. There was a gap between the two videos, however, as the officer was not wearing a body camera. Scott's shooting was one of the latest in a series of killings that have stoked a national outcry over police use of force against African Americans. Last year, the fatal shooting of an unarmed black man in Ferguson, Missouri, and choking death of a black man in New York City triggered a wave of demonstrations across the country.","Reverend Sharpton was expected to appear Sunday in North Charleston .

"West Brom manager Tony Pulis will receive a hero's welcome when he returns to Crystal Palace on Saturday but in the midst of yet another relegation battle for the 57-year-old, he must wonder if he'll ever be successful at the right end of the Premier League. For all the expertise Pulis has in keeping clubs in the top flight, a talent that has the everlasting gratitude of Stoke City and Palace supporters, his overall record is one of the worst of any long-serving Premier League manager. This is his seventh season in the top flight and he's never finished in the top half of the table. If, as expected, Garry Monk's Swansea City don't drop lower than 10th, Pulis will be the only manager in the Premier League with more than 12 months experience who has never finished higher than 11th. Tony Pulis has never managed to guide a team into the top half of the Premier League . To add to his frustration as he takes the applause of the Palace fans who remember him for masterminding their great escape last season, Pulis will know he isn't yet guaranteed preserving his proud record of never being relegated. West Brom's home defeats against QPR and Leicester City have left them stuck on 33 points. That is still seven points above the bottom three but with four of their final five fixtures after the weekend coming against Liverpool, Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal, there is not much wriggle-room. For many, producing statistics to suggest Pulis could have produced better results is heresy. He won promotion with Stoke City and got them to an FA Cup final. He turned Palace's season around 12 months ago and is still favoured to keep Albion up this time. Pulis did an excellent job in turning around Palace's fortunes last season . Palace fans were pleased with the job Pulis did in his time at Selhurst Park . He is known as a good organiser, a smart tactician and someone who is able to get the best out of players and bend the laws of the game to his advantage. And yet, why has he never finished higher than 11th, achieved in 2009/10 with Stoke and 20013/14 with Palace? It is right to say he has never had the best clubs with the most money to manage and yet Sam Allardyce finished sixth with Bolton, Mark Hughes sixth with Blackburn Rovers, Mauricio Pochettino eighth with Southampton and Monk is currently eighth with Swansea City. None of them giants of the game. Pulis took Stoke into the Premier League and turned them into an established team . Pardew, who has achieved a similar miracle at Palace this season to what Pulis achieved last season, has a top-five finish at Newcastle United on his cv. Two years ago, Stoke City effectively sacked Pulis, acknowledging the huge contribution he made to the club but feeling he couldn't take them any further. Hughes now has the club sitting in 10th place, higher than Pulis achieved, and on a smaller wages budget. Alan Pardew could guide Crystal Palace into the top half of the table just as Mark Hughes could do at Stoke  - something Pulis never achieved . Pulis will remain plain-speaking til the end. The Welshman won't be able to enjoy his visit to Palace given the importance of the game. 'We need a 90 minutes from the players. I don't care what anyone says, everyone has a go in this division and the lads have to understand that. 'What we have to do is get back to basics and defend properly. Lower league mistakes cost you goals.' You'd back Pulis' message to keep West Brom up. Whether he can take them to a higher level next season is another question.

"Tony Pulis believes Joey Barton 'probably had a point' when claiming West Bromwich Albion's players 's*** themselves' during defeat to Queens Park Rangers earlier this season. In December West Brom were two goals up but lost to a Charlie Austin hat-trick, leading to Barton's scathing judgement and plunging Alan Irvine to the brink of the sack. Barton said then: 'West Brom went 2-0 up and I turned to Dunney (Richard Dunne) and said, 'they've scored too early.' They don't know how to get over the finishing line.'

'The club were 2-0 up and lost 3-2 so he most probably had a point, or he felt he had a point to say something on that subject.' Pulis recalled his own misfortune from leading 2-0 and losing as Gillingham manager in the Second Division play-off final of 1999. 'I've managed teams that have been 2-0 up with only for or five minutes to go and ended up drawing then losing on penalties. 1999 Man City Wembley,' he added. 'So I can't talk about being indestructible in respect to leads. 'We've played really well I don't think they've just been good results. The performances have been really, really good.

"Ed Miliband (pictured yesterday at the Shree Swaminarayan Temple, north London) is pressing on with his controversial cap rents, despite warnings from experts that plans will backfire . Labour's plans to impose rent controls are ‘economically illiterate’ and will slash investment in new housing, leading to more tenants being evicted by their landlords, experts warned last night. Ed Miliband yesterday confirmed he would press on with controversial plans to cap rents despite warnings from housing experts, business and even Labour figures that they will backfire. He said rent controls – demanded by the militant Unite union that bankrolls Labour – would give millions of ‘forgotten’ renters a fairer deal by helping those stuck in so-called Generation Rent by soaring house prices. But the Generation Rent campaign group said his plans were ‘riddled with loopholes’ and may make tenants’ lives worse. Under the proposals, landlords would have to offer three-year tenancies and would be banned from raising rent above inflation during this time. Alex Hilton, director of Generation Rent, said long tenancies were welcome but the proposal would give landlords an incentive to evict their tenants and would not keep rent down, adding: ‘This is because they have no plans to limit rent rises between tenancies – or after your first three years are up. ‘Worse than this, Labour’s planning new ways for landlords to evict you within that period, for example to sell your home or get it back for other reasons. These loopholes are scary when you think they’re attached to a big financial incentive to use them – because that’s the only way they will be able to put rent up in the first three years.’ In another loophole, hundreds of thousands of properties owned by buy-to-let investors could be excluded altogether. Most buy-to-let mortgages specify maximum tenancies of one year. Labour sources said these landlords would be able to offer short tenancies ‘where contractually obliged’. Senior Tories called the proposal ‘drivel’ and said it would suppress house building and push rents up. Chancellor George Osborne described the plan as a ‘totally economically-illiterate statement that grabs headlines, but is dismissed by every expert who looks at it’. The Confederation of British Industry said the way to tackle the housing crisis was to build more homes, and warned the plans could discourage investment, thereby forcing up rents in the long term. The Labour leader said rent controls – demanded by the militant Unite union that bankrolls Labour – would give millions of ‘forgotten’ renters a fairer deal by helping those stuck in so-called Generation Rent . Senior Tories called the proposal ‘drivel’ and said it would suppress house building and push rents up. Pictured: Mr Miliband and Boris Johnson on the Andrew Marr show today . Some senior Labour figures also have concerns, with former minister Tessa Jowell warning against a cap last week, saying: ‘Before taking a step like that you have to be clear it doesn’t have unintended consequences.’ Yesterday, however, she insisted she supported the plan. Housing spokesman Emma Reynolds was forced on the back foot yesterday after footage emerged of her in 2013 saying: ‘I don’t think rent controls are going to work in practice.’ Yesterday, she said she meant ‘Seventies-style controls’ and said Labour’s plan was different. Rent controls were widely blamed for a reduction in rented housing in Britain and Europe in the Seventies as investment dried up. The bad old days: A Manchester slum . Rent controls have already proved a disaster in Britain after they were introduced in the First World War. The measure was supposed to be temporary – but was only dismantled by Margaret Thatcher in the Eighties. During this time the private rented sector collapsed from 90 per cent of the country’s housing stock to less than 10 per cent. By the Seventies, rent controls were widely blamed for the slum conditions in much of Britain’s remaining private rented stock. Landlords, unable to make a sustainable return, neglected homes and dragged their feet over the most basic repairs. Unscrupulous operators such as Peter Rachman, whose name became a byword for exploitation, drove out tenants who had legal rent protection to replace them with others who were not covered by the law. Gordon Brown’s favourite economist Paul Krugman, a Nobel prize-winner, has warned that attempts to control rent always fail, writing: ‘Almost every freshman-level textbook contains a case study on rent control, using its known adverse side-effects to illustrate the principles of supply and demand.’ The socialist Swedish economist Assar Lindbeck once said: ‘Next to bombing, rent control seems in many cases to be the most efficient technique for destroying cities.’ Alan Ward, of the Residential Landlords Association, warned that rent controls could result in a return to the ugly conditions of the past, adding they ‘would lessen investment in new homes when we need more and serve only to paper over cracks in the market’. He said: ‘For some, it is easier to achieve a cheap political point by calling for rent controls than provide a prescription for growth in the private rented sector. Ultimately, tenants would lose as they find themselves forced into slums rented by Rachman landlords operating outside the legal market.’ David Cox, of the Association of Residential Letting Agents, said rent controls led to a fall in supply and the standard of homes because ‘landlords do not have the money to invest in ongoing maintenance’. Sam Bowman, of the Adam Smith Institute think-tank, said rent controls were ‘a stunningly bad idea that could clobber renters’. He said they would give landlords a huge incentive to raise rents at the start of a tenancy, adding: ‘Labour has unwittingly announced a policy that could devastate cities and exacerbate the housing crisis.’ The Institute of Economic Affairs said the proposal ‘would result in higher rents, a reduction in the quality of rented property and in the supply of homes to rent without improving affordability’.

"Police have dropped an investigation into a vicious assault on a huntsman just three months after it took place – despite a wealth of evidence pointing to the identity of a suspected attacker. Last night the victim, Mike Lane, 40, who was beaten by balaclava-clad protesters armed with iron bars on ropes, condemned the decision by police as ‘pathetic’. He said: ‘They could have made more effort. Everyone is very disappointed. I’ve been told that unless further evidence comes forward, the attackers are not likely to be found. We find it pathetic.’ Attack: Mike Lane,40, who is joint master of the Tedworth Hunt,  on the ground during the confrontation with hunt saboteurs . A video of the incident and a dossier of evidence, including some names of saboteurs and their car registration numbers, was given to Wiltshire Police after the assault. The attack at Everleigh, near Amesbury, took place even though the 30 riders and their hounds were chasing only an artificial scent, rather than a fox. During the incident, Mr Lane, who is joint master of the Tedworth Hunt, was sent flying to the ground, before being kicked in the head. He was admitted to hospital with concussion and broken teeth and his face was swollen. Since the attack he has suffered memory loss. The face of the thug who kicked Mr Lane was captured on video. Following the attack, Wiltshire Police issued the suspect’s photograph, although he has not been identified. In an exclusive interview with The Mail on Sunday, Mr Lane said: ‘I’ve been told by police they are shelving their inquiries due to insufficient evidence. It’s angered us because we gave them evidence. I’m beginning to lose my trust in the police.’ Wiltshire Police confirmed they had stopped the investigation pending further information, but their failure to identify, charge or prosecute anyone involved has dismayed hunt supporters across the country. This is the face of the main suspect . On the day of the attack, January 24, about 15 protesters sprayed hounds with the perfumed chemical citronella to distract them from the scent. Mr Lane said: ‘I noticed they parked about 250 yards away. Then five came towards us. They were looking for trouble – it was a hardcore element we’d not seen before. ‘They were abusive and then one spat at me and then punched me in the face. A scuffle broke out and I slipped and one started kicking me in the head, stamped on me and the heel of his steel toe-capped trainer stuck in my mouth. I was knocked out for a few minutes. Then the chap started swinging a rope with an iron bar.’ Mr Lane, who has paid £500 for dental treatment since the attack, added: ‘I feel let down and think the police could have done more.’ Karen Fieldsend, 42, who made the call to police, is furious that the case has been dropped. ‘It’s disgraceful,’ she said. ‘If you had people assaulted in a city centre, something would be done, but in the countryside people forget about it.’ James Cameron, 53, vice-chairman of the Tedworth Hunt, added: ‘Their decision is disappointing, but this highlights how difficult it is for police to do their job when saboteurs turn up wearing face coverings.’ The Countryside Alliance is campaigning to ban saboteurs from wearing a face covering so criminals can be brought to justice. Last night a spokesman for Wiltshire Police said: ‘We have been unable to move the inquiry further forward. At this stage the case has been recorded as undetected, however should other evidence come to light then it will be re-opened.’","Mike Lane was beaten by masked protesters armed with iron bars on ropes .

"Juventus have ruled out a move for Manchester United loan star Radamel Falcao after claiming the Colombia striker's wages are 'beyond their means'. Falcao has endured a difficult period at Old Trafford after arriving in an expensive loan deal from Monaco last summer. The 29-year-old is unlikely to remain at the club after scoring only four goals and failing to force his way into Louis van Gaal's starting XI. Juventus general manager Beppe Marotta has claimed that Falcao wanted to come to Turin last summer but the Serie A champions have now taken themselves out of the race to sign him. Radamel Falcao (right) has scored only four goals since arriving at Manchester United from Monaco . The Colombian is expected to leave in the summer, although Juventus claim they cannot afford him . 'Falcao is a Monaco player on loan at Manchester United and his wages are substantial and beyond our means,' Marotta told La Gazzetta dello Sport. 'It's utopian to imagine him in a Juventus shirt.' However, Marotta did claim the Italians, who reached the Champions League semi-finals at the expense of Monaco on Wednesday, were interested in strike pair Paulo Dybala and Edinson Cavani. With former Manchester City striker Carlos Tevez set to return to Boca Juniors at the end of the season, Juventus need to reinforce their forward line with Palermo's Dybala and Edinson of Paris Saint Germain at the top of their wishlist. The Serie A champions have expressed an interest in highly rated Palermo youngster Paulo Dybala . With Dybala rated at £35m, PSG's unsettled striker Edinson Cavani could be a cheaper alternative . 'We do like Dybala and he is one of our objectives,' Marotta said. 'I won't hide the fact that I have met with [Palermo president Maurizio] Zamparini -- even if I do go and deny it, he will only blurt it out anyway. 'He's a great player, but alongside him you need experienced players too. We're trying to find an agreement with Zamparini for this player who we like, but we're not the only ones who like him. Let's just see what happens.' Juventus players celebrate after beating Monaco to reach the Champions League semi-finals . The 21-year-old, who has scored 13 goals this term, is rated at £35million by his club - a fee that the Old Lady would not be prepared to meet, leading Marotta to also express his interest in Uruguay forward Cavani. 'We've not had any contact with Paris Saint-Germain for Cavani, but if he were to be placed on the market, then we would have a little chat,' Marotta said.","Monaco loanee Radamel Falcao is not expected to stay at Man Utd .

"The father of the little girl who starred in a photograph that sent the internet into a frenzy because of a mystery pair of boots has 'no idea' what the object could be. Martin Springall, 38, photographed his young daughter - who he wished not be named - standing near a rocky outcrop in Zushi, Japan, in July 2014. He said he was living and working in Tokyo, around an hour north, and wanted to send a picture 'to my wife, who was at work'. 'I took a series of them,' Mr Springall said via email. 'It wasn't until I was checking them later in the evening that I just happened to notice the boots behind her in that one shot.' 'I showed my wife immediately. She was considerably more upset by it than I was, to be honest. Martin Springall (pictured with his daughter, who he wished not to be named) said he had 'no idea' what the item could be . A trick of the light or paranormal forces at play? There is chatter online about what the cause of this apparent black boot apparition is . Eerie: A pair of black boots are clearly seen behind the little girl - even though her photographer father apparently does not recall a person standing there . The Reddit user who posted the controversial image online suggested they could be samurai boots - although others are not so sure . Mr Springall gave permission for his friend, Brian, to post the image to Reddit - where it became a topic of 'mostly negative' discussion - until it resurfaced this week . 'I just kind of obsessed over that one photo for a couple of hours that evening and then tried to forget about it. 'I really don't like dwelling on stuff like this, to be honest - it freaks me out.' The photograph has sparked considerable debate on the website Reddit, with sceptics arguing whether the picture was modified, if there was a person standing behind the girl or if it was all a trick of the light. Mr Springall insisted there was 'no one' else in the vicinity - and said it had not been Photoshopped, despite sceptics believing otherwise. 'I certainly would have noticed someone standing behind her in one of the shots,' he said. 'She likely wouldn't even have posed for the picture in that case, because she's incredibly shy'. In this picture from the same set, no one appears to be standing behind this little girl . However, in this other supplied picture, the black boots have returned . 'I have no idea what the boots are, where they come from or what they could represent. 'All I can tell you is that I totally get the cynicism.... If I saw that online I would view it exactly the same way. 'I can assure you, though, that it was just the two of us in the area and the photo is 100% untouched. He said he showed his friend Brian Publicover, 38, the picture on a camping trip around a month later. Mr Publicover, a Canadian, then posted it to Reddit under the username Obiaruf. 'We're not saying it's a ghost,' said Mr Publicover, who is working in Japan, where his friend was also living until a few months ago. Friends: Brian (left) posted the picture to Reddit, where it took off. Both Martin and Brian . Sceptics have noted the presence of a blue piece of fabric lingering behind the little girl . He added that he had just been 'speculating' previously when he said on Reddit that the boots appeared to be 'samurai boots'. He said there were more convincing posts on Reddit that argued it was actually the image of an American World War II era uniform. Particularly given a flash of blue fabric that appeared above her left arm. 'I hope someone can put this through some sort of image-analysis software,' he said. 'We aren't trying to pull some sort of scam here. We're just saying ""we can't explain this, and it's a bit unsettling"".' Mr Springall, who lives in Toronto with his wife and child, has an open mind. 'I'm about as skeptical as they come when it comes to the paranormal, so your guess is as good as mine.'","Photograph showed mysterious pair of boots behind little girl .

"Never mind John Prescott's 'Two Jags'. Thrifty motorists whose budgets won't stretch to the favourite luxury car of the Labour peer might consider 'two dragons' instead. For Korea's SsangYong is launching a new sports utility vehicle from under £13,000 that promises value for money motoring for drivers who believe in watching their pennies. But SsangYong (Korean for 'two dragons') has given its new sporty five-door family runaround a very European name - Tivoli - after the stylish Italian town near Rome, home to the Villa d'Este, a Unesco world heritage site famed for its Renaissance architecture and garden. SsangYong (Korean for 'two dragons') is launching a value for money sports utility vehicle . Pitched to take on the pumpedup Nissan Juke, the Tivoli SUV is powered by 1.6 litre Euro 6 petrol and diesel engines with six speed manual and automatic transmissions. It arrives in the UK this summer in three trim levels - SE, EX, ELX - with a choice of front-wheel drive or 'intelligent' 4x4 and seven airbags across the range. There's also a five-year unlimited mileage warranty. The entry level SE, from £12,950, is finished in grey cloth trim and includes 16-in alloys, cruise control, a petrol stop/go system, seven airbags and 'smart' steering with normal, comfort and sport modes. The top-of-the-range ELX, from £16,000 to £19,000, comes fully loaded with a choice of the full range of engines and gearboxes plus diamond cut alloy wheels, smart keyless starting, front and rear parking sensors, privacy glass, rear spoiler, automatic headlamps, rain sensing wipers, TomTom navigation system with 7 in touch screen and a rear-view camera. There is a choice of six exterior colours, and even a 'My Tivoli' personalisation programme which allows customers to create their own distinctive car. This includes the styling pack (£400) which gives a choice of five two-tone roof combinations, plus further engine and drivetrain options. As well as offering lots of interior seating and storage space, it aims to offer driver and passengers easy connectivity to their IT devices. SssangYong's UK sales and marketing director Steve Gray expects it to double the firm's annual UK sales from 2,000 to 4,000 a year. UK chief executive Paul Williams says: 'This is a car that will really put SsangYong on the map and change perceptions.' Citroen's Aircross model (above) has protective alloy bumps front and side . Motorists of a certain age may recall those fondly remembered TV adverts from childhood for rufty-tufty Tonka Toys. These were virtually indestructible metal cars - usually 4x4s or trucks with massive wheels. The TV advert informed viewers: 'They build real tough toys, for real tough boys - Tonka!' Well, Citroen seems to have taken its inspiration from them for its Aircross model (above). It even has protective alloy bumps front and side made from honeycomb aluminium castings surrounded by hard rubber. Billed as a big brother to the current Citroen C4 Cactus, it was shown in prototype hybrid form at the Shanghai Motor Show in China. Citroen's global boss, Briton Linda Jackson, says her company has to regain the sort of design flair that created the 2CV: 'If we want stand-out cars, then we have to be bold.' The prototype has a 1.6 litre petrol engine linked to an electric motor combining to create 313bhp. Citroen claims a special boost function will help it accelerate from rest to 62mph in 4.5 seconds. Don't hold your breath. But many do see it as France's answer to Britain's new Land Rover Discovery Sport. Ii is almost time for the next Goodwood Festival of Speed. Tickets have now gone on sale for the event which runs from June 25 to 28. The theme of 'Flat-Out and Fearless: Racing on the Edge' pays tribute to the drivers and constructors throughout history who 'threw caution to the wind in pursuit of victory'. Goodwood favourites: JackieStewart and his wife Helen . The festival, billed as 'the world's largest automotive garden party' is held in the grounds of Lord March's Goodwood House and estate near Chichester, West Sussex. It attracts the A-list of the world motor manufacturing chiefs, motor sport legends - from Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton to Sir Stirling Moss and Sir Jackie Stewart - as well as showbiz celebrities in a way the original British Motor Show never could. More than 600 cars and motorcycles spanning the phenomenal history of motoring and motor sport take part alongside a 'Moving Motor Show' presented by the AA. The traditional central feature - a vast automotive-themed sculpture - will this year honour Japanese car giant Mazda's contribution to motoring and motor sport in the year that the latest incarnation of its best-selling MX-5 sports car is launched. Details and tickets: goodwood.com. Race and road car designer Professor Gordon Murray - who produced the legendary McLaren F1 supercar - is to collaborate with engine specialist Osamu Goto to create an ultracompact fuel-efficient vehicle for city use. But it has to run on conventional fuels such as petrol. The car, being sponsored by Shell under the code-name 'Project M' is to be unveiled in November.","SsangYong (Korean for 'two dragons') is launching a  sports utility vehicle .

"Lorenzo Simon was today found guilty of murder after killing his tenant then hacking his body into pieces . A landlord who chopped his friend up and stuffed the body parts into suitcases which he dumped in a canal was today found guilty of murder. Lorenzo Simon, 34, forced victim Michael Spalding, 39, to decorate his flat before attacking him when he refused to work any longer. He then dismembered the handyman using a hacksaw and put Mr Spalding's body parts and tools into two suitcases. Simon, with the help of his girlfriend Michelle Bird, 35, then threw the suitcases into a canal which they weighed down using broken concrete slabs. Today he was found guilty of murder after a jury took 15 hours to decide by unanimous verdict at Birmingham Crown Court. Bird was cleared of murder and manslaughter but admitted assisting an offender following the four-week trial. The court heard Simon murdered Mr Spalding, known as Spud, by stabbing him in the neck at the flat they shared in Smethwick, Birmingham, on April 26 last year. He then hacked the body up and stuffed the head, limbs and tools into a suitcase. Police found his remains when a narrow boat owner spotted one suitcase, containing Mr Spalding's torso, floating in the Birmingham Canal on May 5. It was examined by a Canal Trust contractor on May 12, who opened the case to discover the gruesome evidence. Police divers recovered the second case which contained Mr Spalding's head, limbs and tools - below Pope Bridge, Smethwick, on May 16. Further searches of the canal bed uncovered a hacksaw which was used to saw off Mr Spalding's head. Using futuristic 3D scanning technology experts were able to show a perfect jigsaw fit between the charred bone and a severed limb found in the suitcase. The same technique - which provides image resolution 43,000 times more detailed that a hospital CT scan - proved a link between the hacksaw and lacerations found on other bones. Mr Spalding's body parts were found inside this suitcase, which was dumped in the Birmingham Canal . A second suitcase (pictured) containing Mr Spalding's grisly remains was discovered 11 days later . Drag marks were also found on the towpath near Pope's Bridge where Simon and Bird dumped the suitcases into the canal. Unemployed Simon, who has convictions for robbery, burglary, theft and supplying drugs, moved to Derby in a bid to evade police but was arrested with Bird on May 19. He denied knowledge of Mr Spalding's death, claiming he threw him out following a row over a car crash, but later admitted assaulting him during a fight. Neighbours reported seeing a bonfire in the garden and when officers raided the home they discovered part of a humerus bone inside the drum. Detectives later heard accounts from neighbours who told of 'aggressive, nasty' arguments coming from the flat. One recalled Simon saying: 'I want this place finished, I've got to live here, you are taking the p**s'. 3D scanning technology was able to prove a link between this hacksaw and lacerations found on Mr Spalding's bones . Mr Spalding was heard to reply: 'I'm tired, I'm hungry, I want to go home. I've been at it all day'. Adjourning the case until next Wednesday for sentencing, Justice Kathryn Thirlwall said: 'Lorenzo Simon you have been convicted of murder. As you know the sentence for murder is life imprisonment. 'The question is the minimum amount of time you should serve before the consideration of parole.' Speaking after the verdict, Detective Inspector Harry Harrison, of West Midlands Police, said: 'Michael was exploited in life by Lorenzo Simon and Michelle Bird and they afforded him no dignity in death. When police raided the home, parts of a humerus bone were discovered inside this charred drum . 'On the contrary, they treated him in the most despicable manner in order to conceal their crime. 'Simon accepted Michael as a tenant on the agreement he used his considerable handyman skills to do up the flat. 'But he treated him like a slave, working him past midnight and then waking him early in the morning to continue working. 'They were only allowed out with his say-so and given just one meal a day, usually pizza and chips. 'Michael finally broke and complained at their treatment. We believe that, combined with a car accident where Simon accused him of being responsible for damaging his VW Passat, led to the fatal attack. 'Simon said he hit Michael in the back and that he fell to the floor dead within seconds and claimed to have disposed of the body in panic. 'Bird said she was on an errand to buy alcohol at the time of the killing but later admitted helping her boyfriend in the aftermath. 'However, we were able to provide compelling evidence to the jury that this was a vicious murder and that Simon went to considerable lengths to try and cover his tracks.'","Lorenzo Simon, 34, forced tenant Michael Spalding to decorate his flat .

"Ten people, including four children, have been involved in a multi-vehicle crash in Brisbane's west. Three vehicles collided on the Brisbane Valley Highway, 2km south of Fernvale, on Wednesday afternoon. A 40-year-old man with chest and shoulder injuries and a five-year-old boy with chest pain were the first patients flown out by rescue helicopter. They've been taken to the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Brisbane. Shortly after, a 27-year-old woman with arm injuries and a six-year-old girl suffering from abdominal pain were also being flown out. The three car pileup happened at on the Brisbane Valley Highway, near Fernvale . Six others - including an infant and two young girls - have been taken to Ipswich Hospital with minor injuries or for further assessment. A man has also suffered hand lacerations and two females escaped injuries. The affected stretch of the highway has been closed off, with diversions in place south of Fernvale. The Courier-Mail reports that earlier emergency crews found one person trapped inside their vehicle and Queensland Fire and Rescue crews used hydraulic cutting gear to free them. The Rescue 500 helicopter then landed at the scene and airlifted a number of patients to hospital. Police said the highway would be closed for a few hours with diversions in place south of Fernvale.","Three vehicles collided on the Brisbane Valley Highway, near Fernvale .

"Researchers have discovered that the brain can remember 'neutral' or boring events more easily when they are tied to an emotion . From what we eat to what we see, we constantly take in details about our environment. And while there is no need to remember many of them, our brain has the remarkable ability to store information that seems inconsequential at the time in case it becomes useful later on. Given new and relevant information, human beings have the capacity to strengthen weak memories using emotions - and researchers have said this points to the adaptive nature of human memory. Psychologists at New York University have been trying to gain an understanding about how the brain stores memories for 'emotionally neutral events' that gain significance through subsequent experience. 'How does the brain store all of this information? And how does emotion strengthen mundane memories?' post-doctoral fellows Joseph Dunsmoor and Vishnu Murty wrote on The Conversation. This study largely focused on how our brains remember emotionally arousing stimuli, such as evocative imagery or traumatic events . In particular, the study has looked into how the September 11 terrorist attacks in the the US affect memory retention. The researchers said we take for granted that we remember highly emotional events better than we remember neutral events, like a lunch date. Emotion increases our ability to remember by affecting activity in brain regions involved in emotional processing - particularly the amygdala and striatum - and also the regions involved in encoding new experiences, like the hippocampus. Scroll down for video . Emotion also increases the strength of our memory over time - a process called consolidation. Strong emotion can strengthen memory for positive events, such as a surprise birthday party thrown by close friends, and for negative events, such as making an embarrassing faux pas at the office holiday party. Researchers said we take for granted that we remember highly emotional events, like 9/11, better than we remember neutral events, like a lunch date. This is because emotion affects activity in certain brain regions. A view over the Hudson River towards the September 11th memorial lights is shown . A power nap of just 45 minutes can boost memory by five times, research has found. A short doze helps you to retain information you have learned and 'significantly' improves recall, scientists said – meaning naps really could help students revising for exams. Participants in the study learned 90 single words and 120 unconnected word pairs such as 'milk taxi'. Some then watched a DVD while others slept. When they were then retested, those who had slept remembered more word pairs, the journal Neurobiology of Learning and Memory reported last month. Scientists from Saarland University in Germany, said that during sleep, bursts of brain activity known as sleep spindles play an important role in consolidating newly learned information. Professor Axel Mecklinger said a nap of just 45 minutes to an hour 'produces a five-fold improvement in information retrieval from memory'. 'The memory performance of the participants who had a power nap was just as good as it was before sleeping, that is, immediately after completing the learning phase.' While many details are not intrinsically emotionally arousing, they can gain emotional significance through our experiences. For example, the memory of a surprise birthday party includes details like what people were wearing and who was there. On the face of it, these details are not emotionally significant but we remember them because of the context in which they were experienced. Dr Dunsmoor and Dr Murty’s research has shown that people have better memory for boring information when it’s presented in an emotional context, regardless of if it is rewarding or negative. ‘In some of our earlier studies, we found that people selectively remember neutral pictures if the pictures had been associated with an electrical shock the previous day, even when the volunteers were unaware that we would later test their memory, they wrote. ‘We have also shown that people remember neutral pictures if they are warned that if they forget them, they will receive a shock the next day. ‘Likewise, being rewarded with money for remembering certain pictures the next day can boost memory for those pictures as well.’ These experiments focus on emotional factors at the time the original memory is created and the findings show how seemingly trivial information associated with a meaningful event can be selectively preserved in memory. Emotion also increases the strength of our memory over time - a process called consolidation. Strong emotion can strengthen memory for positive events, such as a surprise birthday party (stock image), and for negative events, such as making an embarrassing faux pas at an office party . Emotion affects activity in brain regions involved in emotional processing - such as the amygdala (pictured) and regions involved in encoding new experiences, like the hippocampus (also marked) But what happens when the emotional event happens after the original memories were formed? ‘In a recent study, we found that an emotional experience can enhance memory for neutral information encountered previously,’ the researchers continued. Volunteers viewed a series of trivial pictures from two categories, either animals or tools. After a delay, volunteers were presented with a new set of animal and tool pictures – only this time, when the volunteer saw the pictures they received an electrical shock to the wrist. ‘We already knew that memory would be strengthened for the pictures paired with the electrical shock. But here we found that if we paired shocks with pictures of animals, memory was strengthened for pictures of animals volunteers saw before any shocks were delivered. ‘If we shocked volunteers when they where shown pictures of tools, memory for the earlier pictures of tools was strengthened.’ The negative experience selectively increased memory for related information that was completely trivial when it was originally experienced. We use our memory not only to remember the past, but to guide our decisions in the future. Emotion helps us remember relevant information to determine our choices, but without the ability to strengthen seemingly trivial past experiences with new important information, we might end up missing out on future rewards or repeating the same mistakes.","New York University psychologists studied how the brain stores memories .

"Hull bounced back from Thursday's derby defeat to Hull KR to snatch a surprise 28-20 victory at Langtree Park, condemning St Helens to a third straight defeat. A long-distance Jamie Shaul try was enough to seal a win that shocked the home side, who appeared to be hanging on after their Good Friday exertions. The injury-hit champions - who were in the wars again last week, losing to rivals Wigan - started with two teenage debutants in their three-quarters, and Hull sensed that there were some seams to pick at. Fetuli Talanoa (left) celebrates scoring against St Helens as Hull recorded a shock victory . Hull took an early lead after forcing a repeat set from a fumbled high kick and then another from offside on the line. That pressure finally told when Joe Westerman and Leon Pryce combined to create the space for Shaul to slip through. Jordan Rankin added the extras to make it 6-0. A Saints penalty from a high tackle put them in a good attacking spot and from there nice work from Lance Hohaia and James Roby sent the supporting Tommy Makinson skipping through. Makinson tagged on the two to level the match. And Saints were soon back for more and this time a lovely short ball from Jordan Turner sent Louie McCarthy-Scarsbrook powering over the whitewash, with Makinson adding the goal . Tom Makinson, who brought Saints level after Shaul's early try, breaks away from two tacklers . The to-and-fro nature continued and a pair of Hull penalties gave them a great position to have another crack at the line with wing Curtis Naughton just managing to get the ball down despite tackle of Bailey to cut the deficit to 12-10 on 24 minutes. Saints very nearly hit right back with fresh-legged Alex Walmsley believing he had cashed in on a Hull dropped ball with a try, only for the in-goal touch judge to rule a knock on in the build up. Saints made a tactical switch at the break, with youngster Bailey withdrawn and the backline reshuffled. Hull hit the front eight minutes into the second half when former Saint Leon Pryce made a telling intervention, attacking the line and getting the ball down despite the tackle. Rankin's goal made it 16-12 to the visitors. Saints almost hit back immediately with a great break by Roby carving open the Hull defence, but although that play was foiled on the line they were soon back for more. Joe Westerman and Mark Minichiello stop Andre Savelio as Hull recorded a vital win at St Helens . And from a penalty on 54 minutes Turner, playing against his former club, showed some determination in driving towards the posts. Makinson improved to put Saints 18-16 ahead. Saints did suffer a stroke of bad luck when Adam Swift pieced the Hull left flank and was looking dangerous but then lost the ball. Hull forced an error when Hohaia was adjudged to have knocked on a high Pryce kick. From there the visitors piled on the pressure and that finally told when a floated wide ball sent Fetuli Talanoa over on 66 minutes. Rankin missed the goal but Hull had a two-point lead and looked determined to defend it. The visitors' defence holds firm to stop Josh Jones breaking through as Jordan Rankin brings him down . A penalty from a high tackle allowed Makinson to level from 30 metres nine minutes from time, but the Saints were hanging on. After a high kick was caught and returned quickly by Swift, Saints were soon back on the front foot, but a fumble by Ashworth on the halfway line turned the ball over. Hull countered ruthlessly with Shaul showing a great turn of pace and nimble footwork to turn Makinson inside out to run in from halfway. Rankin goaled and to compound Saints' misery the restart kick went out on the full. Hull worked their way down field with Rankin slotting another penalty to make the game safe with three minutes to play.","Weakened St Helens suffer another defeat against strong Hull side .

"A gang of six men have been jailed for a total of 31 years after being convicted of a string of sexual offences against teenager girls. The offences, which ranged from inciting sexual activity with a child, to rape, happened in cars, woods or at the defendants' homes in Banbury, Oxfordshire. Oxford Crown Court heard how they lured victims to parties organised on social media and then began sexually abusing them. The men were found guilty in March and have now been handed sentences of between three and nine years in jail. Jailed: Ahmed Hassan-Sule, 21 (left) was sentenced to nine years' imprisonment. Mohamed Saleh, 22, (right) was imprisoned for four years and nine months . The girls, aged between 13 and 16, were targeted by the gang  at under-18s parties organised by Ahmed Hassan-Sule, 21, known as 'Fiddy'. One child described the parties as 'a place where girls would go and the boys would choose their targets'. The victims, who were described in court as 'emotionally immature' were abused from 2009 to 2014. Sentencing Hassan-Sule and the others in a court packed with friends and relatives of the defendants and victims yesterday, Judge Zoe Smith said: 'You put on charity events to raise money for your football club. 'This raised your profile among young people in Banbury and you saw yourself as a celebrity. 'Your friends helped put on these events and you became a sexually promiscuous group, not with your own girlfriends, but with girls who were young, vulnerable and lacking in maturity.' The judge rejected the argument put forward by the defence, who accused the girls of coming forward because 'it's better to be a victim than a slag'. Behind bars: Kagiso Manase, 26, (left) was jailed for four years and Said Saleh, 20, (right) was sentenced to four years' detention in a Young Offenders Institute . One of the victims told the Oxford Mail: 'When I used to go missing I would swear at my mum and I didn't realise I was being really nasty to her. The men put me against my family – it was really clever. When I started hanging around with them I felt important. 'I had no friends and they were the only people left to talk to. It was a big part of my life and I was scared. I felt like all my friends were making new memories and I wasn't part of them. 'Calling people ""slags"" as the defence did in this case stops other girls from coming forward. I would say to other girls to think about the future. I never wanted to do it. I never wanted to have sex with them but I thought that's what friends did.' Thames Valley Police launched Operation Reportage after receiving a tip-off about the men's activities and eventually tracked down numerous teenager girls who had been molested. Detective Inspector Steve Raffield from Banbury Force CID said: 'This result would not have been possible without the bravery of the victims.

"Two mistakes from Rangers keeper Robby McCrorie handed Celtic the Glasgow Cup as they clinched the trophy for the fourth time in eight seasons at Hampden. Josh Kerr took advantage when the Scotland under-17 star came for a corner and missed it to put the Hoops in front before McCrorie dropped a Mark Hill free kick over the line. With Old Firm bosses Ronny Deila and Stuart McCall looking on, it was the former who left happiest after seeing Tommy McIntyre’s side record a deserved victory.

Both teams line up ahead of the match which was played behind closed doors at Hampden Park . And as only local schoolkids and their parents were allowed in following trouble among fans at the last three finals, the match passed without any major off-field problems. Rangers took the game to their opponents but early headers from Aiden Wilson and Ross McCrorie ran past either post. Celtic hit back and began to dictate play, sitting further up the park the more time wore on and pressing well for an opener. Nine days after the Parkhead club’s first team was denied a clear penalty in the Scottish Cup against Inverness, their youths had another good claim. But Kyle Bradley’s handball in the box from a Regan Hendry shot went unnoticed by referee Stephen Graham before the midfielder fired the rebound straight at Robby McCrorie. Calvin Miller then shot just over from 20 yards, Hendry was denied again by McCrorie and Miller screwed another long-range drive inches wide as the Hoops looked more likely to net. Kerr fires the ball into the net to give Celtic the lead against Rangers in the 74th minute . Kerr slides along the Hampden pitch in celebration after putting Celtic ahead . Mark Hill (third left) is congratulated by his team-mates after doubling Celtic's lead . Just when it seemed they would get themselves in front, Hendry nodded past from close range when Miller picked him out with a great right-wing cross and it was a poor miss. Rangers were being restricted to playing on the counter and offered little in attack, with a low Ross Lyon shot that ran tamely wide being as close as they came. It took some strong defending to keep them level at the break too, with two last-gasp tackles from Wilson and Ross McCrorie being just enough to deny Hendry. Celtic kept pressing after the restart, with Theo Archibald firing a volley over and Rory Currie’s low attempt flashing off target. They almost paid for their slackness in front of goal, with Gers’ Sam Jamieson forcing a terrific tip over the bar from keeper Ross Doohan.

The Light Blues took heart from that and began coming forward more but were just as sloppy with their finishing as Wilson nodded a Lyon corner over. Celtic responded once again, with Robby McCrorie smothering Mark Hill’s attempt, Dan Higgins aiming too high from 20 yards and McCrorie gathering Archibald’s grasscutter. Rangers made their best chances through Lyon and substitute Jamie Barjonas but rued their misses as Celtic scored twice in as many minutes and McCrorie was culpable both times.

He failed to take Hendry’s corner when he tried to claim it with 16 minutes left and Kerr lashed in the loose ball from four yards. McCrorie’s error moments later was worse, however, as he fumbled into the net when a flighted Hill free kick came in from wide on the left. Rangers tried to get back into the game and Jamieson came closest but Doohan kept him out and that sealed Celts’ success.","Celtic U17 won the Glasgow Cup at Hampden Park on Tuesday night .

"A monkey that was thought to have died out more than 50 years ago has been discovered alive in the remote rain forests of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Primatologists working in Ntokou-Pikounda National Park have captured the first ever picture of the Bouvier's red colobus monkey. Their discovery proves that the primate - which was first discovered in 1887 and is only known from three specimens - is not extinct. Scroll down for video . This is the first ever photograph of the Bouvier's red colobus monkey, which was thought to have been extinct . The image captured by researchers Lieven Devreese and Gaël Elie Gnondo Gobolo appears to show a mother with her young. Researchers now hope to study the monkey in an attempt to learn more about it. A new species of monkey has been discovered after scientists learned to distinguish it by the appearance of its penis. The white-cheeked macaque was discovered in the remote highland forests of south-east Tibet after researchers set up camera traps. The monkey has a distinctive rounded penis rather than the arrow shaped genitalia found on other species in the area. Officially named Macaca leucogenys, it earned its common name due to the pale whiskers on its chin and the side of its face. Dr Pengfei Fan, one of the researchers who discovered the new species and a biologist at Dali University, Yunnan, in China, said the new macaque had long been misidentified as another species. He said that due to the remoteness of the location in Medog County of Tibet, few biologists had been there. Mr Devreese said: 'Our photos are the world's first and confirm that the species is not extinct. 'No one knows anything about them. They live in an area where scientists rarely go, along the banks of a river a in a very inaccessible area.' Mr Devreese spent three months, after setting off in February, searching the jungles of Congo in an attempt to find the Bouvier red colobus monkeys, or Piliocolobus bouvieri. Together with his Congelese colleagues, he visited remote villages to ask locals if they had seen them and traced the locations of unconfirmed reports of sightings. A group of the monkeys were discovered living in the forests that sit along the Bokiba River in the Ntokou-Pikounda National Park. However, they found that the creatures appear to be extremely vulnerable to hunters involved in the commercial bushmeat trade in the area. Red colobus monkeys are among the largest primates in the forests of Congo and are prized by hunters. The animals are also poor at recognising threats, often believing they are safe in the trees. Rather than fleeing, red colobus monkeys tend to look down at humans from the trees. The last unconfirmed sighting of a Bouvier's red colobus monkey was in the 1970s and they are mentioned in a book from 1949 as living in swamp forests aong the Likouala and Sangha rivers. In his attempt to rediscover the monkeys, Mr Devreese launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise funds for the expedition on Indiegogo. A video is shown above . The Bouvier's red colobus monkey lives in stretches of jungle alongside rivers in the Congo (pictured above) The only previous examples of them had been collected more than 100 years ago. In his attempt to rediscover the monkeys, Mr Devreese launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise funds for the expedition on Indiegogo. Dr Fiona Maisels, from the Wildlife Conservation Society, said: 'We’re very pleased indeed that Lieven and Gaël were able to achieve their objective of not only confirming that Bouvier’s red colobus still exists, but also managing to get a very clear close-up picture of a mother and infant. 'Thankfully, many of these colobus monkeys live in the recently gazetted national park and are protected from threats such as logging, agriculture, and roads, all of which can lead to increased hunting.' James Deutsch, vice president for conservation strategy at the WCS, added: 'Confirmation that Bouvier’s red colobus still thrives in the this area reminds us that there remain substantially intact wild places on Earth, and should re-energize all of us to save them before it is too late.'","Bouvier's red colobus monkeys was last sighted in the Congo during 1970s .

"(CNN)There's an old saying which states the Cape Verde Islands are home to a greater number of musicians per square kilometer than any other country in the world. In truth, such a definitive claim may be nigh on impossible to prove. But there is a certain factual accuracy behind the legend: the important and proud relationship the Atlantic island country of just 500,000 people has with music. Situated roughly 350 miles off the west coast of Africa, Cape Verde has long been a mesh of cultures, history and races. The former Portuguese territory was once a key location for the transatlantic slave trade, a target for 16th century pirates and a refuge for exiled Jews. From this diverse melting pot were born the unique sounds of the batuque, morna, funana and other distinct musical styles. Now, Cape Verde is seeking to tap-into the spoils of this rich cultural heritage in a bid to help its economy flourish. Bereft of oil, gas, gold, diamonds or the conventional natural resources that have fueled growth in many other African countries, Cape Verde has had to look for alternative sectors to aid its development. And what's more alternative than a jiving, swinging, musical economy? ""Besides fish, it is pretty common (for Cape Verde) to say 'our biggest richness is in music and culture,'"" said Christine Semba of Womex, an international networking platform for the world music genre. The economic potential of music has been also acknowledged  by Cape Verde's prime minister, Jose Maria Neves, while the country's ministry of culture is run by Mario Lucio de Sousa, himself a popular musician. ""The future of our country lies in our capacity to create, our capacity to innovate,"" Neves said in reference to the music and the arts at a World Trade Organization conference in 2013. Other elements of the creative economy include handicrafts, fashion and visual arts to name but a few. However, a 2013 report from the UN Conference on Trade and Development noted that Cape Verde's creative sector remained a relatively small part of its economy with much room for improvement and long term planning. But that doesn't mean there hasn't been some promising early signs that music has the potential to play a key role in the future. One early musical success has been the Kriol Jazz Festival. The event, which is celebrating its seventh edition, took place in the capital city of Praia this past weekend. Artists including Grammy-winning U.S. singer Esperanza Spalding have been invited to perform, as have acts from the likes of Luxembourg, Brazil and, of course, Cape Verde. According to Harold Taveres, a liaison to the mayor of Praia involved with promoting the festival, ""KJF has become one of the most spectacular events in Cape Verde. ""We breathe the music in Cape Verde, we live with the music,"" he added. ""Now the festival has brought people from every corner in the world (to share in this)."" During the festival, bars, hotels and restaurants are full to the brim while taxi drivers are seldom unable to find a fare during what locals refer to as ""the week of party."" It's a lucrative trade, for sure. Yet in order to take full advantage of this bustling scene the country's ministry of culture, alongside some enterprising private sector figures, thought a deeper relationship with the music business was required. Enter the Atlantic Music Expo, a three-year-old conference and networking event that seeks to help Cape Verdean artists secure international exposure. This year's AME took place in the days before the Kriol Jazz Festival. Delegates, local musicians and their management teams were exposed to roundtables, workshops and talks on the intricacies of the global music business. ""We try to invite lots of producers and a lot of journalists from around the world to see the festival and the musicians from Cape Verde,"" said Jose Da Silva, long time manager of the late Cape Verdean songstress Cesaria Evora. Da Silva is one of the driving forces behind AME as well as being the founder of the Lusafrica and Harmonia record labels that aim to discover a new generation of artists from Cape Verde. He hopes that by exposing musicians to a range of experienced industry professionals and top-level musicians, they will become equipped with the tools and ambition to take the music of Cape Verde across the globe. Not only will this help launch the careers of artists and musicians (with all the respective behind the scenes business structures such developments require) but it will garner valuable attention for the country. This is where the greatest potential economic benefits lie. Tourism is expected to account for 20% of the country's GDP by 2024, according to research from the World Travel and Tourism Council. Getting Cape Verde's name out on the world stage through recognition of its rich musical culture is therefore increasingly important. ""Economically it's beneficial for the country because the money we would have to spend on the market to give the country this exposure in the world would be too big,"" Da Silva said. ""This way it costs less money."" Semba agrees with this, and highlights the joined up thinking of the government and private sector actors like Da Silva for special praise. ""In the long term, the whole country is behind this event,"" Semba said, adding ""this is a very innovative approach which we would like to see in many more countries."" It must be noted, however, that few countries have the same natural resources for music as Cape Verde. More from Marketplace Africa .","Cape Verde seeking to tap-into rich cultural heritage .

"Foreign workers will have to pay an average of £22,000 in tax before they can claim benefits under Tory plans to be unveiled this week. Migrants arriving in the UK will be banned from receiving handouts from the welfare state for four years, forcing them to pay tax and national insurance the state. Home Secretary Theresa May said the Tory manifesto will spell out plans to negotiate a new deal with Europe, including curbing access to benefits. Home Secretary Theresa May said the Tory manifesto will spell out plans to negotiate a new deal with Europe, including curbing access to benefits . Under the proposals, unemployed EU migrants in Britain will be banned from receiving state support, and would be deported if they do not get a job within six months of arriving. For those in work, they would be barred from claiming handouts like housing benefit or tax credits until they have being in the UK for four years. It means a migrant workers on an average wage will pay £22,600 in tax and national insurance over four years before they are able to receive state support. There will also be a ban on 'exporting' child benefit for children living in other EU countries. The crackdown was ordered after the government failed to meet David Cameron's target of cutting net migration to the tens of thousands. Latest figures show that in the year to September, 298,000 more people arrived in the UK than left. Mr Cameron rowed back from plans to limit freedom of movement across the EU after a backlash from German Chancellor Angela Merkel. But Mrs May today said the benefits changes would act to limit the appeal of coming to Britain from poorer parts of the EU. 'Our plan would remove a huge financial incentive for European migrants to come to Britain for the wrong reasons,' she told The Sun. 'Instead of claiming in-work benefits, under our plans the vast majority will pay into the system, contributing thousands of pounds.' Net long-term migration to the UK was estimated to be 298,000 in the year ending September 2014, a major rise on the 210,000 figure a year earlier . She said the Tories had made the immigration system 'fairer and more effective' than it was in 2010, but more was needed. The Home Secretary said: 'That's why our manifesto, which will be published this week, will spell out our plan to negotiate a new deal with Europe. 'The changes to welfare to cut EU migration will be a key part of our renegotiation with the EU, and we will put our reform package to the British people in a straight in-out referendum by the end of 2017. 'Labour oppose this plan, as they have opposed all the steps we have taken to create a fairer immigration system since 2010. Ukip talk a lot about immigration - but they don't have a serious plan for action.' Under the plans, migrants with jobs will only receive in-work benefits, such as tax credits, and social housing once they have been in the UK for four years. And no child benefits or tax credits for children living elsewhere in Europe will be paid out, regardless of how long an EU migrant has paid into UK coffers under the plans. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said immigration was important for Britain but it needed to be 'controlled and managed'. Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said immigration was important for Britain but it needed to be 'controlled and managed' She told Sky News' Murnaghan programme: 'The practical policies are that we want to make sure we have stronger border controls and that means having 1,000 more border staff to actually do proper checks to follow up on visas.' Labour, she added, would change the benefit rules so that people coming to Britain could not claim benefits until they had been in the country for more than two years. She said: 'It's not happening, what have they done in the last five years, they haven't dealt with it. And the thing that is different about our approach compared to any other party is we would deal with the exploitation by agencies, recruitment agencies and employers, who are exploiting immigration to undercut wages and jobs, that makes the system unfair. 'You've got some recruitment agencies who are recruiting from abroad, we would change the law, make exploitation a crime.' The Conservatives, she added, should not be trying to restrict overseas university students at the same time as 'doing nothing' about illegal immigration.","Conservatives will ban in-work benefits for migrants for four years .

"Tony Pulis has discussed pre-season plans with Saido Berahino in an indication he plans to keep the striker beyond the summer transfer window. Berahino is likely to be away with Gareth Southgate’s England under 21 side in the Czech Republic until late June so Pulis has begun his preparations early. West Bromwich Albion were open to bids of £20million for Berahino in January and the 21-year-old has said he would leave to fulfil his desire to play in Champions League football. West Brom manager Tony Pulis has talked pre-season plans with Saido Berahino in an indication the England under 21 striker will remain at The Hawthorns beyond the summer . Berahino has been linked with a move away from West Brom after saying he wants to play European football . Pulis said: ‘Hopefully he's away with the under 21s so I have had a chat with him about pre-season and the time he'll have off but I haven't spoken about anything else to him. ‘I think the kid is happy here, he has played that way and certainly worked that way. We're more than happy to have him here because he has been very good.’ Berahino shares the same agent as Raheem Sterling, Aidy Ward, who was criticised by Brendan Rodgers over the Liverpool player’s contract stand-off. Pulis said: ‘Agents can have a massive influence on players in lots of respects. My argument to that is in the same in life, you get good agents and you get bad agents. Berahino is likely to be included in the England under 21 squad for this summer's European Championships . Berahino scored a vital goal in England's under 21 play-off with Croatia back in October . 'Professional footballers have been given a gift and they have a lifespan of about 10-12 years. We should never forget that. To be the best is what they should be aiming for. ‘If I had an agent I'd just say, 'Look after the money, make sure when I finish this job I have enough to look after my family'. I wouldn't be talking to my agent about football.’ Pulis added: ‘I can’t speak for Sterling and I can't speak for the agent as I haven't dealt with that but the one thing I have said about Saido, he has been fantastic here. ‘There's been a real change in his attitude, his commitment to everything we've tried to do has been brilliant.’","Pulis has spoken with his striker about pre-season plans .

"A young Star Wars fan, who wrote a heartwarming note to the movies’ creator George Lucas asking whether he would allow Jedi Knights to marry in the future, was elated to receive a reply granting his request. Seven-year-old Colin Gilpatric, an aspiring Jedi Knight, was devastated to learn that achieving his dream might mean never being able to marry, as forming emotional attachments is said by the rules of the fictional order to lead Jedis to the 'dark side'. Desperate for a solution, Colin, who has autism, went directly to the man in charge: Star Wars director and writer Mr Lucas. Plea by post: Seven-year-old aspiring Jedi Colin sent a letter to George Lucas asking him to change the rule that bans the Knights from marrying . As character Anakin Skywalker's marriage to Princess Amidala led him to become a villain - and lord of the malevolent Sith Order, Darth Vader - Colin wanted to avoid the same fate, and pleaded with the Star Wars creator to make a change to the rules. 'With Colin, he was obsessing about it,' Colin's mother Peggy Gilpatric told Inside Edition: 'Finally, I was like, you know what, write to George Lucas and tell him how you feel and that's all that you can do.' 'Dear George Lucas,' Colin wrote in his letter. 'I don't like that a Jedi cannot get married. I want to get married without becoming a Sith. Please change the rule. 'P.S. I want to come to Skywalker Ranch please, Love Colin.' Soon enough, a package from Lucasfilm arrived for Colin in the mail, and his mother Peggy was on hand to film him opening it up. The letter: Colin, desperate not to end up like Anakin Skywalker - aka Darth Vader - in the film series, made his case to the Star Wars creator . The big reveal: Colin's mother filmed her son's ecstatic response as he realizes the package contains a plethora of Star Wars merchandise . In the video, Colin is ecstatic to find a stash of Star Wars goodies in the bag, including books and toys, accompanied by a letter addressing his question. 'It sounds like the Force is strong with you, and you are showing great wisdom by asking your question,' it said. 'To be a Jedi is to truly know the value of friendship, of compassion, and of loyalty, and these are values important in a marriage. The Sith think inward, only of themselves. 'When you find someone that you can connect to in a selfless way, then you are on the path of the light, and the dark side will not take hold of you. With this goodness in your heart, you can be married.' The letter was signed 'Your friends at Lucasfilm'. 'The Force is strong with me!': Colin is elated to have his question answered . Quite the response: Lucasfilm sent this letter to seven-year-old Colin to ease his mind about one day being able to get married . In the video showing Colin reading the letter for the first time, the young fan is delighted to say the least, exclaiming: 'I can get married? No way!' According to Colin's mother, the obsession with Star Wars has been a godsend for her son, who, as a result of his autism, struggles to share his emotions. 'A lot of autistic kids have a hard time understand processing emotions and the entire Star Wars universe has helped us that way,'she told Inside Edition. 'It’s very black and white. There’s a dark side and good side. 'It helped open up a dialogue about it feelings and emotions. There is a conception that some autistic kids don’t have emotions, but they do. It’s just finding the right outlet for them and the right way to express it.'","Traditional Jedi rules forbid any knights from marrying because it is thought it will lead them to the ‘dark side’

Harvey Nichols, which has 12 locations around the world and previously stood against the fur industry, backtracked last year when it quietly re-introduced it. Priced between £300 and £1,500, the department store's current range includes coyote fur courtesy of Canada Goose, raccoon fur from Charlotte Simone and plenty of rabbit pelts from Vince. 'When I see people I know wearing fur, I will initiate the conversation by asking them if it's real or not. If they confirm that it's real, I express disgust,' Ashley said, . 'If they are interested, then I will tell them more about this cruel industry. I just want people to make informed decisions with their purchases. Anti-fur: 'I love animals,' Miss James, pictured, tells MailOnline. 'Having educated myself about the fur industry, it breaks my heart to think people allow such cruelty to continue by buying fur products' Boycotter: Miss James, pictured in London this week, leads a mostly vegan lifestyle and shops at fur-free stores including Liberty London, Selfridges, House of Fraser, Topshop and Oasis . 'If they know about the industry and still choose to wear fur, then that's fine - although I can't personally understand how they could do that. 'But I think a lot of people prefer to live in ignorance, and that's really frustrating.' In a statement to MailOnline, Harvey Nichols said: '[We are] committed to sustainable and responsible practice across all areas of [our] business, and ethical trading is an important part of this programme. 'We only source products from reputable brands, which includes seeking the assurance that the fur they use in products has been sourced responsibly.' However, in a recent exposé fronted by Paloma Faith, PETA went undercover on 'Origin Assured' fur farms, a label which is meant to give fur-stocking stores assurances about the animal welfare and conditions in which animals are bred and slaughtered. It found raccoons, rabbits and minks kept in filthy wire cages, sometimes alongside the rotting corpses of other animals. 'These animals were left to suffer from untreated injuries, including missing limbs,' PETA reports. 'Frightened and distressed, they often mutilate themselves and others in the cage, only to be slaughtered in the name of fashion.' Party line: In a statement, Harvey Nichols said, 'We only source products from reputable brands, which includes seeking the assurance that the fur they use in products has been sourced responsibly' Put a name to the face: Priced between £300 and £1,500, Harvey Nichols' current designer range includes fur from coyotes (left), raccoons (center) and foxes (right) When MailOnline asked reps at Harvey Nichols to clarify their position on exactly what made them change their minds on their anti-fur policy, communication ceased and they declined to make any further comment. PETA's foundation director Mimi Bekhechi points out: 'All fur is the product of a bloody, violent industry. We encourage consumers not to be deceived by Harvey Nichols' claims of selling 'humanely and ethically' obtained furs.' Before Ashley James knew anything about the industry, she admits she owned a rabbit fur coat. 'Needless to say I don't any more,' she said. 'I gave it to a Romanian charity called K-9 Angels, which use donated furs to keep rescued dogs warm in winter.' Cruelty-free: Miss James is a particular fan of designer Stella MCartney, who has been a lifelong vegetarian and refuses to even use leather in her collections. Pictured, her 2009 A/W campaign, starring an (alive) fox . Poster girls: Stars including Natalie Portman (left), Charlize Theron (center) and Jessica Chastain (right) are all vocal anti-fur campaigners . Just say no: Abbie Cornish (left), Ellen DeGeneres (center) and Sia (right) are also vegetarians who are strongly opposed to the trend . Ashley, who now leads a mostly vegan lifestyle, praises designers like Stella McCartney, another avid anti-fur protester, and shops at fur-free stores including Liberty London, Selfridges, House of Fraser, Topshop and Oasis. Harvey Nichols is not the only entity, or person, to have broken its anti-fur promise. Supermodel Naomi Campbell, who once posed for PETA’s infamous ‘I’d rather go naked than wear fur’ campaign, then went on to become the face of fur couturier Dennis Basso in 2010.

Naomi then went on to become the face of fur couturier Dennis Basso in 2010 (pictured) Lady Gaga, who also once spoke out against fur, did a very public reversal on the subject when in 2012 she declared that she ‘admired’ the beauty of animals in fashion, stating: ‘You see a carcass, I see a museum pièce de résistance.' Still, notable celebrities who strictly avoid fur include, but are not limited to; Natalie Portman, Abbie Cornish, Jessica Chastain, Sia, Charlize Theron, Pamela Anderson, Pink, Kesha, and Ellen DeGeneres. Ashley James is using her new role to try and convert shoppers. She said: 'Have a heart. Please don't support the fur industry and boycott the brands who do.'","Ashley James joined forces with PETA to star in the grisly campaign .

"Stuart Pearce believes Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini deserves more time to turnaround the club’s dwindling fortunes. City’s challenge for the title has capitulated in recent weeks and Pellegrini’s men now face a battle to even finish in the top four. A derby day thumping at the hands of rivals Manchester United only compounded their misery, but Pearce believes City should stick with the 61-year-old. Stuart Pearce believes Manuel Pellegrini should be given more time to turn Manchester City around . The look of dejection on the faces of the Manchester City players has been a familiar sign this season . Pearce told talkSPORT: ‘The club is at a stature now where they look to continually be in the Champions League and win Premier Leagues. The club will have a good look at themselves in the summer, but I’m not a big favour of turning managers over quickly. “I hope the manager stays in place. He has been around the block long enough to realise the squad needs freshening up drastically this summer.” Yaya Toure has had a largely ineffective season for current champions Manchester City this season . Toure and Fernandinho  look dejected during the Premier League defeat to Manchester United  at Old Trafford . Pearce, who spent time at the club as both a manager and a player, blamed City’s poor run of form on the fading influence of Ivorian Yaya Toure. ‘Where City have suffered historically is when Toure has either lost form or been away on African Nations tours,"" said Pearce.

"Paul Smith, having bravely lost his two challenges to Arthur Abraham in Germany, now finds himself in pole position for a third successive joust against a reigning world super-middleweight champion. Only this time the elder of Liverpool's fine family of four fighting brothers will not be boxing for a title, even though it is against a far more formidable champion. Andre Ward, still ranked by many among the top five pound-for-pound boxers in the world despite 17 months out of the ring, sees Smith as the ideal warm-up opponent, possibly before a rematch with Carl Froch. Paul Smith (right) throws a punch towards Arthur Abraham during their title fight in Berlin in February . Andre Ward (left) poses with his many title belts after defeating Edwin Rodriguez in November 2013 . Kell Brook could have had his much-craved Battle of Britain... if Eddie Hearn had not been so 'disrespectful', claims Amir Khan's dad Shah. Read more here. Virgil Hunter, California-based trainer of both Ward and Amir Khan, says: 'Smith is who we want and I'm told it's a done deal. But it won't be for Andre's belt even though it will be over the 12-round championship distance.' The WBA have ordered their two super-middle world champions – Ward 'super,' Froch 'regular' – to meet in a unification fight. Froch declared willingness if Ward returns the compliment by travelling to the UK, having won their first meeting in the US. Ward (left) lands a left jab on Carl Froch before going on to win their title bout in New Jersey in 2011 . Froch (left) stands alongside James DeGale before a television appearance in Liverpool last July . Ward said he would make the away trip but only as far as London, not to Nottingham where Froch has long desired to box on his hometown City Ground. Hunter declares: 'Andre would have gladly taken Carl straight away.' But now it appears the WBA are granting the so-called Son of God licence to shake off the ring rust where he almost always fights, in his native city across the Bay from San Francisco. Froch, meanwhile, is turning his attention to his other remaining ambition before retirement – a first appearance on the Las Vegas Strip, against the namesake son of Mexican legend Julio Cesar Chavez.

"The producers of the TV show Made In Chelsea pride themselves on featuring some of the poshest young ladies and gentleman in London. But even by their standards, Mark-Francis Vandelli is well-to-do - the privately educated son of a multimillionaire industrialist and model wouldn't have to work a day in his life if he chose not to. But if you weren't already envious of the reality star, he has now opened up his watch collection to the Evening Standard, showing off some of the 16 eye-wateringly expensive timepieces that he has been collecting since his teens. Scroll down for video . Made In Chelsea star Mark-Francis Vandelli is a keen collector of expensive watches . The 26 year old has got into the habit of buying a new watch each year, so that he will have an impressive collection by the time he reaches middle age. Many watch enthusiasts would argue that Mark-Francis has already reached that goal - he currently owns a number of pieces that are worth several thousand pounds. In a new interview with the newspaper, he revealed his favourite items and the history behind them. The include a Bulgari Bulgari Chrono 42, a Cartier Tortue Collection Privée and a Rolex yellow gold Oyster Perpetua. Mark-Francis's most expensive watch is a Cartier white gold Moonphase, which he bought from a shop on Sloane Street in Chelsea earlier this year. Mark-Francis's most expensive watch is a Cartier white gold Moonphase (left), while one of his flashiest is a  Bulgari Bulgari Chrono 42 (right) It cost £32,000 and caught his eye because it has a sun or a moon than move on rotation depending on the hour of the day. One of the flashiest watches in his collection is the Bulgari Bulgari Chrono 42, which he purchased on holiday in Italy and can be bought secondhand on the internet for £6,5000. He said of the item: 'When I was 16 my grandmother gave me the first prototype of the Bulgari Bulgari, which the Bulgari family had given her in the 1950s - I think it's one of the only ones that was actually hand engraved around the bezel.' Mark-Francis ended up buying this modern version after he fell into a river wearing his grandmother's version while out rowing at school. Mark Francis favours a Cartier Tortue Collection Privée timepiece because it is no longer made (left), while he wears a Rolex yellow gold Oyster Perpetual when out raving in East London (right) While many of his watches are hard to come by, Mark Francis favours a Cartier Tortue Collection Privée timepiece in particular because it is no longer made, meaning he would be unlikely to be caught out wearing it at the same time as another man. Similar versions can be bought on the internet for around £9,000. He told the newspaper: 'Cartier doesn't make this one any more, which I love. I did see someone else wearing it once, however -  I was at the Wolseley and it was this fat American, I was mortified.' And finally, for the man who has a watch for every occasion - the timepiece that he wears when visiting East London... a Rolex yellow gold Oyster Perpetual. Similar watches can be bought on the internet for £8,000. He said: 'You can swim in it, sleep in it, throw it around, go to a rave. This is my hardwearing, ""I'm going to Shoreditch"" watch.'","Mark-Francis Vandelli is a keen collector of expensive watches .

"New Zealand police are appealing to the public to help identify a man who robbed a Christchurch dairy wearing a 'distinctive' cartoon mask. The offender, snapped on security footage in a fluoro orange sweatshirt and oversized  mask, is described as being 'very tall'. He made off with the dairy's till and about $1500 in cash on Saturday, Stuff.co.nz reports. A man in a 'distinctive' cartoon mask demanded cash from owner's daughter on Saturday . Police were reportedly called to the Union St dairy, in east Christchurch at about 12.30pm, after receiving reports of a masked man demanding cash from the dairy owner's daughter. Christina Chen told reporters her 30-year-old daughter ran out of the shop screaming 'robber!'. The masked man threw the cash register to the ground and took off with the till drawer and up to $1,500. 'Normally they just rob cigarettes and some more things, it's not a big issue,' Chen told Stuff.co.nz. 'But this time they were scary because they wore a mask, and we don't know who it is.' Police say there were no signs of any weapons used but that the robber remained at large. They are asking anyone with information that may help to identify this person to call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or to message police online.","Police were called to a dairy in east Christchurch after reports of a robbery .

"Just last month she was unveiled as the face of Garnier Ambre Solaire No Streaks Bronzer Self Tan range and is currently busy working on her new TV projects, but there's just no stopping Michelle Keegan. The pint-sized brunette is clearly keen to prove that there's no end to her talents - by designing yet another range for Lipsy. The actress and model has given fans a sneak peak of her stunning summer range ahead of the launch on Wednesday - and you can expect stunning summer dresses embellished with lace and feminine florals. Scroll down for video . Michelle Keegan has teased fashion fans with some items from her new Lipsy range, which will be landing in store on Wednesday . Michelle, 27, who is getting set to tie the knot with fiance Mark Wright, shows off her summer tan and enviable curves in the new campaign imagery. The designer has been chanelling her passion for fashion into Lipsy ranges for several seasons now - and her success shows no sign of abating. The former Coronation Street star, whose collections have been a stellar success for the brand, has been hard at work in the design studio to bring fans exactly what they want for the warmer months. As the clothes horse shows, her new range is full of colourful print playsuits, cool crochet and lots of sophisticated lace. Michelle, 27,  shows off her summer tan and enviable curves in the new campaign imagery . Michelle says her beauty regime is fairly minimal and she simply cleanses, tones and moisturises every day and treats herself to a facial every other week to rehydrate her skin . Speaking to FEMAIL recently, Michelle revealed the regime that keeps her fit, healthy and glowing from the inside out. Sharing her top tanning tips for a flawless faux glow as she shows off her natural beauty in behind the scenes imagery, Michelle advised: 'Always exfoliate first and not just knees and elbows, all over your body. 'Next, I moisturise all over and then use Garnier Dry Body Mist all over my body, including the underside of my arms.' The star, who says her ultimate beauty secrets are simply drinking lots of water and always taking her make-up off before bed, also swears by LVL eyelash treatments. LVL, which stands for length, volume and lift, flicks, curls and straightens lashes from the roots up so they appear much longer. 'It helps make my lashes darker and more voluminous,' says Michelle of the treatment, which takes an hour and a half and lasts over two months. The designer has been chanelling her passion for fashion into Lipsy ranges for several seasons now - and her success shows no sign of abating as she unveils yet another stylish range . The star, 27, says she's always been a fan of the range and has been using it for years so when they asked her to work with them, she was 'over the moon' The star also spoke about how important looking good was to her and how she takes a 'less is more' approach to make-up. Her beauty regime is fairly minimal and she simply cleanses, tones and moisturises every day and treats herself to a facial every other week to rehydrate her skin. She swears by Simple face wipes, Origins serums and Garnier and Kiehl's moisturisers. In terms of her diet, Michelle has been using the SoulMateFood delivery service and says she will be continuing the healthy eating plan when she comes back to Manchester while filming over the next couple of weeks. Loved by Daisy Lowe and Una Foden, the alkaline food delivery service allows you to create your own healthy menus, which are delivered straight to your front door. 'It's perfect for me as I am always on the go at the moment and I can always have it with me,' she said of the meal service. When she's cooking for herself at home, Michelle starts the day with scrambled egg on brown toast with tomato, followed by a high protein banana smoothie with peanut butter. For lunch, she has a turkey or chicken salad sandwich on brown bread and dinner is salad with chicken or prawn. The flawless star, who found fame on Coronation Street, reveals that her simple but effective beauty secrets are  drinking lots of water and always taking her make-up off before bed . The actress likes to snack on fruit, nuts and her favourite treat: popcorn. Bodywise, Michelle says she tries to work out as much as possible and whilst there's 'always an excuse not to go', she ends up feeling better after a workout. 'I've been very busy at the moment but if I have time, I go to the gym 3-4 times per week.' She doesn't, however, do any cardio and simply sticks to weight training to tone up. 'Cardio is good for getting you sweating but it slims you down and I think it makes me look too skinny,' she admitted. She also swears by the 8-minute abs YouTube video, which she does when she gets home from the gym. As for the future, Michelle says she 'may consider' doing an accessories and jewellery range but for now, she's focussing on her acting duties. 'I start filming next week for new movie,' she revealed. 'I am also in talks for another film, so fingers crossed it will go well.' In between posing in beauty shoots and designing her own Lipsy range, Michelle has been filming for new projects and is in talks for a new movie .","Michelle unveils sneak peak of Lipsy designs ahead of launch on Wednesday .

"(CNN)Michele Bachmann is comparing President Obama to the co-pilot of the doomed Germanwings flight. ""With his Iran deal, Barack Obama is for the 300 million souls of the United States what Andreas Lubitz was for the 150 souls on the German Wings flight - a deranged pilot flying his entire nation into the rocks,"" the Minnesota Republican and former representative wrote in a Facebook comment posted March 31. ""After the fact, among the smoldering remains of American cities, the shocked survivors will ask, why did he do it?"" Andreas Lubitz, the co-pilot of Germanwings Flight 9525, is accused by authorities of deliberately crashing the plane in the French Alps. He died in the crash along with 149 other crew and passengers. The motive of the March 24 crash is under investigation, though investigators are looking in to whether Lubitz feared a medical condition would cause him to lose his pilot's license. Many comments posted on her Facebook page blasted the former representative. Melissa Coca wrote, ""Comparing this tragedy to anything is moronic and despicable."" Michael J Pristash wrote, ""Your allusion is so inappropriate and divisive, not to mention disrespectful on so many levels. Shame on you."" Some also accused her of taking desperate measures to stay in the public eye. Lynda Anderson wrote, ""Posting outrageous things in a pathetic attempt to stay relevant?"" Negotiations are coming down to the wire between Iran, the United States and other nations on restricting Tehran's nuclear program to prevent the ability to develop an atomic bomb. One deadline passed Tuesday, but there is a June 30 deadline for a comprehensive deal -- with all technical and diplomatic impasses fully worked out. Bachmann is no stranger to voicing her opinion on the President's dealing with Iran, personally telling him to ""bomb Iran"" during the 2014 White House Christmas Party. ""I turned to the president and I said, something to the effect of, 'Mr. President, you need to bomb the Iranian nuclear facilities, because if you don't, Iran will have a nuclear weapon on your watch and the course of world history will change,'"" she told the Washington Free Beacon.

"The widow of US Navy SEAL Chris Kyle has revealed the painful moment she first broke the news to their two children that their father had been murdered. Taya Kyle told ABC's Robin Roberts she gathered her son, Colton and daughter, McKenna and prepared to tell them. 'I remembered just closing my eyes, the tears rolling down and me just trying to breathe,' said Kyle. Reveal: Taya Kyle had to do everything she could from falling apart in front of her kids when she explained to them their father had been killed . Recovery: Taya has given an interview to 20/20s Robin Roberts about her life since Eddie Ray Routh was convicted of killing her husband, American Sniper, Chris Kyle . Taya, 40, was speaking to Roberts for a special edition of ABC News' 20/20 which will air on Friday, May 1 and will catch up with the widow of Kyle, whose story is portrayed in the blockbuster movie, American Sniper. It will be the first in-depth interview that Kyle has given since former Marine Eddie Ray Routh was found guilty of capital murder on February 24 for shooting dead Chris Kyle and his friend, Chad Littlefield. He was automatically handed a life sentence without the possibility of parole and Taya Kyle broke down in tears on the stand when she gave evidence on the first day of the trial. During the course of their interview, Kyle jokes with Roberts that she never thought she would marry 'a cowboy' but was 'excited' by falling in love with him. 'I never probably thought a cowboy would want me,' she said. 'And I said I would never marry somebody -- a SEAL either. So… 'there you go with your plans again,' right?'

Taxing and emotional testimony: Taya Kyle wipes the tears from her eyes as she gives evidence from the stand during the trial of Chris Kyle's killer, Eddie Ray Routh in February . Eddie Ray Routh pleaded not guilty to killing Chris Kyle and said that he shot him and his friend Chad Littlefield dead because he was suffering PTSD. The jury decided he was guilty of murder and knew what he was doing . Taya has also written a new book, 'American Wife: A Memoir of Love, War, Faith and Renewal' which will go into detail about her marriage and the aftermath of Chris's death. The book is released on May 4 and Taya hopes it will draw a line under her recent events. In March, Taya published a heartbreaking letter to mark their 13th wedding anniversary. Taya Kyle pledged to love her late husband 'all the days of my life' in the touching tribute in which she described the moment her future husband gave her two dozen roses during one of their first dates. Kyle, who was the subject of last year's Clint Eastwood-directed movie American Sniper, was gunned down by fellow war veteran Eddie Ray Routh at a shooting range in Rough Creek, Texas, on February 2, 2013. Taya Kyle was the first witnesses called during the trial. The judge also allowed her to attend the public gallery afterwards to watch the trial . American Sniper: Eddie Ray Routh shot Chris Kyle dead in February of 2013. In February of 2015 he was found guilty for the death of the war hero . That day, Kyle had offered to help Routh deal with his post traumatic stress disorder but was instead shot dead along with his friend Chad Littlefield. Now, in the wake of a turbulent year that involved her husband's killer's trial and an appearance at the Academy Awards for the film made in his name, Mrs Kyle has written of her enduring love for her husband. Posted on Facebook in March, her letter said: 'I feel you in my heart and soul so strongly. I am more blessed to have been your wife than anything else in my life. 'Today, I am thinking of our new relationship, when you rented a boutique hotel room in San Diego and surprised me with two dozen long stem pink roses when we arrived. You got us tickets to a local improv type play. I knew then I was the luckiest girl in the world to be with tough, romantic, loving you. 'Today, I have a choice. I can bury myself under the covers and acknowledge the pain of missing you and mourn the future anniversaries without you. Or, I can celebrate never having a day without you in my heart because you loved me enough to leave me a lifetime of memories and beauty. 'I am somewhere in between today. I loved you yesterday, I love you know, and I will love you all the days of my life.' Kyle was considered the deadliest sniper in American history, with his kill count thought to number about 160 confirmed, with many more probable kills.","Taya Kyle, 40 remembers crying as she told her young son and daughter .

"Rome (CNN)The Italian navy has boarded and retaken control of a fishing boat that had been seized hours earlier by gunmen off the coast of Sicily, the Italian military said Friday. The boat, named Airone, was intercepted some 90 kilometers (56 miles) from the Libyan port of Misrata, according to a statement from the Italian Joint Forces. An Italian naval unit boarded the fishing boat and took custody of a Libyan soldier on the vessel, according to a statement by the Italian Navy. It said during the operation, rifle shots were accidentally fired, and one of the seven fisherman on board was slightly injured. The Airone, carrying three Sicilians and four Tunisians, had embarked from Mazara del Vallo in Sicily five days earlier to fish for shrimp. The Airone's captain said there were about 10 other ships in the area when it was seized, according to Vito Mazzarino, the boat's owner. ""At a certain point a tug boat came up and flanked the fish boat and some Libyans came on board,"" Mazzarino said, quoting the captain, Alberto Figuccia. ""They were armed. And at that point chaos erupted."" Italy is a major gateway to Europe for migrants from North Africa. Thousands of people each year make the dangerous sea journey from North Africa to Europe's Mediterranean coast, to flee war and poverty. Italy registered more than 10,000 migrants in the first three months of 2015, according to the International Organization for migration. On Monday, gunmen on a speedboat fired shots in the air and sped away with a wooden boat that was being used to transport migrants, according to Frontex, the European Union's border management agency. That incident occurred 60 nautical miles from the Libyan coast. The 250 migrants on board had already been transferred on to a different boat, Frontex said on its website. ""This is a sign that smugglers in Libya are running short of boats and are more willing to use weapons to recover those used to transport the migrants,"" said Fabrice Leggeri, Frontex's executive director, in a news release.

"A virulent strain of bird flu continues to hammer the Midwest and the virus recently took its biggest toll yet after it hit a farm in Iowa that held nearly 10 percent of the state's egg-laying chickens. Poultry producers and scientists had been hoping warmer weather would knock down the deadly bird flu virus. But the U.S. Department of Agriculture said Monday that the H5N2 bird flu virus had been found at a farm in northwest Iowa's Osceola County - prompting a massive bird cull. Bird flu: Chickens stand in their cages at a farm near Stuart, Iowa. Discovery of the bird flu on an Iowa turkey farm has raised serious concerns that the bird killer could find its way into chicken barns in the nation's top egg-producing state and rapidly decimate the flocks that provide the U.S. with its breakfast staple . The confirmation means up to 5.3 million hens there must be destroyed in a state that produces one in every five eggs consumed in the country. Seven other Midwestern states have also been hit by the virus, dooming nearly 7.8 million turkeys and chickens since March. The virulent strain in question is the H5N2, a highly contagious virus that kills commercial poultry quickly once it gets into a barn. Yet the risk to the public is considered low and infected birds are being kept out of the food supply. So far, only two egg operations have been hit — the one in Iowa and one in Wisconsin. Except for a couple of backyard flocks, all the other cases in the Midwest have been at commercial turkey farms. Minnesota has had 28 turkey farms hit, far more than any other state. Turkey farm: In this photo provided by Bethany Hahn is a flock of turkeys at a Minnesota poultry farm. The country's poultry industry may have to live with a deadly bird flu strain for several years according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture . Precautions: Most commercial poultry barns are shut tight to keep the diseases out, and poultry farms with good biosecurity strictly limit who is allowed in - but is does not always protect poultry from bird flu . Officials say that's because Minnesota is the top turkey-producing state, and its thousands of lakes and ponds are attractive to migrating ducks and other waterfowl. H5N2 and other highly pathogenic strains have also been found since late last year among wild birds, backyard flocks and commercial farms in some western states and British Columbia. U.S. Department of Agriculture officials say the virus could be a problem for several years. The USDA's chief veterinary officer, Dr. John Clifford, said last week that while new cases should drop close to zero once the weather warms up and kills off the virus there's 'very likely' to be a resurgence this fall when the wild waterfowl that are natural carriers of avian influenza fly south for the winter. An outbreak that kills tens of thousands of birds certainly can cost a farm dearly. The government doesn't compensate producers for birds that die of the disease itself, but it does reimburse them for birds that have to be euthanized as a precaution. That gives farmers an incentive to report suspected outbreaks and deal with them swiftly. Outbreaks do not always drive up the cost of turkey eggs and chicken as the toll nationwide represents just a small part of U.S. production. Hormel Foods Corp., which owns Jennie-O, said Monday that it will sell less turkey this year because of the outbreaks. Turkey prices around the holidays often have nothing to do with the costs of production. Retailers often sell turkeys at a loss just to draw in customers who'll stock up on stuffing mix, cranberries, sweet potatoes, pies and other traditional favorites. However, several precautions have been put in place at farms to control the outbreak and stop the spread of bird flu. Most commercial poultry barns are shut tight to keep the diseases out, and poultry farms with good biosecurity strictly limit who is allowed in. Other precautions  include workers often having to shower on their way in and out, wear protective coveralls and step in disinfectant to kill viruses on their boots. Equipment coming in and out is typically sanitized. But despite these measures, the system doesn't always work. According to experts, the only way it can work is if everyone does everything right all of the time - which can prove difficult. And if rodents and wild birds sneak into a barn it can bring the virus that way. Farms tend to be extremely diligent at handling  bird flu as turkeys die quickly and know how to spit the early warning signs. Less severe symptoms can be similar to colds and flu in humans, or a flock turning quiet. While vaccines have been used around the world to protect flocks against various bird flu strains ahead of time, this strain is new to North America. Once an infection is confirmed at a farm, all surviving birds on the property are typically killed to prevent it from spreading. These flocks are usually killed by pumping a water-based foam into the barn, following guidelines from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The foam suffocates the birds within minutes. If birds die they usually cover them in compost in the same barn where they died. Composting is a widely used and approved method throughout the industry to dispose of dead birds. It's thought to be an effective method as the heat generated by composting is enough to kill flu viruses and other pathogens commonly present in poultry such as salmonella. The compost is then used as fertilizer.","The deadly H5N2 bird flu virus has been found at a farm in northwest Iowa .

"Carol Chandler at Southwark Crown Court to answer charges of historic sexual abuse . A female teacher accused of abusing a pupil at Chancellor George Osborne’s old school appeared in court today. Carol Chandler, 53, allegedly molested a boy, under the age of 14 who was a pupil at top independent school St Paul’s in Barnes, south west London, during the 1980s. She is facing three counts of indecent assault and two counts of gross indecency between 1983 and 1985. Chandler appeared at Southwark Crown Court in a mint green wool skirt suit, black court shoes and silver jewellery. The charges have not yet been formally put and Chandler has not entered pleas. Judge Jeffrey Pegden QC told Chandler: ‘Yes madam, you have heard the next important hearing date for the case is going to be on 9 July.’ He added: ‘I renew your bail until that date on the single condition that is obviously necessary and I am sure you wouldn’t dream of it anyway - not to contact directly or indirectly any prosecution witnesses.’ Occupying a 45-acre site beside the Thames, near Hammersmith Bridge, St Paul’s boasts facilities including a purpose-built art gallery and 230-seat theatre, which are second to none. Famous former pupils of the top school, established in 1509, include the Chancellor, who attended the £32,000-a-year school in the eighties, Mumford and Sons banjo player Winston Marshall and TV presenter Dan Snow. Chandler is accused of 3 counts of indecent assault and 2 counts of gross indecency on a boy under 14 .

"If it feels as though summer has come early, that’s because we’re already enjoying August temperatures. This week’s remarkable spell of sunshine in southern England is to continue – and warm up. The temperature in the South is forecast to reach 24C (75F) today and 25C (77F) tomorrow, surpassing the highest seen so far this year, the 21.9C (71.4F) recorded in London on Friday. The delightful weather, caused by warm air blowing up from the Azores, is creating conditions we might usually experience in July or August. Scroll down for video . Beach life: People enjoy the weather at Barry Island  in south Wales yesterday, as most of England and Wales enjoys  warm spring conditions .

Unusual sight: A man appears to walk across a rainbow at the beach at Barry Island, near Cardiff in south Wales yesterday . Stunning: A fog bank rolling onto Portsmouth from the Solent, after cool air moved quickly over the surface of the warm water . Britons are so confident of a scorching summer that bookmakers are receiving tens of thousands of pounds in bets on this year breaking records. The record for the hottest day ever in Britain was set more than a decade ago in August 2003 when temperatures hit 38.1C (101F) in Gravesend, Kent. Coral’s price on this summer being the hottest on record has fallen from 10/1 to 2/1, while Ladbrokes has 5/6 on this spring being the warmest ever. There has been a surge in bets after the recent warm weather, and William Hill has 8/1 odds that the temperature will exceed 100F (37.8C) this year. Ladbrokes is also offering 8/1 that the April record of 29.4C (84.9F) set in 1949 in Camden, north London, will be broken by the end of the month. The forecast for today is actually warmer than the 18C (64F) average daytime temperature in August, and way ahead of the 11C (52F) normally expected in April. This weekend will be slightly cooler than the dizzy heights expected tomorrow, but the clear skies and above-average temperatures are forecast to last well into next week. Met Office spokesman Laura Young said last night: ‘We are expecting some really good temperatures over the next few days. Unless you are in north-west Scotland, which will see quite a lot of rain, it will be dry and sunny. ‘On Tuesday we could see 23C to 25C (73F to 77F) in prolonged sunshine. That is double the daytime average for this time of year. ‘Wednesday will be 22C to 25C (72F to 77F) or higher in places. Thursday will probably be slightly cooler but still in the high teens. Wednesday warmth: Most of England and Wales will enjoy sunshine over the next few days with temperatures hitting 24C later this week . Peak District awakening: The morning mist looking out across the Derbyshire village of Foolow, near Grindleford, which woke to a frost . Going for a walk: A deer in the morning mist near Foolow in Derbyshire yesterday, as Britons prepared for the warmest weather of the year so far . ‘There is a cold air mass arriving on Thursday night but it is expected to stay dry well into next week. After that we can be less certain.’ The spell of warm weather, which has now lasted more than a week, has seen people flocking to the nation’s beaches. Among them were swimmers in the South-West who were stunned to see giant jellyfish in the waters. Barrel jellyfish, which have tentacles up to six feet long, were spotted near Hope Cove in south Devon. The species are usually found in the sunnier climes of the Mediterranean, but the rising temperatures and warmer seas have meant that more plankton becomes available and the jellyfish have headed closer to shore. The species is harmless to humans, but with the weather warming up then other jellyfish could be heading our way. Beachgoers are advised not to touch jellyfish in case they have chanced upon a species with a powerful sting. Devon vet Rupert Kirkwood, whose son Henry had an encounter with one of the jellyfish while kayaking, said: ‘No doubt they are encouraged to put in an appearance by the sunny weather. I have never seen them so early in the year. Could be the start of a bumper jellyfish year.’ After the bad smog seen late last week in the South-East, the air will be relatively clear for most parts over the next few days.

Over the water: Sunrise near Cullercoats bay in North Tyneside, as Britain basked in the hottest temperatures of the year so far . But pollution levels will increase again on Thursday and Friday, particularly in the South-West, where Cornwall and Devon are expected to see fumes rise to dangerous levels. The Met Office three-month contingency forecast for public officials predicts that there is an average chance of a warmer than usual summer. But thankfully the chances of it being much colder than usual is just 10 per cent. A spokesman said: ‘Unfortunately, the weather we get in April doesn’t necessarily tell us anything about the kind of summer we can expect. ‘We’re still in the midst of spring, so it’s far too early to say what the months of June, July and August may hold.’ Ladbrokes spokesman David Williams said yesterday: ‘The money flooding in on weather bets is unusual and has taken us a bit by surprise. ‘This is the first time we have seen quite significant sums wagered on this specific bet - so obviously people out there sense something hot is coming.’ And Nicola McGeady from Coral added: 'The British public are obsessed with the weather and that is reflected in the interest in weather betting.' Hot day: These graphics show the cloud coverage and temperatures tomorrow, with the South East expected to have the best weather . Arriving: The predicted hot weather this week is the result of a plume of warm air heading towards the UK from the south west . Green for cold, red for hot: These graphics from Netweather show the forecast temperatures for tomorrow (left) and Wednesday (right) A third of weather bets to Ladbrokes have come from punters in the South East - the area that has enjoyed the best conditions over the past week. And the bookmaker said its biggest bet of the year so far has been £1,000 on 2015 to be the hottest year on record at 8/1 - placed in January. Meanwhile, Coral - MailOnline's official betting partner - said it has even had a request from someone asking to bet on rain every day this summer. The Met Office has confirmed that hotter-than-average temperatures are more than twice as likely than below-average conditions until June. It said in a long-range forecast that ‘much of the tropical Pacific Ocean remains warmer than average and close to El Nino thresholds’. El Nino - the warming of Pacific sea surface temperatures - can trigger drought in south-east Asia and Australia as well as floods in South America. The Met Office says most climate models ‘now suggest that sea surface temperatures will exceed El Nino thresholds in late spring or early summer’. With Britain set to bask in its hottest temperatures of the year so far this week, thousands of parents and children are expected to head to the beach. But firefighters have warned those thinking about stripping off and diving into the water - with more than 650 water-related deaths in the UK in 2013. The act, known as ‘tombstoning’, can lead to people suffering ‘cold water shock’ when the air temperature is much higher than that of the water. London Fire Brigade assistant commissioner Peter Cowup said: ‘Rivers, lakes and canals may look inviting, especially on a hot day and after a drink. ‘But it’s important to realise that open water has hidden dangers that can hurt you and at worse, kill you.’ On the first-ever Drowning Prevention and Water Safety Week, firefighters added that the 16-30 age group was worst-hit by water deaths in 2013. Giant jellyfish are being spotted off Britain earlier than normal thanks to the warm weather, it was claimed yesterday. Kayaker Rupert Kirkwood, a seasoned sea watcher, was stunned to see the giant creatures off Hope Cove in Devon. The barrel jellyfish, which have tentacles up to 6ft long, were pictured floating next to Mr Kirkwood’s kayak in the sun-drenched blue waters. Up close: Rupert Kirkwood's son Henry had this encounter with a barrel jellyfish near Hope Cove off the coast of south Devon . The species are usually found in more tropical areas such as the Mediterranean Sea.

Floating: The dustbin lid-shaped species is harmless to humans but with the weather warming up experts say more could be heading our way . The Red Cross says that anyone who does get stung should not try to use urine to provide relief as the healing properties of this are an urban myth. Vinegar is said to be far more effective. Vet Mr Kirkwood said: ‘No doubt they [are] encouraged to put in an appearance by the sunny weather. ‘I have never seen them so early in the year.

"Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini is braced for a ferocious derby clash at Old Trafford this weekend. The fading Barclays Premier League champions take on Manchester United on Sunday having unexpectedly fallen behind their arch-rivals in the table. For most of the season City, if not looking like mounting the strongest of title defences, at least seemed destined for a top-two finish. Manuel Pellegrini is relishing the prospect of taking on Manchester United with Manchester City on Sunday . David Silva (centre) leaves the pitch looking despondent after City's 2-1 loss to Crystal Palace on Monday . Sergio Aguero (centre) is blocked out by Damien Delaney (left) and James McArthur of Palace . That is now far from certain following a dramatic slump in fortunes while United, ordinary for much of the campaign, appear to have clicked into gear in the last month. With just a point separating them in third and fourth, the stage is set for a battle of high intensity. Pellegrini said: 'It is difficult to have a more intense match than you have in the Premier League every week but of course you add a little bit more for a derby of the city. Both teams want to win. 'It is important to be the winning team in the city - that gives an extra plus for the game, not only intensity is better but quality. 'Both teams have very good players and both managers like to play an attacking system so I hope (for a good game for) the fans, for whom you play, and after that I hope we can win.' City have held the edge over United in recent contests and could register a fifth successive derby win for the first time in their history with victory this weekend. A win would also see them become the first club to beat United five times in a row in the Premier League. United had the last laugh over City after the first of their current sequence of derby wins by winning the league in 2013 but since then the blues have had the bragging rights. Pellegrini said: 'I think that they have a lot of respect for our team because last year it was the team that dominated not only the derby but I think we dominated also the Premier League. It is not easy for a team. 'In the last three years we won two and in the other we were runner-up. This year we have been runner-up the whole year. 'We have to play seven games more and we will see what happens at the end of the season and in which position we will stay, but I think for them, they must try to beat the team that has been better in the last few years.' City are likely to come up against an altogether different opponent than the Crystal Palace side that frustrated them last Monday. Louis van Gaal's United have been fluid of late, winning impressively against Tottenham, Liverpool and Aston Villa to take their run of victories to five. Facing a side that is not inclined to sit back could suit City but Pellegrini is dismissive of suggestions that might make it easier than in their most recent away losses at Palace and Burnley. The Chilean said: 'You never know but I don't think it will be easy. It will be different. 'United are a big team that like to play - especially with Van Gaal. He's always an attacking manager. We hope we will see a good game. 'We have a different problem, we have to make sure we don't make mistakes because they have important and technically very good players.' Despite a wretched run of just four league wins in 11 games since pulling level at the top with Chelsea on New Year's Day, Pellegrini maintains all possibilities remain open to his side. City boss Pellegrini remains positive about City's achievements this season despite dropping down to fourth . Vincent Kompany is an injury doubt for Manchester City's clash against Manchester United on Sunday . 'I never think in a negative way,' said the 61-year-old, who will await the outcome of a fitness test on captain Vincent Kompany's hamstring injury. 'I don't think of one, two or three points difference when you have to play seven games. 'When you have mathematical options in football you must never give up and always believe you can do it.'","Manchester City are in fourth, a point behind rivals Manchester United .

"Given the inexorable march of the past 12 months in one direction, perhaps it is only appropriate that Rory McIlroy should spend the eve of the Masters on Wednesday with a member of the celebrated boy band of that name. But it is not lookalike Harry Styles who will carry the Northern Irishman's bag in the par-three tournament but keen golfer Niall Horan as McIlroy looks for a little light relief before his first attempt to complete a career Grand Slam. One Direction released their debut album in 2011, the same year McIlroy won his first major, so you could say they have mirrored each other, hit for greatest hit.

McIlroy celebrates with his  Wozniacki on the 9th hole during  the Par 3 contest at Augusta National Golf Club . At last year's Masters, McIlroy piqued the interest of one or two photographers when then fiancee Caroline Wozniacki donned the caddie's famous white boiler suit. He might find the curiosity levels are even greater this time, for One Direction are even more popular in the US than in Britain. Between them, Niall, an honorary member at Mullingar, Westmeath, and Rory might do more to stir up interest in golf among the young than any number of 'old fogey' initiatives. 'We met in Australia at the end of last year and he was saying he had never been to The Masters,' said McIlroy. 'I said if you're available on the Wednesday you're more than welcome to carry the bag. Niall's really excited.' Niall Horan will swap girls screams for Augusta greens as he caddies for golfer McIlroy . McIlroy hits a putt in the rain during a practice round prior to the start of the 2015 Masters Tournament . McIlroy looked more subdued than excited at his press conference yesterday, possibly because he knew what was coming. On the one hand, he feels as ready as he ever will for his tilt at history. On the other, he had to spend 30 minutes with journalists wanting to trawl over his poor record at Augusta. Here is a sample: Why is your record so bad on the par fives, Rory? Why have you never birdied either the first or the 10th holes? Why have you left here for the past five years with at least one 77 on your score card? What the hell's wrong given all the advantages offered by your length off the tee? McIlroy  walks over the Nelson Bridge with caddie J.P. Fitzgerald during a practice round . To be fair, he answered them all with politeness. After all, there was nothing there he had not analysed and dissected countless times himself. McIlroy knows better than anyone he has no chance unless he does better on the long holes. He brought up the point raised in the Sportsmail graphic from last Saturday, which compared his record on the par fives last year with that of winner Bubba Watson. 'Just look at the two par fives on the back nine on Sunday,' he said. 'I had a nine iron in my hand for my second shot on both and I walked off with two sixes. Two fours I'd have finished third. McIlroy waits under an umbrella during a practice round prior to the start of the 2015 Masters Tournament . 'It's something I've been thinking about a lot. Look at Bubba, who played them in eight-under for the week to my level par and beat me by eight shots. 'I've just been too aggressive at times. I had four sixes on par-fives last year, so if I can clean up those, I'll have a chance to win.' As for those 77s, he said: 'It's not like I'm having a bad 18 holes. It's always just a bad nine holes that causes the damage and it's usually on a Friday, like last year. But I am better equipped now to handle it if things don't go right way. Mentally, I'm in a far better place.' McIlroy conceded that the circus surrounding Tiger Woods's return had not been unhelpful and the draw has worked out pretty well, too. The place you do not want to be come Thursday is in one of the last two groups, like Woods, but McIlroy has been treated kindly, with a mid-morning threesome alongside Americans Phil Mickelson and Ryan Moore. 'I don't think I've played alongside Phil at Augusta so that's perfect,' he said. 'We always get along well and he has a great record here. It will be fun to watch him.' It was this time last week, while practising in Florida, that McIlroy pronounced himself ready to go. 'It's been great not to have to think of anything technical while I'm playing,' he said. 'I've been able to enjoy the build-up.' Rory McIlroy waits with his caddie Fitzgerald in the rain during a practice round  at Augusta National Golf Club . Asked who he saw as favourite, McIlroy went for Bubba — ironic given a recent ESPN survey among the pros ranked Watson as the least favourite. 'I take it as I need to improve as a man,' said Watson, with the sort of annoying comment that explains his unpopularity in the first place. As for McIlroy, he knows where he needs to improve. 'You look at this course and it should fit me perfectly from tee to green,' he said. After One Direction on Wednesday, it'll be his turn to generate some roars.","One Direction star Niall Horan will caddie for Rory McIlroy on Wednesday .

"Dele Alli has set his sights on the Toulon Tournament with England Under 20s as he aims to cap a season that will live long in his memory. The 19-year-old's impressive performances for Milton Keynes Dons earned him a dream move to the Premier League with Tottenham Hotspur in a £5million deal rubber-stamped in January. Loaned back to the Dons for the remainder of the season, Alli's 14 goals have helped keep them in touch with the automatic promotion places in League One. Dele Alli has set his sights on playing for England Under 20s at the Toulon Tournament next month . Dele ALli has impressed for MK Dons this season leading to Tottenham signing him for £5m in January . Alli laid on two assists for team-mate Carl Baker during the Dons' 3-0 home win over Doncaster Rovers on Tuesday night, a result that leaves them a point behind second-placed Preston North End with two matches to play. The season has seen progress for Alli on the international scene too, with good performances for Sean O'Driscoll's Under 19 team. His absence through an ankle injury was a big blow as the team failed to qualify for the Under 19 European Championships but Alli could compensate for that by winning a place in Aidy Boothroyd's Under 20 squad for Toulon next month. Alli told The FA.com: 'I'm not going to lie and say it isn't [a target]. You want to do as well as you can. The aim is to eventually get into the first team. Alli keeps his eyes on the ball as he shoots  during MK Dons' victory against Doncaster Rovers on Tuesday . Alli was named Football League Young Player of the Year at the Football League Awards last Sunday . 'Obviously the next step to that is the Under 21s and that's the aim for me to try and break into that squad or the Under 20s. 'I really enjoyed playing for the Under 19s last year, especially with the team we had and the manager. 'We played a real attractive game, and we liked to play football and that is what I'm used to so it wasn't like I was going away and playing a whole new story. 'I've really enjoyed it and obviously my aim is to eventually get into the seniors. So any age group I play in, the better for me. 'The aim next year for me is to play at the highest level I can for England.' Alli poses alongside FA chairman Greg Dyke (left) at the Awards in London on Sunday night . England have been drawn in Group B of the Toulon Tournament with China, Ivory Coast, Mexico and Morocco. They begin their campaign against Morocco on May 28. His influential performance against Doncaster continued another good week for the midfielder, who was voted Young Player of the Year at the Football League Awards on Sunday night. 'It was a real honour to win it - especially with the players I was up against in Patrick [Bamford of Middlesbrough] and Nathan Redmond [of Norwich]. 'They're great players, and from playing with Patrick last season [during his loan spell at MK Dons], I know just how good he is, so it was a great honour and achievement for me.

"Charlie Austin is being considered for a surprise England call up for the national team’s summer fixtures after scoring 17 goals for relegation-threatened QPR. Austin is in contention because Harry Kane, who scored on his debut against Lithuania last month and made his first start against Italy in Turin, will be with Gareth Southgate’s Under-21 team. The QPR striker will continue to be monitored by England head coach Roy Hodgson and assistant Ray Lewington ahead of the friendly with Republic of Ireland on June 7 and the Euro 2016 qualifier in Slovenia seven days later. Charlie Austin, in action against Chelsea on Sunday, has scored 17 times for Queens Park Rangers this term .

"That's not a light lunch, it's just bad lighting, say administrators at a Virginia School standing up for their FLOTUS approved school meals. A concerned mother took a photo of her child's lunch consisting of a dull looking fish fillet, a whole wheat bun, and corn and then posted it to social media this week. Virginia’s Portsmouth Public Schools say that their lunches are in compliance with Michelle Obama's federal lunch rules. Scroll down for video . Look appetizing?: A corned mother took a photo of her child's lunch, a dull looking fish fillet, a whole wheat bun, and corn and then posted it to social media this week . Reasoning: Virginia’s Portsmouth Public Schools say that their lunches are in compliance with Michelle Obama's federal lunch rules . After the photo began circulating the web, Food Service Coordinator Jim Gehlhoff said the lunch was 'concerning' but that it may not actually be as bad as it looks, reports EAG News. 'Poor lighting and food presentation make this lunch unappealing,' he said in a statement released to the media. 'The meal in this photo and other meals served by Portsmouth Public Schools meet nutritional and USDA requirements,' said Gelhoff. According to the school district's lunch menu from their website, Tuesday’s lunch options included spicy Cajun fish with brown rice, a cold cut turkey sandwich, a chef's salad, fresh orange or canned fruit, and 1 per cent skim milk. Wavy took a poll asking people if the though the lunch seemed acceptable and 92.3 per cent of people who voted didn't believe that the lunch looked palatable. 'No child should go to school hungry – it’s that simple,' committee chair Rep. John Kline said at a House Education and Workforce Committee this week. 'Today’s discussion is not about whether we agree on this basic principle; I am confident we all do. Instead, our discussion today is about beginning a larger effort we will continue in the coming months to ensure the best policies are in place to help reach this goal,' he continued. Another paltry lunch: This lunch posted in October shows another American student's dissatisfaction with the school meal . Squeamish: This school lunch allegedly shows a maggot found in a child's green beans . The School Nutrition association doesn’t think Michelle Obama's lunch regulations are to blame but they think a funding increase is needed for the National School Lunch Program. ‘That will help school food authorities afford the foods that we must serve, but unfortunately that won’t make students consume it,’ SNA President Julia Bauscher said during testimony. ‘And that’s what we’re also focused on…finding ways to ensure students will eat the healthy foods that we’re making available to them and not throw it in the trash.’ Two months ago Michelle Obama again came under fire for the 'shortcomings' of her Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act scheme. Students and parents  posted photos of Michelle Obama's 'measly' school lunches in February and in October of last year. The images, which were all posted on Twitter with the hashtag #ThanksMichelleObama, range from a slice of moldy salami in a wrap and a green hotdog to a small portion of salad with a side of cheese, to a maggot found in a child's green beans.

"If you struggle to get your child to go to school in the morning, don’t blame them - it could be your fault. Our willingness to learn - or lack thereof - is significantly influenced by our genes, according to a large study. The researchers found that 40 to 50 per cent of the differences in children’s motivation to learn could be explained by their genetic inheritance from their parents. Our willingness to learn is significantly influence by our genes, according to a study by Goldsmiths University in London and Ohio State University. More than 13,000 twins aged nine to 16 took part in the research (stock image shown) Psychologists from Goldsmiths University of London, and Ohio State University in the US studied more than 13,000 twins aged nine to 16 from six countries, including the UK, Canada, Japan, Germany, Russia and the US. The researchers said they were surprised by the results, believing that the twins’ shared environment - elements such as the teachers and the family that they had in common - would be a larger factor than genetics. Instead, genetics and non-shared-environment factors had the largest effect on the children’s motivation to learn, whereas the shared environment had negligible impact. Genetics and non-shared-environment factors were found to have the largest effect on the children’s motivation to learn, whereas the shared environment had negligible impact (stock image shown) A review of 308 studies involving more than 1.1 million children has now completely overturned this long-held stereotype. The study, which looked at data from 1914 to 2011, suggests that girls do better in school than boys - and have been doing so for at least 100 years. The research also claims that girls do better at all ages, in all subjects and all over the world. According to the data, compiled by the University of New Brunswick in Canada, girls have been outperforming boys throughout their academic careers, from infant school to secondary school. Accordingly, we should not jump to conclusions that a poor teacher or the child themselves is to blame for a lack of motivation in the classroom, the researchers said. ‘We had pretty consistent findings across these different countries with their different educational systems and different cultures,’ said Professor Stephen Petrill, of Ohio State University. ‘It was surprising. The knee-jerk reaction is to say someone is not properly motivating the student, or the child himself is responsible. ‘We found that there are personality differences that people inherit that have a major impact on motivation. ‘That doesn’t mean we don’t try to encourage and inspire students, but we have to deal with the reality of why they are different.’ The results don’t mean there is a specific gene for how much children enjoy learning, he added, but they suggest a complex process, involving many genes and gene-environment interactions that help influence a child’s motivation to learn. The study will be published in the journal Personality and Individual Differences.","Willingness to learn is significantly influence by our genes .

"Ethel Rider, who has severe dementia, fell from her bed at the Half Acre Care Home in Radcliffe, when she was being turned to prevent bed sores . Two care home workers who left a mute dementia patient in agony after she fell on the floor, then lied about what had happened, have been jailed. Ethel Rider, 87, suffered a broken pelvis and was left ‘cowering’ in pain after falling from her bed. But even though the grandmother was in agony, her carers failed to seek medical help and simply lifted her back into bed. Because she is mute, Mrs Rider was unable to tell anyone what had happened. It was only 24 hours later that a nurse realised she was in agonising pain and called an ambulance. The injury occurred because one of her carers, Susan Logan, had tried to turn her by herself – against the proper procedure at the private home. But when asked what had happened, Logan and her supervisor, Lauren Gillies, lied, saying Mrs Rider had fallen out of bed. Yesterday both were beginning six-month prison sentences after a judge branded them ‘idle’, saying they had cut corners to give themselves longer breaks. Afterwards the pensioner’s family slammed the carers’ ‘disgusting’ betrayal and said they were pleased both had been jailed. The Daily Mail’s Dignity for the Elderly campaign has repeatedly highlighted examples of poor care in residential homes and on NHS wards. Mrs Rider, a retired factory worker, moved into the Half Acre Care Home in Radcliffe, near Manchester, where staff working in pairs were meant to turn her in bed every two hours. But on May 19 last year, Logan, 59, was trying to turn Mrs Rider by herself when the pensioner fell out of bed. Bolton Crown Court heard how it may have been some time before the emergency alarm was called and Gillies, 25, arrived to find the grandmother in pain and on the floor. ‘She was left on the floor for 40 minutes,’ said Jonathan Turner, prosecuting. ‘She was then hoisted back into the bed. No ambulance was called and the story was devised between the two of them.’ The court heard how Mrs Rider, who now has the mental capacity of a baby, is mute and would have been unable to convey the pain of being hoisted back into bed with a broken pelvis. Care workers Lauren Gillies, 25 (left) and Susan Logan, 59, (right) have been jailed for six months each . Logan, of Radcliffe, and Gillies, of Ramsbottom, admitted wilful neglect. Judge Timothy Stead told them: ‘What you did between the two of you was outrageous. Your decisions have been described as stupid, but I would use a stronger word. They were criminally wrong.’ Mrs Rider’s daughter Julie Murphy, 52, from Radcliffe, said: ‘I am satisfied they have been jailed. What they did is disgusting.’ Four Seasons Health Care, which runs the home, said: ‘We are very sorry for the distress caused to Mrs Rider and her family as a result of the actions of the carers.’ A spokesman for the care home said they were 'very sorry for the distress caused to Mrs Rider and her family'","Ethel Rider, 87, dropped from her bed at Half Acre Care Home in Radcliffe .

"An Oregon lawmaker proposed legislation Monday creating uniform standards for hand dryers in public restrooms. The bill says that the recent proliferation of powerful dryers is efficient, but can sometimes trigger ringing of in the ears, or cause discomfort for people with development or sensory disabilities. The measure would require all new or replacement dryers to operate at a noise level no louder than 84 decibels. According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that is about as loud as a school cafeteria. A measure proposed to the Oregon legislature would require all new or replacement dryers to operate at a noise level no louder than 84 decibels, about as loud as a school cafeteria. (File photo) It also wouldn't allow hand dryers blowing air downwards to blow air faster than 115 mph, in case the hand-dryer manufacturer doesn't label the decibel level. Bill sponsor Democratic Sen. Chris Edwards told the Senate Committee on Business and Transportation that the new generation of hand dryers used to elicit episodes in his autistic son, who would cry and cover his ears when he heard them. It's not the hand-dryer motor that's too loud, Edwards said, it's the 'air knife' against the hand that can cause a sharp, shrill sound. 'I almost didn't bring this bill because this is not the most consequential bill of the legislative session. We all know that,' Edwards said. Democratic Senator Chris Edwards (left) sponsored the bill after his autistic son had episodes after hearing loud hand dryers. Republican senator Chuck Thomsen (right) says he prefers paper hand drying . 'But nonetheless there are those of us that just find these hand dryers to be extraordinarily obnoxious and disruptive to family members.' The bill would also 'requires downward blowing hand dryer to not blow air at an air velocity that exceeds 115 miles per hour'. High-speed, efficient new hand dryers, such as the Dyson Airblade or the Excel Xlerator, are fast replacing the old models, which often left hands still dripping wet. Still, there are some who would prefer if hand dryers were a thing of the past altogether. 'The new ones are faster, but I still would ban them all and go back to paper,' said Republican Sen. Chuck Thomsen of Hood River. The bill, SB 488, is scheduled for a hearing on Wednesday.","Bill would require all new dryers to be no louder than 84 decibels .

Tickets for the fight were expected to cost between £1,000 and £5,000 in the 16,500-seat Grand Garden arena in the Las Vegas Casino. But those prices have incredibly tripled in the resale market before they have even gone on public sale.

Meanwhile Pacquiao's manager blamed the opposing fighter's camp for holding up the ticket sales, claiming they refused to sign an agreement drawn up months ago. Michael Koncz said: 'It's a real mess right now... I can only surmise the motivation is greed and an attempt to manipulate the tickets, otherwise why the hold up?

Authorities said that they suspected the music stars were in possession of drugs when 'a very potent smell' of marijuana was detected coming from their two tour buses. When Migos left to perform at Georgia Southern University's Hanner Fieldhouse arena over the weekend, investigators seized the opportunity to conduct a search. Multiple guns, marijuana and another undisclosed drug were discovered inside the vehicles,  officials said. They added that the discoveries 'were intensely concerning' as they had been brought to a university-sponsored event where over a thousand students were congregated.

It wasn't known early Monday if they had attorneys. Phone calls and emails to the group's management team by the Associated Press were not immediately returned. About a dozen other suspects - all occupants of the two vans - were also taken into custody following the concert. Information about them and the charges they face were not immediately available.

"(CNN)Ever had a headache so big, you felt like drilling a hole in your head to let the pain out? In Neolithic times trepanation -- or drilling a hole into the skull -- was thought to be a cure for everything from epilepsy to migraines. It could even have been a form of emergency surgery for battle wounds. But while there is still conjecture about the real reasons behind the mysterious procedure, what is known is that the implement often used to carry out the primitive surgery was made from one of the sharpest substances found in nature -- obsidian. Obsidian -- a type of volcanic glass -- can produce cutting edges many times finer than even the best steel scalpels. At 30 angstroms -- a unit of measurement equal to one hundred millionth of a centimeter -- an obsidian scalpel can rival diamond in the fineness of its edge. When you consider that most household razor blades are 300-600 angstroms, obsidian can still cut it with the sharpest materials nano-technology can produce. Even today, a small number of surgeons are using an ancient technology to carry out fine incisions that they say heal with minimal scarring. Dr. Lee Green, professor and chair of the Department of Family Medicine at the University of Alberta, says he routinely uses obsidian blades. ""The biggest advantage with obsidian is that it is the sharpest edge there is, it causes very little trauma to tissue, it heals faster and more importantly it heals with less scarring,"" he said. ""It makes for the best cosmetic outcome."" He explained that steel scalpels at a microscopic level have a rough cutting edge that tears into tissue, a function of the crystals that make up the metal. Obsidian, meanwhile, cleaves into a fine and continuous edge when properly cut. Dr. Green said he once helped documentary makers produce a program on surgical technology in ancient Egyptian, setting up a blind test on the cutting power of obsidian. Using cultured-skin burn dressing, a substance composed of skin cells, he made an incision with a modern scalpel and a parallel incision with an obsidian scalpel. The host of the program was then invited to look at the cuts under a video microscope and tell the difference. ""It wasn't hard to tell the difference at all -- as soon as he turned around everyone in the studio was like 'Ohhh',"" Dr. Green said. ""Under the microscope you could see the obsidian scalpel had divided individual cells in half, and next to it the steel scalpel incision looked like it had been made by a chainsaw."" Modern obsidian scalpels look nothing like the decorative flint-knapped knives of Neolithic man, often resembling their modern counterparts in everything except for the blade edge, but Dr. Green said they are a very different animal. ""The feel is very different because obsidian has no 'bite,'"" he said. ""If you look under the microscope at a steel scalpel edge it looks almost like a saw, it has teeth, whereas obsidian is smooth even microscopically. ""It's a very different feel to work with and you have to practice before you start using it in surgery. ""You also have to be careful not to nick yourself with it because you don't even feel it!"" And Dr. Green believes incisions made with these blades heal faster. He said a colleague who needed a mole removed agreed to undergo an experiment where half the procedure was carried out with an obsidian scalpel and the other half was removed with steel. ""What's really fun is seeing it heal,"" he said. ""Four weeks later the difference was quite remarkable -- there was very much a difference in scarring."" In Germany, the manufacturer Fine Science Tools produces obsidian scalpels which can be used in situations where the patient may have an allergy to steel or metal. ""For studies where trace metals from ordinary scalpel blades cannot be tolerated, these very special obsidian scalpels may provide the answer,"" the company says. At €99 per scalpel ($107.40), they represent a considerable saving on their diamond cousins which the company prices at €712.50 ($772.60). But there has been little academic research into the efficacy of obsidian blades compared to steel scalpels, and they do have disadvantages: Obsidian scalpels are not Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved, and they are extremely brittle and prone to breaking if lateral forces are applied -- meaning they are unlikely to ever be in widespread use. Dr. Green, whose scalpels were manufactured for him by an expert flint-knapper and archaeologist Errett Callahan, concedes the Stone Age scalpels are not for everyone. ""If it was let loose on the market there'd be far too many injuries from it,"" he said. ""It's very fragile and it's very easy to break pieces off.""","Obsidian can produce cutting edges many times finer than even the best steel scalpels .
Some surgeons still use the blades in procedures today .",029f5f6775ecd8b5fad0dc0e55ab4a9754fcad8f
"Ed Balls has been accused of treating the public with 'contempt' after dismissing as a 'joke' the infamous Labour note admitting the party had blown the nation's finances. The shadow chancellor said the letter, left in the Treasury by the former Labour minister Liam Byrne in 2010, was just a 'jokey note'. Mr Byrne's glib note to his successor as Treasury Secretary stated: 'Dear Chief Secretary, I'm afraid there is no money. Kind regards – and good luck! Liam.' Scroll down for video . Damaging: Labour's Liam Byrne sent left this handwritten note to his successor before he left the Treasury in 2010 . The note has become emblematic of Labour's fiscal irresponsibility in office and was used by David Cameron in the seven-way leaders' debate earlier this month. When the Coalition took office in 2010 the budget deficit had reached more than £150billion – more than 10 per cent of the entire size of the economy. But Mr Ball insisted the note admitting that Labour had blown the nation's finances should not be taken seriously. He told BBC West Midlands: 'Liam Byrne's note was a jokey note… of the course the money hadn't run out.' Mr Balls said Labour would cut the deficit – still running at £90billion a year – every year. He said: 'Nothing in our manifesto is going to require additional borrowing. I think in tough times, people want a government which will make tough decisions, and will make the sums add up, and that is what we're saying very clearly today.' But he was asked if Labour was 'credible' and could be trusted with the economy. Mr Balls said: 'I think people want to know the sums add up. People know that the global financial crisis wasn't caused by Labour's spending – it wasn't Labour's spending on nurses and doctors which meant the Lehman Brothers investment bank went bankrupt in New York. 'Liam Byrne's note was a jokey note, of course the money hadn't run out.' Ed Balls, pictured in Birmingham today, said the letter, left in the Treasury by the former Labour minister Liam Byrne in 2010, was just a 'jokey note' Mr Balls blamed the Lib Dem minister David Laws for leaking the note. He said it was supposed to be a private note, adding: 'It was supposed to be a piece of humour. In fact, in that year, the government spend hundreds of billions of pounds, so of course the money hadn't run out, but there was a large deficit, and we had to get it down, and we needed to get it down in a fair way. 'The reason why we're more credible than the Tories now is that they're not people who understand the need for change in the economy, it's not been all in it together, they've not even balanced the books – it's going to take a Labour government to do it.' Former Treasury Secretary Liam Byrne left the note to his successor David Laws in 2010 . The Tories this morning slammed Mr Balls's remarks – claiming they showed that he had not learnt the lessons from the great economic crash. Treasury minister David Gauke said: 'The fact that Ed Balls thinks the debt they left the country was a 'joke' goes to show the contempt they hold the public in. 'It is clear Labour has not learnt the lessons of the past and would do the same all over again - more taxes, more borrowing and more debt.' The letter has haunted Labour for years, allowing Tory and Liberal Democrat ministers to prove the nation's coffers were empty. The letter consisting of just 18 words it offers no apology or justification for the state of the nation's finances, only a glib 'good luck' to whoever was left to clear up the economic mess. Written in blue ink on government note paper, it was opened by Lib Dem David Laws who became Chief Secretary to the Treasury when the coalition was formed. Lib Dem Mr Laws said: 'He left a note which frankly does sum up precisely the state of the Treasury when he left it. I think it is refreshing that a Labour politician has been prepared to admit that.' Mr Byrne has admitted he will regret it for the rest of his life. He said: 'It was a very foolish thing to do. 'I suppose I did think there was a convention amongst honourable members that private correspondence would stay private. 'There's obviously a very old tradition of these notes that goes back to the 1930s. I felt disappointed that some very old conventions had been cast aside for political advantage.'","Letter was left in the Treasury by the former minister Liam Byrne in 2010 .

"Stock market returns have averaged 16 per cent a year under David Cameron's Conservatives party, compared to just under nine per cent under Labour . Shares have performed nearly twice as well under Conservative governments than under Labour over the last 45 years, according to figures published today. Stock market returns have averaged 16 per cent a year under the Tories compared with just under 9 per cent under Labour and just over 9 per cent under the current Coalition. The figures, in an analysis for the Daily Mail by investment company Hargreaves Lansdown, are a further boost for David Cameron and George Osborne ahead of the general election on May 7. Ed Miliband is struggling to win over business men and women as well as investors who are worried about a Left-wing Labour government’s attitudes to enterprise. A survey of FTSE 100 bosses this weekend showed 70 per cent believe a Labour government under Mr Miliband would be a ‘catastrophe’ for the economy. The analysis by Hargreaves Lansdown shows investors – including millions of workers saving for a pension – fare better under the Conservatives. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ‘The stock market has performed twice as well under a Conservative government as it has under Labour, according to performance statistics dating back to 1970.’ The analysis shows that companies have also performed better under the Tories with profits up by an average of 11 per cent a year under the Conservatives and 6 per cent under Labour. Writing in the Daily Mail, Mr Khalaf said: ‘Over the last 45 years there have been five Conservative governments, five Labour governments, and the current Coalition. ‘Over that time the UK stock market has returned on average 16 per cent a year under Conservative rule, compared with 9 per cent under Labour. ‘Markets can be capricious beasts in the short term, but on average this trend reflects the growth in UK company profits under the two parties.’ However, he said events on the global stage ‘are far more important to the UK stock market than the next resident of Number 10’. He added: ‘Looking back over the last 45 years, the waxing and waning of the stock market has been driven in large part by overseas influences, and is not commanded from Westminster. This makes sense when you consider how globalised most industries are.’ Experts have warned that a hung parliament could send financial markets into a tailspin and the pound and shares crashing. A survey of FTSE 100 bosses  showed 70 per cent believe a Labour government  would be a ‘catastrophe’ for the economy. The analysis by Hargreaves Lansdown shows investors fare better under the Conservatives . All the major pollsters are predicting that no party will win an overall majority. George Buckley, UK economist at Deutsche Bank, said: ‘The 2015 UK general election is set to be the most unpredictable for nearly a century. ‘Polls suggest that neither of the two major parties may have sufficient support to secure an outright majority. ‘There may be no good outcome for investors.’ A hard-hitting report by BlackRock, the largest fund manager in the world, said ‘a soothing outcome for the markets is hard to imagine’ given Labour’s anti-business policies and Tory plans to hold a referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union. ‘Labour would be tough on business – and might be perceived as lacking fiscal responsibility,’ the US giant said in the report. ‘A Conservatives-dominated Cabinet would pave the way for an unsettling referendum in 2017 on the UK’s EU membership. ‘Whoever wins – and the result could take some time to emerge – will lead a weak government likely to pass only watered-down legislation.’","Shares have performed nearly twice as well under Tories, new figures show .

"Aaron Hernandez left behind his life as a millionaire star athlete today, swapping a designer suit for a set of gray scrubs at a prison  where he will begin a life sentence for murder. It is perhaps fitting that Hernandez was booked at MCI Cedar Junction in Walpole, a prison just across the freeway from Gillette Stadium where he used to play for the New England Patriots. Hernandez hasn't set foot in the stadium since June 2013, when he was arrested under suspicion of murdering Odin Lloyd, who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fianceé at the time. On Wednesday, a 12-person jury found Hernandez guilty, sentencing him to life in prison without the possibility of parole due to some especially heinous aspects of Lloyd's killing. Scroll down for video . The beginning of the rest of his life: Aaron Hernandez was taken to the MCI Cedar Juntion prison in Walpole, Massachusetts on Wednesday after he was sentenced to life in prison without parole for the 2013 murder of Odin Lloyd. Hernandez circled in red, arriving at the 700-inmate prison . Old neighborhood: Cedar Junction is about a mile and a half away from Gillette Stadium, where Hernandez used to play tight end for the New England Patriots . Nothing to smile about now: Hernandez slumped down in his chair on Wednesday as a guilty verdict was read (left). Pictured on the right during happier times, playing for the Patriots . Hernandez was shocked by the decision, mouthing 'You're wrong', before slumping to his seat - perhaps seeing the riches to rags reality of his new life. Hernandez has vowed to appeal the decision. Directly after court, Hernandez was taken to the 700-inmate facility that will serve as a stark contrast to his former home - a $1.3million mansion. Hernandez arrived at Cedar Junction around 1pm for booking and was given the prison number W106228. The booking process took about two hours, and was probably not the most comfortable of experiences. According to a report by WBUR, new inmates at the facility are taken downstairs into the basement where the intake center is located. It is there that they change into their new uniform of gray scrubs and laceless canvas shoes, turning over their personal clothes to be either incinerated or mailed home. New home: Hernandez is starting his sentence at maximum-security prison MCI Cedar Junction in Walpole, Massachusetts (pictured above) Stately: Before his arrest, Hernandez lived in a $1.3million mansion in North Attleborough, Massachusetts (pictured above . They then post for a new mugshot and are fingerprinted before sitting in a special chair that scans their bodies for possible hidden objects. All new inmates receive a paper bag containing seven pairs of underwear and a specially-designed razor and pen that can't be used as a weapon. Jerry-rigged weapons are something Hernandez should be concerned with, according to Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hogson. Sheriff Hogson spoke with WHDH after the ruling on Wednesday and said that as the focus of a high-profile case, Hernandez will be targeted in the prison. 'It depends how he's classified or where he'll be, but it's always a possibility, always a concern,' Hodgson said. Labor: Workers at Cedar Junction's prison manufacture license plates for 50 cents an hour - a far cry from the $40million contract extension Hernandez received from the Patriots in 2012 . The food at Cedar Junction was described by a Boston Globe reporter as 'marginally edible'. Hernandez pictured above eating chicken after a Patriots game . Some other aspects of prison life may not be up to Hernandez's standards either - such as the 50 cents an hour inmates are paid to manufacture license plates. In 2012, the Patriots extended Hernandez's contract for five years in a $40million deal that was unprecedented for a tight end. Also in 2012, he signed a deal to be a spokesman for shoe brand Puma. And for a former professional athlete who's used to eating large satisfying meals, Hernandez may lose his appetite in the cafeteria where the food was once described by a Boston Globe reporter as 'marginally edible'. Cedar Point is where all male inmates are booked when they start their sentences in Massachusetts, so Hernandez will eventually be moved to another facility in the coming weeks or months, . It's reported that he will be sent to Sousa Baranowski Correctional Center in Shirley, Massachusetts next.

"She's won the London Marathon three times but this weekend Paula Radcliffe says she'll be happy to finish at all regardless of her position. The 41-year-old mother-of-two has battled back from injury to take part in the 26.2 mile race in the capital and a result won't be running with the other female elites but with the masses. She said this week: 'I'm going in unfit and unprepared for a marathon, but I'm hoping my body can remember once it gets out there how it's supposed to do it.' Scroll down for video . Paula Radcliffe finishes the London Marathon on Sunday after running with the masses to bring down the curtain on her professional running career . Paula was delighted she could return to London to run the marathon again . The mother-of-two has won the London Marathon three times, including in 2003 when she set her phenomenal word record time of 2 hours 15 minutes and 25 seconds . 'Unfit' for Paula actually means a time most runners can only dream of, and she's still likely to clock one of the fastest times of the day from a British woman. It will be an emotional run for Paula who will be presented with the the inaugural John Disley Lifetime Achievement award in honour of her achievements, which include setting a still unbeaten world record time of 2 hours 15 minutes and 25 seconds in London in 2003. Her great success over the years has also come with some heartache as she has never won an Olympic medal and often been let down by her body as she's pushed it to her limits. So as she prepares to run the marathon - supposedly for the last time - FEMAIL looks back on the career of the inspirational running super mother... Paula started running for Bedford and County from a young age, left, and won numerous races as a junior before progressing to take the European cross-country in 1998, right . The GB vests kept coming but she missed out on a medal at the Sydney Olympics in 2000 . Paula gave her all at the 2000 Olympics but was out-sprinted in the final moments and finished fourth . Paula's talent for running was evident from a young age and, under the coaching guidance of Alex Stanton at Bedford and County Athletics Club, she became accustomed to winning races on the domestic circuit. By the time she was a teenager, she had pulled on the first of her many Great Britain vests, winning junior races at the World Cross Country Championships and on the track. As a student at Loughborough University, she gained a first-class degree in modern languages while continuing to keep up her training regime. It was as student that she met her husband, Gary Lough - himself a talented middle distance runner - who went on to become her manager and training partner as well as the father of her two children. After leaving university, Paula embarked on her career as a full-time athlete and continued to have success in cross country races and on the track. She again lost out on a medal at the 2001 World Champs - which led to a public spat with husband Gary Lough who shared her disappointment . It was in Edmonton that Paula also made her stance on drugs in sport clear . But at major championships her valiant efforts to win a medal kept resulting in her getting out-sprinted in the home straight. She was fourth in the 5000m at the 1997 World Championships, fifth at the European Championships over 10,000m a year later and then fourth at the Sydney Olympic Games. At the World Championships in Edmonton in 2001 she was determined to make the podium - but after front-running she was again out-kicked in the final lap. This disappointment was her most famous as it led to a very public row with Gary - who criticised her race tactics when many thought he should have been consoling her. Gary was portrayed as a villain in the press - something that hurt the couple deeply. Success came on the track in 2002 as she won gold at the European Champs . She also took the gold in the 2002 Commonwealth Games 5k in front of a home crowd in Manchester . Her popularity soared as she was awarded an MBE in June 2002 and later that year was voted the BBC's Sports Personality of the Year, pictured here holding the coveted trophy . Speaking to the Evening Standard in 2012,  Paula said such heated arguments occur because: 'Gary understands what makes me tick and wants to support me as much as he can to achieve that. 'Sometimes that can cause blow ups - we are both strong-minded individuals but we have always said to each other that we should say what we want all the time. We never sleep on an argument because that is dangerous.' It was also in Edmonton that Paula made a public stand against drugs cheats holding up a banner saying 'EPO cheats out'. She's remained a staunch anti-drugs campaigner throughout her career and has called for tougher testing measures. Despite this, she's also had to face accusations that she couldn't have achieved her marathon World Record clean - as it's a time that hasn't been surpassed in 12 years. She said earlier this year she finds such unfounded accusations 'horrible'. 'I get it all the time. People saying ""she couldn't have run 2.15 clean"" but I know I can be totally proud,' she said. In 2003 she smashed the marathon world record as she won in London . In 2003 her form on the roads continued as she set also world records over 5k and 10k . But at the 2004 Athens Olympics, she was forced to drop out of the race despite being favourite to win . Paula was devastated she couldn't finish the Olympic marathon as her body was depleted by medication she had to take following a collision with a bike in training beforehand . The athlete felt she'd let everyone down and cried at the press conference . 'It makes you think we have to put a system in place that protects clean athletes. There will be some Russians athletes who are not cheating, there are a lot of Kenyan athletes out there who are not cheating and they are all being lumped together. It spoils it so we have to do something to protect them and the sport.' Paula bounced back from the disappointment in Edmonton to have a victorious year in 2002 over all terrain. She won the World Cross Country Championships and the London Marathon and finally took gold medals on the track at the Commonwealth Games and then the European Championships. She bounced back from the Olympic disappointment to take victory at the London Marathon again in 2005 . But the race will be remembered for the toilet stop she took en route . She also won a gold medal at the World Champs in 2005 over the marathon distance . Her popularity soared as she was awarded an MBE in June 2002 and later that year was voted the BBC's Sports Personality of the Year. In 2003 she ran her incredible world record marathon time pushing the pace from start to finish without another competitor in sight. She also set world records over 10k and 5k on the roads in the same year. As a result, in 2004 she went into the Athens Olympics marathon as the firm favourite and hopes were high that she would finally win the gold Olympic medal she deserved. But it was not to be. In training before the race, an collision with a cyclist led to an injury for which she had to take anti-inflammatory medication. The medicine depleted her system but she was determined to still race. However, her weakened body could not take the pace and she was forced to drop out of the race in tears. She later said the time that followed was 'traumatic' as she felt like she'd let the nation down and Gary admitted in ITV4's Sports Life Stories that the media attention almost led to him having 'a nervous breakdown'. The following year her success winning the London Marathon again was overshadowed by the fact she had to stop for a very public loo break on the side of the road. At the press conference afterwards, Paula laughed off the embarrassing incident explaining her need for the toilet was giving her stomach cramps and 'the main thing was to win the race'. Later that year, she won another gold medal in the World Championships over the marathon distance. Paula and Gary moved to Monaco and started a family as daughter Isla was born in January 2007. Less than a year later, Paula was back to winning ways taking victory at the New York Marathon. Daughter Isla was born in 2007 and months later, Paula won the New York marathon . But in 2008, she was disappointed to finish 23rd in the Beijing Olympics as her training was interrupted by injury in the build up. She's pictured here being consoled by friend and fellow GB runner Liz Yelling . Son Raphael was born in 2010 but injury again ruined her attempts to resume her running career . Once again she became an inspiration and proved to other elite female athletes that you can combine motherhood with a successful running career. In 2008, Paula lined up at the Olympics again but injury in the build-up to the race meant she missed vital training and she wasn't fit enough to compete with the best on the day. She finished in 23rd place and was once again upset she couldn't fulfill her potential at the Olympics. Later that year she won the New York marathon and then took another career break to have son Raphael. Since then, she returned to competitive running but was often thwarted by injury causing her to pull out of major competitions. In 2012, Paula had surgery on a long-standing foot problem in the hope it would mean she could run again . The surgery worked and Paula will now return to run the streets of London this weekend . The athlete said she's delighted to be back in the capital and Sunday's race will be 'really special' A foot problem meant running in the London 2012 Olympics was out of the question - in fact doctors were worried she may never run again. She kept up her interest in athletics becoming a commentator for the BBC and supporting grassroots running. Following surgery in 2012, she was relieved to be able to run again and is delighted she can now run the London Marathon again, albeit not at full fitness. She said of Sunday's race: 'I know I am not going to be competitive but to get the chance to take part in this race one more time is something that is really special.'","41-year-old mother-of-two has battled back from injury .

"For a player known for his fearsome, fire-breathing nature in the centre of Arsenal’s midfield, who would protect goal like it was a pot of gold, it is fitting that he is preparing to be a football manager at Dragon Park. Patrick Vieira is set to complete his UEFA Pro Licence this summer leaving Manchester City’s Head of the Elite Development equipped for the top job. He has been taking his coaching badges with the Welsh Football Association under their technical director Osian Roberts. Given Manuel Pellegrini’s capitulation at City, the timing of their conclusion could not be better with Vieira itching for a chance to test himself amongst the best. Patrick Vieira has been part of the coaching team at Manchester City since he retired . Vieira worked as Football Development Executive at City before becoming reserve team manager . Vieira is one of the potential candidates in the frame to replace Manuel Pellegrini - if he were to leave . Under Premier League rules, there is nothing stopping Vieira taking charge now as they allow coaches without the full qualifications to take charge for 12 weeks. There is currently no real hurry, but in the coming months City’s top echelons will have some important decisions to make. Vieira’s contract at City is due to expire this summer and he is not prepared to hang around forever waiting for a chance at the helm. City’s teenagers are in awe of the man, having grown up watching him torment the Premier League for a decade at Arsenal and City and across Europe. Vieira played for Manchester City towards the end of his career after spells at Juventus and Inter Milan . Vieira was signed by former manager Roberto Mancini in 2011 . One of their brightest prospects on loan at Lille, Rony Lopes, told Sportsmail in an interview: ’It was like a dream just to meet someone like Vieira. For him to be the coach, it was the best thing in the world. From the first day, he was always very friendly, talking to me a lot, trying to pass on his knowledge and make me grow up as a player and a person. That was he wanted. He is very important to me. He keeps in touch with me, asking how I am.’ After a poor start to his time in charge of City’s young players they have made it to the UEFA Youth League quarter-finals for two successive seasons, enhancing Vieira’s reputation. Young Portuguese player Rony Lopes spoke highly of Vieira . The Frenchman also has allies in the first team, having played with Vincent Kompany and Joe Hart in his one season at the club in 2010/11. When Vieira joined City in a coaching capacity in June 2013 his aim was to see how he progressed in ‘the next few years,’ suggesting he is coming to a decision-making juncture in his career. He chose the Welsh FA and Roberts, who works alongside his deputy Carl Darlington, to complete his badges because the pair are known for developing individual coaches through their personality. Vieira is best remembered for the nine years he spent at Arsenal . Vieira made his name in England at Arsenal where he won seven major honours . Vieira has his own idea of how he wants to manage a side. ‘My coaching style is a combination from my experience of working with Arsene Wenger, Fabio Capello and Jose Mourinho,’ he told Sportsmail in an interview. ‘There is a little bit of all of them, plus my own experience to deliver my message. The relationship with the players is so important. I want to trust them but they must trust me, too. I like it because I want to be close with them. ‘ . In February he added another stellar manager to his list of influences when he spent time at Bayern Munich with Pep Guardiola and his backroom staff. City’s academy director Mark Allen described how he likes his sides to play: ‘We play out from the back, through the thirds, into midfield and then a possession-based game but with fast, attacking play. We want to keep the ball, have full-backs bombing on and work on a very fast recovery. Press, press, press and play again.'","Patrick Vieira set to complete his UEFA Pro Licence this summer .

"A shrine created in memory of those killed during the Germanwings crash has revealed the first picture of the hero pilot who tried to break into the plane’s cockpit. Staring straight ahead, eyes firmly on the camera, this is the only photograph to have emerged of Patrick Sonderheimer, the pilot of the doomed flight. Yet the shrine, which was erected in memory of the staff killed during the tragedy, controversially also includes a picture of co-pilot Andreas Lubitz. Scroll down for video . A memorial display at Dusseldorf airport has revealed the first photograph of hero captain Patrick Sondheimer left) who tried to break down the cockpit door to stop killer pilot Andreas Lubitz (second from left) from crashing the aircraft . Mr Lubitz is the man who orchestrated the disaster by steering flight 9525, from Barcelona to Dusseldorf, into the mountains killing all of those on board. It has since emerged that Mr Lubitz had carefully planned the attack using the online pseudonym ‘Skydevil’, according to the German newspaper Bild. As the plane plummeted towards ground, Mr Sondheimer, 36, a father-of-two, tried in vain to save the lives of the 144 passengers and five crew members on board. Moments before, he had left the cockpit in the hands of his co-pilot in order to use the bathroom. When he returned, the door was locked and co-pilot Lubitz, 27, ignored desperate pleas from his colleague to let him back in. In a desperate attempt to stop the fatal crash, Mr Sondheimer spent up to five minutes attempting to smash his way into the cockpit using an axe. Mr Sondheimer used an axe to try to break down the door to the cockpit after Lubitz (right) locked him out before accelerating into a mountain . All of the 144 passengers and five crew members died in the crash. Lubitz, 27, had been plotting the disaster online under the name Skydevil . On recordings retrieved from the plane’s black box Mr Sondheimer can be heard shouting: ‘Open the goddam door’ in the moments before his death. The display in memory of the staff who died was created before it was revealed that Mr Lubitz had intentionally crashed the plane in the French Alps on March 24. Alongside the two men, sit the photographs of the other four crew members killed during the tragedy. All four are seen smiling broadly at the camera. The picture was taken at Dusseldorf airport, according to German newspaper Bild am Sonntag. Last night, Mr Sondheimer’s heartbroken mother paid tribute to her ‘hero’ son at her home 15 miles from the German town of Dusseldorf. Mrs Sondheimer said: ‘He died a hero but he still died, and we are devastated. The light has gone out of our lives. I am too upset to say any more.’ Shortly before the crash, Mr Sondheimer, the father of a six-year-old girl and a three-year-old boy, had switched from long-haul to short-haul flights in order to spend more time with his young family. During a memorial on March 29, his grandmother Marianne Sondheimer said her grandson’s lifelong dream was to become a pilot. She said: ‘My grandson is dead and all because of an idiot who did this to his whole flight and killed so many people.’ During the service, Captain Sondheimer was described as a man who ‘radiated happiness’. Black box recordings revealed Mr Sondheimer frantically appealed to Lubitz to open the door as the plane plunged further towards a mountain. He was described as a hero by his family .","Mr Sondheimer frantically tried to break down cockpit door before crash .

"Kingsley Burrell, 29, died in police custody on March 31 2011, four days after he was arrested and sectioned in Birmingham city centre . A mentally ill father-of-three who died in police custody was handcuffed for six hours, wet himself after being denied access to a toilet, and was repeatedly punched by officers, it was claimed today. Kingsley Burrell, 29, was taken into custody on March 27 2011 after calling police to say he was being threatened with a gun while out shopping in the centre of Birmingham, a court has heard. However, when CCTV showed that in fact nobody had approached him, he was sectioned under the Mental Health Act, and died four days later at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital (QE). An inquest into his death at Birmingham Coroner's Court heard that he was arrested in the Haymer corner shop in Winson Green while he was going swimming with his son, four, and niece. Trainee security guard Mr Burrell called police himself, saying two men had threatened to shoot him, but when they arrived he was handcuffed and taken to the QE hospital. Today, Kadisha Brown-Burrell, the victim's sister, described the moment she saw Mr Burrell following his arrest. She said: 'When he walked out he walked over stiff. He couldn’t move his head, couldn’t move his body, couldn’t move his shoulders. 'Kingsley had three lumps, one on his forehead. I said to Chantelle, ""Take a picture of that"". 'Kingsley said to me, ""I can’t move"". He couldn’t move the upper part of his body. He was barefoot and had pyjama bottoms on. 'I could see that he was really upset, saying, ""How can they put me in here knowing I was calling for help because there were a couple of guys after me?""' When she and Mr Burrell's partner Chantelle Graham returned to see him the following day, he told them he had been handcuffed for a number of hours after being taken to the hospital. Ms Brown-Burrell said: 'He said that while he was in the QE during assessment he was on the floor, and all he wanted was a glass of water. Mr Burrell was taken into custody after calling officers and claiming three men had threatened him with a machine gun. When CCTV showed that nobody had approached Mr Burrell, he was sectioned . Today an inquest into Mr Burrell's death was told his claims that police beat him, and left him handcuffed for six hours  pictured left to right, his family Janet Burrell, Lorraine Burell and Kadisha Burrell) 'They had made him incontinent and he had wet himself. He was on the floor for five or six hours and all he wanted was water and for them to release the cuffs.' Mr Burrell told her a police officer had offered to loosen the cuffs for him, but 'instead he tightened them', she told the court. Mr Burrell also told her he had been involved in a struggle in the back of the ambulance, and that three members of hospital staff had watched while police officers 'injected me into my brain'. She said: 'When I went to see Kingsley he said the police gave him injections into the top of his head, while three mental health staff looked through a window.' Ms Brown-Burrell described her brother, as 'calm, collected and outgoing', but said that he had been worried about a paternity issue with an ex-girlfriend. The woman, Charmaine Clarke, had been claiming that her son was not Mr Burrell's, and had named the child after another man. The inquest heard that Mr Burrell had been trying to get his former partner to take a DNA test to confirm whether he was the father. Mr Burrell believed that the two men had come into the shop to threaten him over the issue, adding that the only reason he wasn't shot was because he had his son with him . Mr Burrell's sister Kadisha (front right) also told the inquest her brother's allegations that police had left him without access to a toilet so he had wet himself . Among Mr Burrell's other allegations, related to the court by his sister and former partner, were that police had kept him in uncomfortably tight handcuffs, and had injected him three times in the head . In a 999 call played to the jury Mr Burrell repeatedly said that 'two black youths and one Asian' put a 'Mach 10' machine gun to his head, and were waiting for him outside the shop. Mr Burrell also claimed that one of the men was the leader of the Burger Bar Crew, a notorious Birmingham gang. But CCTV footage played to the court showed no sign of armed men in the shop. Instead all it showed was Mr Brown looking agitated and gesticulating wildly near the counter. Andy Gillespie, a firefighter who was one of the first on the scene, said Mr Burrell was 'very distressed', struggled to make eye contact was gesticulating and animated while on the phone. In a previous statement Mr Gillespie said that when he approached Mr Burrell he told him he was a 'f****** dead man', adding: 'Two people are trying to kill me. I will be dead in 24 hours.' He said Mr Burrell told him: 'I want everyone here for protection, I am a dead man. Somebody put a gun to my head, there is guys down the road, I am a dead man.' Footage showed Mr Burrell repeatedly pressing his hands together in prayer, and Mr Gillespie said he was saying: 'Praise God, praise Allah'. He said: 'It was almost that he felt relieved that he hadn't been shot.' Kadisha Brown-Burrell (pictured) said that on the first day she went to visit her brother in hospital, after he was arrested, he was 'walking stiff' and couldn't move the upper part of his body . Mr Burrell's partner, Chantelle Graham, said her son, who was with Mr Burrell as he was arrested, repeated 'the black police officer hit my daddy' after she took him home . Ms Graham told the inquest that when she went to pick up her son from a police station an officer told her Mr Burrell had 'gone berserk' in the ambulance . The officer alleged that Mr Burrell had banged his son's head against the wall and that he had to be restrained in order to get the boy away from him. But her son told her a black police officer had started hitting Mr Burrell, the court heard. Ms Graham said: 'Kayden just kept saying, ""The black police officer hit my daddy"" to anyone who would listen. That is what he told everyone, even at school.' Ms Brown-Burrell also said that in the days after Mr Burrell's death, Kayden had said, 'The naughty black policeman did that to daddy.' The inquest also heard that Mr Burrell had been carrying a CS canister on the day he was detained, as well as claims that he was a gang member and drug dealer. The inquest continues tomorrow and is expected to last six weeks.

"When Hillary Clinton steps off her road-trip van on Tuesday at a rural Iowa community college, she might not be greeted by cheering throngs. Daily Mail Online spoke to students at Kirkwood Community College's regional center in Jones County, where the former secretary of state will hold her first low-key campaign event. The outlook isn't sunny for the kickoff of her 'listening tour': Of the ten students interviewed in the school's public lounge, only two would speak kindly of Mrs. Clinton. 'She's going to push some emotional thing on us,' predicted student Hallie Corum in between classes. 'What else is she supposed to do?' 'She's going to be, like, talking s**t.' 'TALKING S**T': Hillary Clinton launched her presidential campaign on Sunday and hit the road in a van, en route to a skeptical bunch of community college students in Monticello, Iowa . Corey Jones said he suspects that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama want immigration reform because it would result in a new generation of grateful Democratic voters – and he plans to ask her about it on Tuesday . Kirkwood Community College's outpost in rural Monticello serves hundreds of students, including some who are still high school juniors and seniors . Corum declined to be photographed, flashing an impish grin. Corey Jones, a graphic design student, is among those chosen to question Mrs. Clinton in a roundtable setting on Tuesday. He said his teachers chose him to join a group of 'from 6 to 8' students whowill participate because 'I pay attention to politics,' something his friends around a table agreed with. 'I didn't know Hillary Clinton was running,' one young woman said. 'Is she running? Go ask Corey. He's up on all that stuff.' Jones said he plans to ask Hillary about illegal immigration. 'It's – well, Immigration reform,' he told Daily Mail Online. 'You know, Obama's plan was to make the illegal immigrants legal.' 'She's part of all that. And some people think – well, I think maybe – it's just a tactic to have more Democratic votes' from millions of grateful new citizens. Jones, like Corum, will vote in his first presidential election next year. He said Clinton is holding her first campaign event at a community college 'because she's trying to appeal to youth, to young voters.' 'She announced it on YouTube. That's targeted at people my age, right?' Clinton set off on a 1,000-mile road trip Sunday in her home town of Chappaqua, New York, and headed to Iowa – where the nation's first primary caucuses will start the machinery that chooses major parties' presidential candidate. She announced Sunday afternoon that she was officially in the race. A female student who declined to be named speculated about Clinton's motives for taking ground transportation instead of a jet aircraft. 'Can you imagine if she stepped off a private jet in Des Moines or Iowa City and walked down a set of steps in realy expensive shoes and a thousand-dollar outfit?' she asked. 'That would be, um, a really bad idea. I like the van better. Is it a minivan? God, I hope it's not a minivan.' Future chef Ross Vander Peut said gay marriage is a 'deal-breaker' for him but worries that Hillary Clinton 'seems like, kinda like a control freak' Monticello, Iowa is a sleepy farm town whose main street is lined with shops sporting signs that look like relics from the mid-twentieth century . Most students in Monday's random sample chose not to talk about Mrs. Clinton. All of the will be old enough to vote next year for the first time in their lives. Three said they didn't have an opinion about the Democratic front-runner. One looked up, shook her head, and put a pair of earbuds on. Two more said they would rather remain silent. 'You know, it's that ""If you don't have something nice to say, don't say anything at all"" deal,' a young woman offered from behind her tablet computer. Moments later a group of young men walked down a hallway mimicking Bill Clinton's infamous 'I did not have sexual relations with that woman' press conference – and laughing uproariously. One who would talk is Bri Parks, a speech and psychology student who wants to be an FBI profiler because she likes 'trying to figure out how the human brain works.' Clinton can work to earn her vote, Parks said. 'If I heard her opinions and liked her ideas, I would support her.' But 'I hope people don't vote for her just because she's a woman.' Asked for the nicest thing she could say about Mrs. Clinton, Parks said 'she's not going at this saying, ""Look, I'm a woman, so vote for me."" She's not using her sex to prove a point.' 'She's looking at herself as a politician, not as a woman.' Students like these gathered in a Kirkwood Community College lounge and spoke with Daily Mail Online before and after classes on Monday . Bri Parks, a Kirkwood Community College student, said she hopes Americans don't vote for Hillary Clinton 'just because she's a woman' 'I don't think we should be putting people in extremely high political positions because of race, sex, or whatever,' Parks explained. 'Then you're doing things just because of what people look like.' Kirkwood serves between 22,000 and 26,000 students taking college-credit courses at sites in seven Iowa counties, according to a school official. The Monticello outpost is canceling many classes on Tuesday, making some students scratch their heads since 'this is the smallest part of Kirkwood,' as one pointed out. 'They could have had it somewhere else.' As it is, Kirkwood's students who do have class will have to dodge Secret Service agents and TV news cameras to get through the lobby. Some of them are recent high school graduates while others are finishing their 11th- and 12th-grade years collecting college credits one day per week. Ross Vander Peut, a self-described future chef, is one of the youngest. He's 16, a high-school junior, but will turn 18 just before the election. Vander Peut described himself as a libertarian – 'I like government to leave me alone,' he said – and gay marriage is 'a deal-breaker.' 'Equal rights, homosexual rights, it's one thing I will not sway on,' he told Daily Mail Online. 'If you are against gay marriage, you've lost my vote. There's nothing you can do to change it.' He hedged on Hillary, saying she 'seems like, kinda like a control freak.' 'But she also seems very strong-willed and determined. When she wants something done she probably does it herself.'","Daily Mail Online spoke to ten students at Kirkwood Community College's satellite campus in rural Iowa where Hillary Clinton will be Tuesday .

"(CNN)A fiery sunset greeted people in Washington Sunday. The deep reddish color caught Seattle native Tim Durkan's eye. He photographed a handful of aerial shots of the sunset warming the city's skyline and shared them on CNN iReport. The stunning sunsets were the result of raging wildfires in parts of Siberia. ""The dramatic sunsets began showing up over the weekend and had Seattle locals wondering where the amber-colored haze was originating from,"" Durken said. The fires were started in southeastern Siberia, by farmers burning grass in their fields. But on April 14, it is believed that the flames quickly grew out of control because of strong winds and spread throughout the region, according to CNN affiliate KOMO-TV. As a result, the fires have destroyed dozens of villages in the region. Rescue crews were able to put out the flames. However, the lingering smoke from the widespread fires were picked up by atmospheric winds. The winds carried the smoke from Siberia across the Pacific Ocean and brought it to the Pacific Northwest. Parts of Oregon, Washington and British Columbia are seeing the results of the smoke, wind and solar light combination. The reason people are seeing an intense red sunset is a result of smoke particles filtering out the shorter wavelength colors from the sunlight like greens, blues, yellows and purples, KOMO-TV said. That means colors like red and orange are able to penetrate the air unfiltered. The colors are especially intense during sunrises and sunsets because there is more atmosphere for the light to travel through to get to a person's eye. As the smoke starts to dissipate, air quality will get better and these fiery sunsets will lose their reddish hue.","Smoke from massive fires in Siberia created fiery sunsets in the Pacific Northwest .

"(The Hollywood Reporter)Richard Dysart, the Emmy-winning actor who portrayed the cranky senior partner Leland McKenzie in the slick, long-running NBC drama ""L.A. Law,"" has died. He was 86. Dysart, who also played Coach in the original 1972 Broadway production of Jason Miller's Pulitzer Prize-winning ""That Championship Season,"" died Sunday at home in Santa Monica after a long illness, his wife, artist Kathryn Jacobi, told The Hollywood Reporter. The acclaimed ""L.A. Law"" — created by Steven Bochco (who eventually handed off the series to David E. Kelley) and Terry Louise Fisher — aired for eight seasons from 1986 to 1994. For playing the founder of the firm McKenzie, Brackman, Chaney and Kuzak, Dysart was nominated for the Emmy for outstanding supporting actor in a drama series for four straight years, finally winning the trophy in 1992. ""I always had him in mind for that role,"" Bochco said in a 2002 interview with the Archive of American Television. ""He's so avuncular. So I reached out to him. You know, Dick is sort of an old hippie. So he went into his closet and tried to find a lawyer outfit, and he came to meet us wearing a suit and tie. He was perfect."" ""We got together, mapped out the character's past to give us a basis from which to work, and it's all gone smoothly since then,"" Dysart said in a 1990 interview with The Seattle Times. ""Sometimes I worry — it's all been going too well — a role I love to play in a series that's about as good as you can get. Something's wrong!"" Perhaps Dysart's most memorable character arc on the show was when he was found in bed with power-hungry competitor Rosalind Shays (played by Diana Muldaur). He was one of the few actors to appear in every episode. Dysart's range of authority -figure parts ran right to the top. He limned Harry Truman in the CBS telefilm ""Day One"" and in the ABC miniseries ""War and Remembrance,"" both of which aired in 1989, and he was Henry L. Stimson, the 33rd U.S. president's Secretary of War, in the 1995 HBO telefilm ""Truman,"" starring Gary Sinise. Similarly, he played the Secretary of Defense in ""Meteor"" (1979). Hollywood Reporter: Most powerful people in N.Y. media . Dysart also performed extensively in the medical- (movie) field, performing enough doctor roles to, perhaps, qualify to practice. His two most memorable came in classic satires: in Paddy Chayevsky's scathing ""The Hospital"" (1971), starring George C. Scott (a good friend), and in ""Being There"" (1979), as Melvyn Douglas' doctor. He also was a doctor who died a gruesome death in John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" (1982) and a physician in such films as ""The Terminal Man"" (1974), ""The Falcon and the Snowman"" (1985) and ""Warning Sign"" (1985). Dysart portrayed J. Edgar Hoover in the 1993 USA telefilm ""Marilyn & Bobby: Her Final Affair"" and in Mario Van Peebles' ""Panther"" (1995). Dysart also excelled as cranky coots and shifty sorts. He portrayed a motel receptionist in Richard Lester's ""Petulia"" (1968); was the bad guy who battled Clint Eastwood in ""Pale Rider"" (1985); stood out as a power player in Oliver Stone's ""Wall Street"" (1987); and sold barbwire in ""Back to the Future III"" (1990). Dysart was born March 30, 1929, in Boston and raised in Maine. Following high school, he attended the Gould Academy in Bethel, Maine, for a year, served in the U.S. Air Force and attended Emerson College, where he graduated with a master's degree in speech communications. At the time, he was interested in a career in radio (he became fascinated with the medium in first grade, when he was bedridden for a year because of rheumatic fever) but was soon tempted by acting. He moved to New York on a whim and was able to land minor roles on TV and a part in an off-Broadway production of ""The Iceman Cometh"" opposite Jason Robards. In the mid-1960s, he joined the American Conservatory Theater and toured the country doing plays, then landed roles on Broadway in ""All in Good Time,"" ""The Little Foxes"" and ""A Place Without Doors."" He received a Drama Desk Award for his performance in ""That Championship Season."" Hollywood Reporter: Q&A with Liz Smith . Dysart's credits include an eclectic array of movies, including ""The Crazy World of Julius Vrooder"" (1974), ""The Day of the Locust"" (1975), ""The Hindenburg"" (1975), ""An Enemy of the People"" (1978), ""Prophecy"" (1979), ""Mask"" (1985) and ""Hard Rain"" (1998). On television, he was top-notch in the telefilms ""The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman"" (1974), ""The People vs. Jean Harris"" (1981), as Dwight D. Eisenhower in ""The Last Days of Patton"" (1986) and as studio chief Louis B. Mayer in ""Malice in Wonderland"" (1985). Survivors also include his stepson Arie and daughter-in-law Jeannine Jacobi, mother-in-law Lenore, brother and sister-in-law Nadine and John Jacobi and grandchildren Abby and Levi. A private memorial is being planned. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations be made to the Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum, an outdoor theater in Topanga Canyon in the Los Angeles area. Dysart and Jacobi had a second home in the forests of British Columbia. He was lured out of retirement for his last onscreen appearance, the ""L.A. Law"" reunion telefilm of 2002. ""They remain timely, with cases about points of law that are still current,"" he said of watching ""L.A. Law"" reruns in a 2002 interview with The Bangor Daily News.

"This gruesome video shows how a man popped a huge cyst in his arm with a needle, screwdriver and a pair of pliers. The man, known only as Jason, from Vancouver, uploaded the clip to YouTube after his wife filmed the stomach-churning moment. It begins with him explaining exactly how he will pop the grape-sized growth on his wrist. He says: 'We have the pliers, they're going to hold onto the needle which will then be smashed into my cyst with the end of a screwdriver. 'It should be pretty cool.' The man, known only as Jason, uploaded the video to YouTube of his unique way of popping a cyst - using a needle, a pair of pliers and a screwdriver. Pictured is his sister in law putting the needle into the swelling . As Jason's sister in law hammers the needle deeper into the cyst with the handle of a screwdriver, he emits loud cries of pain . First, he lays his left arm down on some kitchen roll on a table so the lump is easily accessible. His sister-in-law then inserts the needle into the cyst and holds it in place with a pair of pliers as he winces. She then begins the horrifying process of hammering the needle deeper into the growth. Sharp cries of pain are heard from Jason with each hit. Astonishingly, though the process seems too agonising to bear, Jason says: 'I think we can go a little deeper'. After one last hammer – which was once again met with a loud moan – he says: 'It's in there pretty good. Now we've got to pull it out. Dr Arun Ghosh, a private GP in Liverpool, condemned Jason's method of popping his cyst with a needle, pliers and a screwdriver. He told MailOnline: 'We advise not draining minor ganglions. 'They just get bigger and bigger. We only drain it if they are very large and hindering the use of the hand. 'It’s wrong to pop a ganglion with a needle and a screwdriver on so many levels. Traditionally, ganglions would be 'bashed with the family bible', but doctors do not advise this . 'From a hygiene point of view you’ve got to sterilise your equipment. We would never insert a needle that would be used in the house. They are covered in millions of bacteria. 'You can never control the force by using a screwdriver, and that’s dangerous. 'There are very fine arteries and nerves in the hand, and they’re so easy to damage. 'If they are damaged you get irreversible pain. If you think how often you use your hand that can be debilitating. 'There used to be a myth that you should bash a ganglion with a family bible to burst it. 'That’s caused problems with the fluid going into the wrist joint, causing carpel tunnel syndrome: swelling inside the wrist. 'If we did treat it, we’d do a needle aspiration, which means sucking out the glue-like pus. 'But that would be what is known as ""aseptic"", meaning the pus would be drawn out into the syringe and would never touch the wound, to prevent infection. 'We would also do it under ultrasound so as not to damage the fine veins and arteries in the hand. 'If you have a ganglion or a swelling you must go to your GP and they will advise whether its OK or whether it’s best to be left alone. 'Then it will be followed up and receive proper after care.' 'I'm going to see if we can get the fluid squirting out if it does.' Moments later, he takes the needle out and asks the camera to zoom in on his arm. As he squeezes the cyst, sticky, translucent jelly comes rushing out and gathers in a pea-sized ball. 'Let's see what the consistency looks like,' he said as he rubs the gluey substance between two fingers. He adds: 'This is probably the grossest thing I've ever seen – since the last time I've done this. 'This will probably do the trick for three or so months until I have to pop it again.' Uploading the video to YouTube under the name 'The Wrist Cyst', he promises to upload another video in another three months time when he pops the cyst again. Unsurprisingly, medical professionals do not advise using Jason's method to treat lumps found on the body. Dr Arun Ghosh, a private GP in Liverpool, explains that Jason's cyst is a ganglion, a fluid-filled swelling that develops near a joint or a tendon. They are made up of a thick jelly-like fluid called synovial fluid, which surrounds joints and tendons to lubricate them during movement - and occur when this fluid leaks out and collects under the skin. Ganglions can occur alongside any joint in the body, but are most commonly found on the wrist, hand and fingers. Generally harmless, if they do not cause any pain, they can be left alone and will disappear without any treatment. Dr Ghosh said: 'We advise not draining minor ganglions. They just get bigger and bigger. We only drain it if they are very large and hindering the use of the hand. 'A ganglion is a fluid-filled sack. If you start the drainage process, the bigger and bigger the sack will fill. 'This is the issue this gentleman has caused, he’ll need to drain it more often.' Traditionally, ganglions were treated by being 'bashed with the family Bible', but this is no longer recommended, as this could cause the fluid to disperse and cause carpel tunnel syndrome - a swelling in the wrist - he added. Dr Ghosh added Jason's method was also not advisable either. He told MailOnline: 'It’s wrong to pop a ganglion with a needle and a screwdriver on so many levels. It’s unhygienic, you can’t control the force and you could damage the nerves in the hand. 'From a hygiene point of view you’ve got to sterilise your equipment. We would never insert a needle that would be used in the house. They are covered in millions of bacteria. 'You can never control the force by using a screwdriver, and that’s dangerous. 'There are very fine arteries and nerves in the hand, and they’re so easy to damage. If they are damaged you get irreversible pain. If you think how often you use your hand that can be debilitating.' He removes the needle and squeezes the cyst, and a ball of sticky, see-through jelly-like fluid emerges . Jason rubs his fingers together to show the sticky consistency of the fluid that comes out of the growth, which doctors explain is synovial fluid, which surrounds joints and tendons to lubricate them . At the end of the video, Jason says the cyst will need draining again in three months. But doctors strongly advise against his method - and say ganglions do not normally require treatment . If the cyst needs treatment, the fluid should be drained out with a needle and syringe by a doctor, or cut out in a surgical procedure. Dr Ghosh added: 'If we did treat it, we’d do a needle aspiration, which means sucking out the glue-like pus. 'But that would be what is known as ""aseptic"", meaning the pus would be drawn out into the syringe and would never touch the wound, to prevent infection. 'We would also do it under ultrasound so as not to damage the fine veins and arteries in the hand. 'If you have a ganglion or a swelling you must go to your GP and they will advise whether its OK or whether it’s best to be left alone. 'Then it will be followed up and receive proper after care.'","The man, known only as Jason, is filmed popping the ganglion on his wrist .

"Manchester City have decided to listen to offers for Yaya Toure and Samir Nasri this summer as the Barclays Premier League champions look to repair the damage of a disastrous title defence. City manager Manuel Pellegrini is under intense scrutiny following Sunday’s 4-2 defeat by neighbours Manchester United. But as the City board refuse to give up on their manager just yet the decision has been made to jettison high-profile players who the club believe have failed them. Manchester City have decided to listen to offers for Ivorian midfielder Yaya Toure this summer . The Premier League champions are also open to allowing Samir Nasri leave the Etihad Stadium . Toure will be made available before his value in the market dwindles. Nasri, meanwhile, has barely played since his lame showing in the Champions League at Barcelona. Defender Aleksandar Kolarov and striker Edin Dzeko are also short of admirers within the club, while midfielder James Milner is out of contract this summer. Toure may be difficult to sell as he earns in excess of £1million a month. Pellegrini is vulnerable but may be saved by a relatively undemanding fixture list up to the end of the season and by the fact that City’s No 1 choice to replace him, Pep Guardiola, is contracted to Bayern Munich for another year. However, City fear captain Vincent Kompany will miss a few weeks of the run-in with a thigh injury.","Manchester City were beaten 4-2 by their rivals United at Old Trafford .

"Two former police officials who quit their jobs in Parma, Missouri, have revealed what they say are the real reasons they stepped down. A black woman, Tyus Byrd,  was recently elected mayor of the town over the white incumbent candidate Randall Ramsey, MailOnline reported earlier this week. Six city officials quit their jobs shortly after Byrd won, according to multiple reports. Two of those individuals - Trish Cohen, Parma's former police chief, and Rich Medley, the town's former assistant police chief - recently spoke to NBC News. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Trish Cohen, Parma's former police chief, and Rich Medley, the town's former assistant police chief,  quit their jobs with the city. Tyus Byrd, who is black, was recently elected mayor. Cohen has said she and Medley feared for their safety, and their home addresses had been shared online by Byrd's family members . Cohen alleged in the interview with the news outlet that she and Medley feared for their safety, and said their home addresses had been shared online by Byrd's family members. Referring to Byrd, Cohen told NBC News 'You can't have an anti-police mayor, and that's the way she made me feel.' 'My decision was not, did not, come lightly. At all,' Cohen also said. 'It has nothing to do with race. If it had anything to do with race, I'd done never went to work in the town.' Medley told NBC News 'From the moment [Byrd] announced her candidacy, she never approached any of us, never advised us what her plans were or anything. Never asked us to stay or told us that the moment she took office that we weren't going to have a job. 'We were in the dark on it, and then in hearing from her supporters that she was going to fire all of us, might as well start looking for something else.' Mayor: Tyus Byrd, pictured, has said she doesn't know what the 'safety issues' were and that she 'never said anything about cleaning house' Six city officials quit their jobs shortly after Byrd was elected to serve as Parma's mayor . Byrd, meanwhile, told NBC News she did not know the reason the city employees quit. She also told the news outlet she did not believe race played a role. In an interview with the media outlet, Byrd said 'It was cited to me that it was safety issues. I would love to know what those safety issues are. 'I wish we could have sat down and came to whatever the reasons were, that maybe we could have came to some type of agreement and understanding.' Speaking to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Byrd said 'I don’t understand. I never said anything about cleaning house.' The newspaper reported that while speaking to the Post-Dispatch, 'Medley acknowledged that Byrd had never threatened to fire officers, nor publicly indicated that she would interfere with police.' Medley told Daily Mail Online on Thursday, referring to the remarks Byrd earlier made to NBC News about wanting to have discussed issues together, 'She never made any attempts to talk with us during her candidacy or after winning the election. It's very hard to believe someone truly wanted to work with the police department in regards to their concerns when no effort is made. 'Add to that the information we were receiving from her supporters about firing us when she took office. It's not hard to understand that we did not believe we would have jobs after April 14th at 5p.m.' Cohen did not respond to a message seeking comment on social media Wednesday, and on Thursday her Facebook page appeared to have been taken down. Byrd did not respond to a request for comment on social media Wednesday, and did not immediately return requests on Thursday. A phone number listed for the town's city hall on its website appeared to in fact be a fax number when dialed by a reporter.","Tyus Byrd, who is black, was recently elected mayor of Parma, Missouri .

"Hillary Clinton has garnered one of her first major endorsements in run bid for the White House: The nation's largest lesbian political action committee. The group, LPAC, launched Lesbians4Hillary on Monday to support the former First Lady's bid to become the nation's first female president.

I am honored to join LPAC and help lead our effort to elect Hillary Clinton in 2016.' King, who was outed as a lesbian in 1981, was a leader of the group 'Women for Hillary' in 2008, as well. The video in which Hillary announced she was running for president included a clip of a lesbian couple . The Twitter handle for the new group is @lezs4hillary . Many gays and lesbians point to Clinton's 2011 speech in Switzerland as Secretary of State in which she declared: 'Human rights are gay rights and gay rights are human rights.' In the video released yesterday announcing Clinton's candidacy for president, two gay couples were included. Among them, two lesbians who look lovingly into each other's eyes. However, in her 2008 campaign, Clinton did not support gay marriage. It took her five years - to publicly say that she supported gay marriage. President Barack Obama publicly announced his support for gay marriage nearly a year earlier in March 2012. The Economist called Clinton's stance on gay marriage, 'cautious to the point of cowardice.' 'It is not convincing to argue, as her supporters do, that she is only free to make her views known now that she has stepped down as America's chief diplomat. Her successor at the State Department, John Kerry, and has not been stoned as a blasphemer on any of his stops around the world to date,' the magazine's US columnist wrote. Critics also point out that as First Lady, she did not oppose her husband signing 'Don't Ask Don't Tell,' which banned being openly gay in the military or the Defense of Marriage Act, which banned gay marriage at the federal level.","LPAC, a pro-LGBT Super PAC, launched Lesbians4Hillary on Monday .

"Under pressure Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola has revealed that 'only the treble is enough' for his team as they attempt to overturn their 3-1 deficit against Porto in the Champions League. Bayern host the Portuguese side on Tuesday and Guardiola is confident the Bundesliga leaders will emerge victorious. 'I am completely convinced that my players will take their chances,' Guardiola said. 'I know which club I am at and know that (league) champions and cup winners is not enough. Only the treble is enough.' Pep Guardiola is targeting winning  three trophies with Bayern Munich this season .

Philipp Lahm will look to lead his team into the semi-final of the Champions League on Tuesday . Bayern remain on course for three trophies, leading the Bundesliga by 12 points and will meet Borussia Dortmund in the German Cup semi-final. The Bavarians won the treble under then coach Jupp Heynckes in 2013, just before Guardiola took over. The current Bayern boss also won the treble with Barcelona in 2009, when they became the first Spanish club to win the domestic league and cup as well as the Champions League in the same season. Ahead of the visit of Porto, Guardiola said on Monday that France winger Franck Ribery is highly unlikely to recover from an ankle injury in time to feature for Bayern. Ribery has been out for more than a month and Guardiola said it was more likely the player would miss the second leg of the quarter-final in Munich as the Germans look to recover from a stunning 3-1 defeat in Portugal last week. 'I do not think that Franck can play,' Guardiola told reporters. 'I will speak with the our doctor but my feeling is that he can't make it.' Guardiola's hopes of turning the tie around have been hampered by a string of injury absences, including to key players Arjen Robben, David Alaba, Javi Martinez and Medhi Benatia. Bastian Schweinsteiger is also fighting to get fit in time for the game and Guardiola said the Germany captain would train with the team late on Monday for the first time.

The Spaniard, who wore a T-shirt made by the family of an Argentine journalist killed in a car crash at last year's World Cup, said his team would try everything to overturn the first leg deficit despite the injury problems. 'It makes no sense to be on the pitch if you don't want to turn it around. We want to turn it around,' he said.","Porto beat Bayern Munich 3-1 in Champions League quarter-final first leg .

"Despite Arsenal winning their eighth Premier League game in a row on Saturday, the club's chief executive Ivan Gazidis says he is 'not happy' that the club are not going to win the title. With top spot set to elude Arsenal again, Gazidis says the club will 'keep pushing' Chelsea, but he admitted winning the championship is unlikely.

"A 33-year-old professional skydiver who has made more than 6,000 dives was killed during a dive in Florida on Wednesday, after her chute apparently collided with another mid-air. Jessica Edgeington, of Villa Rica, Georgia, was a skilled diver known for a type of high-speed sport called 'swooping', where divers speed down to land and sweep over buoys and other obstacles on the surface of a pond as competition. She died after plummeting to the ground at the Skydive DeLand in DeLand, Florida. It is the second death at the skydiving center this year, after Navy SEAL William Marston died after landing heavily in January. It is unclear what type of dive Edgeinton was maneuvering, but she appears to have run into a problem in the air. First responders arrived about 4.10pm and Edgeington was pronounced dead at the scene. Tragedy: Jessica Edgeington, 33, a professional skydiver, was killed in a dive on Wednesday in DeLand, Florida, after apparently colliding with another dive mid-air . Professional: Edgeington had made over 6,000 jumps and competed in a sport called 'swooping', where divers speed down to land and swoop over buoys and other obstacles on the surface of a pond as competition . Investigation: It is unclear what type of dive Edgeinton was maneuvering, but she appears to have run into a problem in the air, but the crash is under investigation . Scene: Edgeington was pronounced dead at DeLand Municipal Airport on Wednesday about 4.10pm . Local media reports say Edgeington collided with another diver, causing a problem with her parachute. However the crash is currently under investigation. According to The Tampa Bay Times,  'swoopers' like Edgeington jump from the plane at 5,000 feet and reach speeds of 90 miles per hour as they descend. The sport is about how the person can handle their parachute and make maneuvers, including turns and twists. Edgeington gave an interview with the Associated Press in May last year while competing for a spot on the U.S. Parachute Team. 'It's not necessarily scary to jump out of the plane anymore,' she said. Killed: Jessica Edgeington, seen here at a swooping course,  died Wednesday afternoon after flying out of Skydive DeLand in Florida on Wednesday . Edgeington continued in the interview: 'I get competition nerves when I'm at something like this. 'So that's probably the most nerve wracking thing, is getting ready to compete. 'Trying to perform and do your best. Hopefully not mess up.' On her Facebook page, Edgeington lists herself as a 'canopy coach' for PD Factory Team. Canopy coaches educate skydivers of every level, from beginners working on accuracy to advanced semi-pros and elite military personnel. Her page was inundated with messages from family, friends and colleagues following the tragedy on Wednesday. Crash: Jessica Edgeington, 33, of Villa Rica, Georgia, died Wednesday afternoon at Skydive DeLand . It is the second death at the the DeLand field this year. In January, William 'Blake' Marston, a Navy SEAL learning how to skydive, died after hitting the land too hard, according to My News 13. The field is at DeLand Municipal Airport. Tributes: Hundreds of tributes have flooded in for the skydiver, describing her as a 'wonderful soul' Two other men died in separate incidents at Skydive DeLand in 2013. That year, in the 3.2 million jumps that happened across the country, the United States Parachute Associated recorded a total of 24 fatal skydiving accidents. There are thousands of dives at Skydive Delandeach year. It is also the home of SkyDive University, a professional skydiving instruction and coaching organization.","Jessica Edgeington, 33, had made over 6,000 jumps .

"A New York woman has worn the same ensemble to work every day for three years. Matilda Kahl, an art director at Saatchi & Saatchi, wears the exact same ‘uniform’ – an outfit made up of black trousers, white shirt and a custom leather rosette – every single day because, as she explains to DailyMail.com: 'When at work, I want to be judged on my work and my work only.' In an article for Harper's Bazaar, Matilda explained that the unique sartorial idea came to her after a particularly stressful morning when, with 'a fairly important meeting on the horizon' she began trying on a variety outfits to no satisfaction. Scroll down for video . Empowering: Saatchi & Saatchi art director Matilda Kahl has got everyone talking about her everyday work 'uniform' 'I'm given complete freedom over what I wear to the office, but that still left me questioning each piece that I added or subtracted from my outfit,' she wrote. '[I kept thinking], ""Is this too formal? Is that too out there? Is this dress too short?"" I finally chose something I regretted as soon as I hit the subway platform.' Arriving at her meeting late, frazzled and wearing an inside-out sweater, while her male colleagues and new boss looked relaxed and at-ease, left her feeling frustrated and wondering why she'd bothered with the stress of it at all. 'I knew my male colleagues were taken seriously no matter what they wore - and I highly doubted they put in as much sartorial time and effort as I had,' she writes. 'But gender issues aside, I needed to come up with a solution to simplify this morning struggle.' Vowing to never let herself feel that way again, Matilda made the decision to make the same simple, easy wardrobe choices as many of her male colleagues did, wearing the same outfit each and every day, thereby eliminating the seemingly endless struggle to determine what to wear. Simple, yet effective: Matilda achieved her look by buying blouses in bulk and pairing them only with black trousers . She found her sartorial salvation in the form of 15 identical white silk blouses and several pairs of simple black trousers. For a 'personal touch' she added a custom-made leather rosette in homage to her mother, who used to love putting bows in her hair. She also throws on a black blazer for the chillier days. 'I’ve always thought black and white looks stylish, so it was a pretty easy decision on the color,' she explains to Daily Mail Online, adding that she took her time deciding on the exact designs. 'I finally fell for the white shirt for its diagonal button line and the cuts in the sleeves. 'New York gets really hot in the summer, so as an alternative to the 6 pants I bought 2 matte black skirts. Simple and sweet.' With her identical every day look, Matilda is following in the footsteps of many high-powered individuals, from Steve Jobs to Mark Zuckerberg - who says he owns 20 identical grey t-shirts for work. All tied up: Matilda tops off her look with a simple black leather bow, which she calls her 'personal touch' inspired by her mother's affinity for bows in her hair . But despite many people trying out the trend before her, Matilda admitted that she faced 'mixed reactions' to her new uniform idea from her co-workers. She was asked if she had lost a bet, joined a cult and some even assumed she was too destitute to afford other work clothing. But when confronted with endless questions about her new look, she shot back with: 'Have you ever set up a bill for online auto-pay? Did it feel good to have one less thing to deal with every month?' Many critics also wonder: why doesn't she just choose her outfit the night before? 'To me, that would only move the problem to another time of day, not really solving it,' she says. 'It would just make me go to bed later and lose valuable sleep. 'Nor would it solve the pressure of constantly feeling that I have to express my creative ability through my way of dressing, which is something I feel relieved from now with the uniform.' According to Matilda, the criticism has done nothing but reassure her of her choices. 'People have really put it to the test, and I’m happy to say the more questions I get the more sure I become of that I’m happy with my choice of wearing a uniform,' she explains. All in all, Matilda is immensely pleased with her decision, saying it has saved her huge amounts of money– and also removed a source of stress from her life completely. She also claims it has given her a new sense of control. Coming up to three years in her look, Matilda doesn't see herself stopping anytime soon - but insists that if the mood strikes her, she could go back to planning her daily wardrobe. 'I still feel like it does a good job for me so I see no reason for stopping wearing the uniform,' she says. 'But if I would wake up one day and feel like start spending time on picking out an outfit every morning, I’d no problem with giving it up. The uniform is here for me, I’m not here for the uniform.' She does however admit that she has had to re-stock her collection of white shirts - because the 15 that she bought originally have become so worn out that she is no longer able to wear them. 'They are all exactly the same and have been for almost three years, up until a week ago,' she added to Harper's Bazaar. 'The shirts had gotten worn out, others stained....So last weekend I spent two days on a rather intense hunt for a new hero shirt. I finally found it at Zara.'","Matilda Kahl, an art director at Saatchi & Saatchi, owns 15 of the same white shirt and several pairs of plain black trousers .

"A health expert has slammed parents for not taking vaccination seriously after 19 children attending a primary school in north Brisbane contracted the potentially deadly disease whooping cough. Kilcoy State School is working with Queensland Health after a whooping cough outbreak in the area, but parents have been urged to take vaccination more seriously there. The Sunshine Coast Daily reports that infectious diseases expert Professor Matthew Cooper, a professorial research fellow at the University of Queensland's Institute for Molecular Bioscience, attributed the outbreak to an anti-vaccination trend. Parents have been accused of not taking vaccination seriously after 19 children attending a primary school in north Brisbane contracted whooping cough . 'It's unfortunately just part of a growing trend that many people have decided not to immunise,' he said. 'We've seen this with other diseases that are more serious than pertussis but unfortunately the more people who choose not to immunise the more likely it is we'll get outbreaks.' Although immunisation rates in Queensland have dropped across most age groups there since 2010, in 2014 the Metro North region had the highest immunisation rate in the state. Kilcoy State School (pictured) in north Brisbane is working with Queensland Health after a whooping cough outbreak in the area . There are about 1200 cases of whooping cough every year in the Metro North area. This region covers the Brisbane River to past Caboolture. in total there have been 86 confirmed cases in 2015 - alarmingly 16 in the past week - compared to 113 last year. Statewide, 232 cases have been reported. Parents were urged to take children with any symptoms to their family doctor . Dr Cooper said it was essential to convince parents of the importance of vaccination. He said if vaccination rates continued to fall there could be an increase in unfortunate and preventable deaths. Parents were urged parents to take children with any symptoms to their family doctor, and for children who tested positive to stay away from school for five days.","Kilcoy State School working with Queensland Health to improve situation .

Now I am a Labour man and I will stand by my party, thick and thin. 'It's a bit like having a manager of a football team that you don't rate, but you still support the team, sometimes. 'What we have to do is work out how we can make the difference best, and from my point of view you're better on the inside making a difference than being on the outside grumbling about it.' To laughter from the audience, he was mocked by one of his fellow candidates for his 'glowing endorsement' for Labour's leader. Ed Miliband, pictured giving a speech in Stockton-on-Tees today, has promised to cut tuition fees from up to £9,000 to £6,000 if he is elected on May 7 . Ed Miliband has revealed his childhood dream was to become a London bus conductor. The Labour leader said a fascination with the ticket machines on the old-style vehicles had made him want the job. Mr Miliband made the admission during a visit to Stockton-on-Tees, where he was asked by a young boy in the audience, Nelson Driscoll, what he wanted to be when he was seven years old. He replied: 'I wanted to be a bus conductor. I tell you why, because on the London buses there used to be these things where you used to turn around the ticket machine. I was particularly fascinated by that.' Mr Miliband is not the only party leader to have dreamed of being on the buses. Conservative former prime minister Sir John Major once failed a test to become a bus conductor. The seat of Cheltenham is held by the Lib Dem Martin Horwood, who secured a majority of 4,920 over the Conservatives in 2010. But the constituency is seen as crucial to Tory hopes of winning an overall majority in the Commons. However, five years ago Labour secured just 5 per cent of the vote. Mr Miliband has promised to cut tuition fees from up to £9,000 to £6,000 if he is elected on May 7. Critics have argued the only people to benefit from the reductions will be wealthy graduates, because most people would never pay back the full amount during their working lifetime. But Mr Gilbert appeared to suggest the party should have gone further in reducing the cost of gaining a degree. He said: 'You know that in the Labour manifesto the fees will come down to £6,000 - it still feels entirely unsatisfactory.' He added: 'But it seems to me with two daughters who are 22 and 20, and they have been saddled with debt as the gentleman in the audience mentioned earlier. 'I find it really silly and really ridiculous that we have not worked this one through sufficiently well. 'We have choices. We have choices for all sorts of things, but we choose to spend the money on other things, and I wish we didn't, I wish we really didn't.' He finished his criticism of his party by adding: 'I don't like where we are, I wish it was different, but I hope we can see it differently going forward.'","Paul Gilbert jokes he hopes 'off-piste' remark will not get back to Miliband .

"The Middle East crisis deepened today as the US warned it will not 'stand by' while Iran supports rebels in Yemen. Secretary of State John Kerry said Washington would not accept foreign interference in the country in a direct criticism of Tehran's backing of Shiite Houthi fighters. It comes as a Saudi-led coalition continues to pound anti-government forces in Yemen at the start of a third week of bombing. Scroll down for video . US Secretary of State John Kerry has warned that the US will not 'stand by' while Iran supports rebels in Yemen . A member of the Saudi border guard is stationed at a look-out point on the Saudi-Yemeni border today. A Saudi-led coalition is continuing to pound anti-government forces in Yemen . Mr Kerry told PBS television: 'There have been - there are, obviously - flights coming from Iran. Every single week there are flights from Iran and we've traced it and know this. 'Iran needs to recognise that the United States is not going to stand by while the region is destabilised or while people engage in overt warfare across lines, international boundaries in other countries.' The United States has backed the Saudi-led campaign, which launched air strikes last month as the rebels advanced on Yemen's main southern city of Aden after seizing the capital Sanaa. President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi fled Aden for Saudi Arabia during the Houthi advance and the city has since seen heavy clashes between pro and anti-government forces. Riyadh has accused Tehran, the major Shiite power, of backing the rebels in a bid to establish a pro-Iran state on its doorstep. But Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif insisted his government wanted a swift end to the fighting, which has cost more than 640 lives since March 19, according to the World Health Organization. Military force: Saudi army tanks are seen deployed near the Saudi-Yemeni border, in southwestern Saudi Arabia . Patrol: Saudi guards drive tanks and armed vehicles along the border with Yemen . Mr Kerry, fresh from world powers striking a framework agreement with Iran on its nuclear programme, said Washington was not looking for confrontation with Tehran. 'But we're not going to step away from our alliances and our friendships and the need to stand with those who feel threatened as a consequence of the choices that Iran might be making.' In another sign of growing US support for the Saudi effort, the Pentagon said it had started daily aerial refuelling for warplanes in the coalition. The first refuelling flight took place on Tuesday night with a US Air Force KC-135 Stratotanker providing fuel for a F-15 fighter jet operated by Saudi Arabia and an F-16 flown by the United Arab Emirates, spokesman Colonel Steven Warren said. Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has warned that last week's  framework accord with world powers was no guarantee of a final nuclear deal. And President Hassan Rouhani said separately that the Islamic republic would not sign any final agreement unless 'all economic sanctions are totally lifted on the same day'. 'What has been done so far does not guarantee an agreement, nor its contents, nor even that the negotiations will continue to the end,' said Khamenei, who has the final word on all matters of state. After a week of gruelling last-ditch negotiations, Tehran and the six powers agreed on April 2 on the framework of a deal to be finalised by the end of June reining in Iran's nuclear programme in return for the lifting of international sanctions. 'Everything is in the detail, it may be that the other side, which is unfair, wants to limit our country in the details,' Khamenei said, in his first comments on the deal. Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has warned that last week's framework accord with world powers was no guarantee of a final nuclear deal . Playing down expectations of a deal after the interim accord - which sparked celebrations in the streets of Iranian cities - Khamenei said he had not taken any position until now as 'there is nothing to take a stance on'. 'Officials say that nothing has been done yet and there is nothing binding. I am neither for nor against.' Under the outline text agreed in the Swiss city of Lausanne between Tehran and the so-called P5+1 powers - the United States, Britain, China, France and Russia plus Germany - Iran must significantly reduce its number of centrifuges in exchange for a suspension of sanctions. The outline was a major breakthrough in a 12-year international crisis over Iran's nuclear programme. 'I have always supported and still support the Iranian negotiating team,' Khamenei said. 'I welcome any agreement that protects the interests and greatness of the nation, but having no agreement is more honourable than an agreement in which the interests and greatness of the nation is damaged.' Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said the Islamic republic would not sign any final agreement unless 'all economic sanctions are totally lifted on the same day' He said that retaining a civil nuclear industry in any agreement was vital for Iran's future development. 'The nuclear industry is a necessity, for energy production, for desalination, and in the fields of medicine, agriculture and other sectors,' he said. In a potential obstacle to any final deal, Rouhani said his country wanted sanctions lifted on the day of the implementation of any agreement. 'We will not sign any agreements unless on the first day of the implementation of the deal all economic sanctions are totally lifted on the same day,' he said. The pace at which the sanctions will be lifted is one of the outstanding issues that still has to be agreed in the final accord. Western governments, which have imposed their own sanctions over and above those adopted by the United Nations, have been pushing for it to happen only gradually. 'In return for Iran's future cooperation, we and our international partners will provide relief in phases from the sanctions that have impacted Iran's economy,' US Secretary of State John Kerry said last week. Rouhani, who was speaking on Iran's National Nuclear Technology Day, reiterated that his government remained determined to develop its civil nuclear programme. 'We will have a tanker sortie every day,' Warren said, adding that all flights will be outside of Yemeni air space. The air strikes killed at least 14 rebel fighters in Aden overnight Thursday at positions near the northern edge of the city, a source in pro-government forces told AFP. Air strikes also hit a military camp in the southern Shabwa province that was seized by the Houthis' main allies - security forces who have remained loyal to former strongman Ali Abdullah Saleh, a local official said. The official had no information on casualties among the forces loyal to Saleh, who has been accused of joining with the Houthis after being ousted from power in 2012 after an Arab Spring-inspired uprising. Yemen has been wracked by conflict since Saleh's ouster, with Hadi unable to assert government authority in a deeply tribal country riven by divisions. Supporters of the Shiite Houthi militia brandish their weapons in the Yemeni capital Sanaa. Washington has said it will not accept foreign interference in the country . Conflict: Yemeni supporters of the southern seperatist movement fire towards Houthi rebels during clashes in the southern city of Aden yesterday . As well as the Houthis, who hail from Yemen's north, the government has struggled against Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), considered the most dangerous of the jihadist network's branches. Authorities in Yemen had for years allowed Washington to carry out a drone war against AQAP but US forces pulled out of the country amid the latest unrest. Al-Qaeda has taken advantage of the chaos to seize control of some areas and carried out a series of deadly attacks on both government forces and the Houthis. As the fighting and air campaign drag on, concern has been growing for what aid workers say is a mounting humanitarian crisis. Some aid trickled in to Aden by ship on Wednesday but efforts by the International Committee of the Red Cross to organise flights of cargo planes into Sanaa have so far failed. In Aden, witnesses have said the situation is dire, with bodies lying in the streets and mosques calling through loudspeakers for help. Smoke and flames rise from Shiite Houthi rebel camps following an airstrike by the Saudi-led allianceearlier this week . A Yemeni child receives treatment at the burns unit of a hospital in Sanaa, following a reported airstrike by the Saudi-led coalition earlier this month . Diplomatic efforts have stepped up to resolve the conflict, with the Iranian and Pakistani foreign ministers pledging to work to find a negotiated solution. Zarif laid out a four-stage plan for talks, calling for an immediate ceasefire followed by humanitarian assistance, dialogue among Yemenis and the formation of an 'all-inclusive government'. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was also quoted on Thursday as calling for a regional effort to end the fighting. 'The groups in Yemen should meet and work on possible solution. Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Iran should be involved in efforts for a diplomatic solution,' Erdogan was quoted as saying by Turkish media.","Secretary of State John Kerry hits out at Iran's support of Houthi fighters .

"A supporter waits the best part of an hour for five seconds with Ryan Taylor. There is a quick picture and good-luck message ahead of Sunday's Tyne-Wear derby. He is, evidently, one of the few players genuinely respected by Newcastle's disillusioned fans. Taylor scored the winner at the Stadium of Light three seasons ago, affording him a terrace tribute – 'Ryan Taylor, over the wall' – as well as a place in black-and-white folklore. But there is more to the Toon Army's admiration than one free-kick against the enemy. A working-class Scouser who came through the ranks at Tranmere and made 100 appearances by the time he was 21 before beating three career-threatening injuries, Taylor 'gets' the proud principles of the North East – appreciation, hard graft, honesty and enjoyment. He has himself been a fan in the crowd during three of the last four derby defeats - he watched the other from a hotel room in America after undergoing surgery on the second of the cruciate ligament injuries which kept him out for 26 months. Newcastle utility player Ryan Taylor (right) shields the ball from Arsenal forward Danny Welbeck . Taylor scores with a superb free-kick against Sunderland to win the game 1-0 at the Stadium of Light . Taylor is congratulated by Newcastle defender Steven Taylor  in the club's last victory over Sunderland . Newcastle supported him through that long rehabilitation, something for which Taylor will always be grateful. But with his current contract at St James' Park set to expire this summer, the 30-year-old does not know what the future holds. He would like to remain on Tyneside. He accepts, though, that this could be his final taste of the fixture which has guaranteed him lifelong worship. 'I have to be realistic, this could be my last derby,' he told Sportsmail. 'I don't want it to be, but that will be in my mind. So I'm not going to let it go the way of the last four - that cannot carry on. 'I've left the stadium gutted after every one of them and I've felt it like a fan. So we owe it to them now. 'I grew up with Liverpool and Everton, but that isn't as big because you live in the same house a lot of the time. 'So I'll be doing everything I can personally do to make sure we're up for it, because our performances in the last four just haven't been good enough.' Taylor returned after more than two years of painstaking gym sessions alone for October's 2-0 win at Manchester City in the League Cup. He was man-of-the-match and was greeted by a standing ovation in the dressing-room, where text messages from the likes of Steven Gerrard and Michael Owen awaited. Ninety minutes against the champions, however, had taken its toll. In the next game, at home to QPR, St James' was stunned into silence when, after half an hour, a tearful Taylor sat himself on the turf clutching the same ill-fated knee. Taylor's injury record at Newcastle has severely limited his first-team appearances over the past few years . The 30-year-old is incredibly grateful to Newcastle for sticking by him and hopes to repay them on Sunday . 'I thought to myself, 'Why me?',' he reflects. 'You start doubting whether the knee will ever be strong enough. I was thinking, 'What have I skipped? What have I done wrong?'. 'Within an hour of the game I'd had a scan and the cruciate was fine, relief isn't the word. I'd probably got through the City game on pure adrenaline. So I think it was my body telling me just take your time. 'I won't lie, the fact I'm out of contract was on my mind and I wanted to be back sooner than the three months it took. 'Every game felt like another game off my career. But we did what was right and now there are no problems at all. 'I'll admit there were times when I thought I couldn't do it and my old man just told me 'no'. 'So when you've had the tears and those dark days, you appreciate every minute.' On the subject of dark days, both Newcastle and Sunderland are horribly out of form going into what has been billed as 'The Desperation Derby'. The Black Cats could be in the relegation zone by the time kick-off arrives, while Newcastle have lost their last three under John Carver. To suffer another loss in the derby could prove unforgivable in the eyes of supporters whose last victory arrived courtesy of Taylor's right boot in August, 2011. 'The good thing is we've got a cracking game now and if anything can rally us for the rest of the season then this is it,' says Taylor, who will start at right back. 'To be on a winning team on the ground where it all started for me would make everything worthwhile, all of the hard work and long days during those two years. 'But I remember that day so well. It was my first derby. I've played in two now and I'm yet to lose. 'Jonas (Gutierrez) won a foul just on the corner of the box. My first Premier League goal – for Wigan against Newcastle – was from that exact position, so I fancied it. 'I remember seeing Simon Mignolet edging out, almost inviting me to put it in the top corner. That's what I did. Steven Taylor tried to claim it, but he was nowhere near it. He tried to celebrate my goal by himself! 'I knew my dad and brother were in the away end celebrating and I just thought, 'Wow. They will be having some time in there'. Taylor is one of the most popular players at Newcastle for his consistent and hard working performances . 'Dan Gosling – one of my best mates – went through on goal in the last minute. Looking back, I'm probably relieved he didn't score to make it 2-0! 'I didn't realise at the time how big scoring the winner was and how much I would be remembered for just one goal. 'It'll be amazing if I'm coming back here in 10 years' time with my two boys and they're still singing that song.' Taylor adds: 'I'll always be a Newcastle fan. This club has been brilliant with me. I could have been the forgotten man but they stuck by me. 'Now I need to show them that I can stay fit. I've had some terrible luck, but I'd like to think I've got a lot left in me. 'So this final part of the season is massive for me – I would love to stay here.' And with that the supporter has his photo. 'What's going to happen on Sunday?' Taylor is asked. '1-0. Ryan Taylor. Over the wall,' he laughs. You can see why they like him in these parts. Taylor is out of contract at the end of the season and admits he does not know what the future has in store .","Ryan Taylor's injury record has severely limited the number of first-team appearances he has made for Newcastle .
Still, the 30-year-old utility player is one of the most popular at the club .

"A body found in the Mississippi River over the weekend has been identified as Minnesota fourth-grader Barway Edwin Collins who has been missing for nearly four weeks. Authorities said the body of the ten-year-old was found on Saturday around 1pm by searchers from a Boy Scout troop - about ten feet from the river's edge in Brooklyn Center. Crystal Police Chief Stephanie Revering said authorities have electronic evidence that shows the boy's father, Pierre Collins, 33, was in that area at the time the boy disappeared. However, she did not elaborate on the nature of that evidence. Police said on Sunday that the boy's father is a primary suspect as the case becomes a homicide investigation. A body pulled from the Mississippi River on Saturday has been identified as Barway Edward Collins (above), 10, who has been missing for nearly a month . Crystal Police Chief Stephanie Revering said authorities have electronic evidence that reveals that the boy's father, Pierre Collins, was in that area at the time he disappeared (above Revering during a news conference on April 12, 2015 in Crystal, Minnesota) Barway's father, 33-year-old Pierre Collins (pictured left as he stands with his wife, Yamah, during a vigil held for his son last month) is a primary suspect in the homicide investigation involving his son . 'This location is consistent with our knowledge of Pierre Collin's activities on March 18 and he remains a primary suspect,' said Revering. The Hennepin County Medical Examiner said the cause and manner of Barway's death are still being investigated. The case is being considered a homicide based on the autopsy and information from the medical examiner, said Revering. A report last month by Fox 9 said that according to sources, Pierre Collins, took out a life insurance policy in Barway's name totaling $30,000 not long before the child went missing. The boy's father, who has said he is innocent, has not been arrested or charged in relation to the incident, but Revering said authorities have his passport to ensure he stays in the country. Police were stationed at his apartment complex for his own protection after reports of death threats. On Sunday, Pastor Harding Smith, of the Spiritual Church of God who has been acting as the family's spokesman said when the family received the news, there were a lot of tears, according to Twin Cities. 'There were lots of tears and lots of screams,' he said. 'There was disbelief, hurt, sadness. There is a deep sense of loss when you enter that home.' Alexander Collins, executive director of the Liberian Ministry Association, said: 'We also want to make clear to the perpetrator of this tragedy, that wherever you are, you will be found. This evil will be found. 'Wherever you are hiding, under a car, underground, make no mistake our community does not abide this evil.' The Hennepin County Medical Examiner said the cause and manner of Barway's death are still being investigated . Barway, who was a student at Evergreen Park World Cultures Community School, was last seen after school last month. In video released by police (scenes from footage above), Barway says 'there's my dad' and 'there's my uncle' In a March 25 interview with the Star Tribune, Pierre Collins said he was not home when his son disappeared and he was upset to be considered a suspect. 'I've been working with the police just to bring my son home,' he told the newspaper. 'I will do whatever they want just so Barway can come home. I have nothing to do with Barway's missing.' His wife and Barway's stepmother, Yamah Collins, also said she and her husband did not know who took the boy, and they pleaded for his safe return. Pierre Collins (right), accompanied by Pastor Harding Smith (center), the family's spokesman, was interviewed by Nancy Grace last month, saying that he failed the polygraph test because he was very emotional . Police said on Sunday that the boy's father (above) is a 'primary suspect' as the case becomes a homicide investigation . Police released a video of Barway riding a bus after school. In the video, the boy said 'there's my dad' and 'there's my uncle.' 'The father and the party described as an 'uncle' are likely the last known people to have seen Barway,' Revering said, as reported by the Star-Tribune. 'Unfortunately, we have reason to believe that Barway's father has not been completely truthful with us.' Addressing the footage on the bus, Pierre Collins explained to Nancy Grace that in the Liberian community, children commonly refer to adults as 'uncle' or 'auntie.' When pressed by Grace about the failed polygraph test, Collins explained that he was 'very emotional' during the test. 'I wasn't...myself when I took the polygraph,' he said. The boy was reported missing by his father at around 6.30pm on March 18 after the child failed to come home from school (above a massive billboard featuring a missing ad for Barway) Barway, who was a student at Evergreen Park World Cultures Community School, was last seen after school last month. The boy was reported missing by his father at around 6.30pm on March 18 after the child failed to come home from school. A call to the school bus company revealed that the 10-year-old was dropped off outside his building at around 4.15pm. Video surveillance from his apartment complex shows he was about to go inside, but then turned around as if he was called over to the parking lot by someone he knew, and he walked away, police said last month.

A young boy adds a donation for Barway Collins' family to the pile during the vigil last month . The family told the Star Tribune that Barway emigrated from his home country of Liberia, where his mother lives, to stay with his father in 2011. The father said he wanted 'to make him better' and for Barway to eventually go to college. While looking for Barway, local police, federal agents and Hennepin County's sheriff's deputies searched the area with K-9 dogs, reviewing footage from surveillance cameras and interviewing family members and witnesses.","Barway Edwin Collins, 10, went missing from his Crystal, Minnesota apartment complex March 18 after school .

"Militants fighting for the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq are being led by a highly secretive group of strategists and officials that were once senior figures in Saddam Hussein's army. Despite thousands of foreign fighters flocking to join the Sunni extremist group and starring in their propaganda videos, ISIS' leadership is dominated by ex-members of the late Iraqi dictator's military. Almost all of the regional commanders appointed by ISIS' leader and self-declared caliph, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, played prominent roles in the Baathist army before the 2003 invasion of Iraq and became involved with ISIS either in the resulting insurgency or after the dictator's 2006 execution. Influence: Despite thousands of foreign fighters flocking to join the Sunni extremist group and starring in their propaganda videos, ISIS' leadership is dominated by ex-members of the military of Saddam Hussein (pictured) Militants: Almost all the highly secretive officials overseeing the day-to-day running of the Islamic State (pictured) are former members of Saddam Hussein's Baathist army . One of the most prominent former Iraqi Army generals within ISIS was Abu Muslim al-Turkmani (left) who led the terrorists' operations in Iraq until he was killed in an American airstrike last November. Abu Ayman al-Iraqi (right), a former colonel in Iraqi Air Force intelligence now plays a leading role in ISIS' military council . One former Syrian rebel who became an ISIS regional commander told the Washington Post that he found that almost all of the highly secretive officials overseeing all aspects to the terror group's day-to-day business were ex members of Hussein's Baathist army. During one meeting in which he dared to disagree with fellow commanders at an ISIS meeting, the man calling himself Abu Hamza was placed under arrest on the orders of a masked man who had sat silently and almost unnoticed at the side of the room, listening and taking notes. Although the enigmatic commander's real name was never revealed to him, Hamza said that he later discovered that the man had been an intelligence officer for the Iraqi army before joining ISIS. The same went for the other ISIS commanders Hamza met, who either used code names or no names at all in the hope of concealing their past as members of Hussein's army. As well as their extensive military expertise, another key element of the commanders' appointments has been the fact the ex-Baathists have extensive contacts among oil smugglers thanks to Hussein's efforts to avoid international sanctions in the 1990s. Crucially, oil smuggling is considered the most lucrative aspect of ISIS' £2 billion-a-year income. Leader: Almost all of the regional commanders appointed by ISIS' leader and self-declared caliph, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured), played prominent roles in the Baathist army before the 2003 invasion of Iraq . Experience: Former Iraqi Army colonel Haji Bakr (left) was al-Baghdadi's closest advisor and the overall head of his military council until his execution at the hands of Syrian rebels in January 2014. Pictured right is Abu Ahmad al-Alwani - a former Baathist soldier and now an ISIS military council member . The former Iraqi Army generals' connections with oil smugglers are crucial to ISIS' £2 billion-a-year income . Middle East analysts and experts believe one key reason why so many former Iraqi army commanders have joined ISIS is due to the de-Baathification law brought in L.­ Paul Bremer - the American who served as temporary head of the Iraqi state following the ousting of Hussein. The law effectively meant that 400,000 members of the defeated Iraqi army could no longer be employed in government roles and were barred from drawing their military pensions. Many of these highly-trained commanders joined the insurgency in the country in the mid-2000s, which was dominated by ISIS who at the time were known by the name Al Qaeda in Iraq. When al-Baghdadi took control of the group in 2010, many of these commanders were given prominent leadership roles in the hope they might win the support of the Sunni tribes who dominate Western Iraq and who have been largely ignored by the country's Shia-led Baghdad government. The process had, however been started by al-Baghdadi's predecessor Abu Omar al-Baghdadi who was himself a former Iraqi Army officer and therefore more trusted by the military than the Jordanian criminal, former gangster and ex-alcoholic who founded ISIS, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Past: The process of giving former Iraqi commanders senior roles was started by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's predecessor Abu Omar al-Baghdadi (left) who was a former Iraqi Army officer and therefore more trusted than the Jordanian criminal, former gangster and ex-alcoholic who founded ISIS, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi (right) Heartbreaking: The highest estimate for the number of recruits killed in the Speicher massacre is about 1,700 . Discovery: The graves were found last Wednesday on the late Saddam Hussein's presidential compound . One of the most prominent former Iraqi Army generals within ISIS was Fadel Ahmad Abdullah al-Hiyali, who used the code name Abu Muslim al-Turkmani, and was in charge of all the terrorists' operations in Iraq until he was killed in an American airstrike last November. He had previously been a colonel in military intelligence and served in Hussein's Republican Guard. Other senior figures include Abu Ali al-Anbari, who currently acts as Baghdadi's deputy leader in Syria and is a former military general in Hussein's Iraqi Army, and Abu Ayman al-Iraqi, a former colonel in Iraqi Air Force intelligence and now plays a leading role in ISIS' military council. Less prominent militants with an Iraqi Army backgrounds include Abu Ahmad al-Alwani - a former Baathist soldier and now an ISIS military council member, Abu Kassem - a former Iraqi officer and now in charge of ISIS suicide bombers and foreign fighters. Another former Iraqi Army colonel was Haji Bakr, who is widely considered to have been al-Baghdadi's closest advisor and the overall head of his military council until his execution at the hands of a rebel group known as the Syrian Martyr's Brigade in January 2014. It is widely believed that all of the senior ISIS figures killed over the past year - including Haji Bakr - have been replaced by former members of the Iraqi Army. Horror: Images like this one of the soldiers being led through Tikrit shocked Iraq and the world . This morning Iraqi forensic teams in the newly liberated city of Tikrit have started exhuming bodies from mass graves believed to contain some of the hundreds of soldiers killed by ISIS last year. Kamil Amin, from Iraq's Human Rights Ministry, said the work on eight locations started yesterday inside Tikrit's complex of presidential palaces, where much of the killing is thought to have occured. ISIS overran Saddam Hussein's hometown last June, capturing around 1,700 soldiers as they were trying to flee Camp Speicher, an air base previously used by U.S. troops on the outskirt of Tikrit. The fall of Tikrit was part of the ISIS onslaught that stunned Iraqi security forces and the military, which melted away as the militants advanced and captured key cities and towns in the country's north and west. Later, ISIS group posted graphic images online that showed gunmen massacring scores of the soldiers after forcing them to lay face-down in a ditch with their arms tied behind their backs. After weeks of bitter clashes, Iraqi forces and allied Shiite militias, succeeded in retaking Tikrit from ISIS. Their victory was helped by U.S.-led coalition airstrikes.","ISIS leadership is dominated by former members of Hussein's Iraqi Army .

Destiny Cooke, 16, and Lajahia Cooke, 17, were brutally kicked, punched, stomped and shoved around by the mob, who can be heard laughing during the five-minute video filmed in Trenton. Lajahia said one girl ripped out her earring out before the girl's mother threw a rock at her ear, leaving a gash that required 12 stitches. Scroll down for video . Sisters Destiny Cooke, 16, and Lajahia Cooke, 17, were brutally kicked, punched, stomped and shovedy a crowd of people, including grown adults and parents, in a park in Trenton, New Jersey . People can be heard laughing throughout the video and chanting 'they gettin' busy!' or 'let her get her!' And Destiny has been left with a bald spot after someone grabbed a chunk of her hair. Throughout the video various people hold the girls down so that others can punch them over and over again. One guy can be heard gleefully screaming 'they gettin' busy!' At one point, according to ABC 7, someone tries to break up the fight but an adult is determined to let it continue, screaming 'let her get her!' But perhaps the most disturbing part of the video is when, while Destiny is on the ground, her skirt rides up and men proceed to laugh and take pictures, one even exclaiming 'somebody smack that!' Destiny said she was play fighting with her friend at the park on a nice day during spring break last Monday before the riot broke out. She said people saw her and her friend and got the wrong idea. They came back with a crowd of people who, she said, were looking for a fight. When Lajahia tried to step in and help Destiny, all hell broke loose. 'It just escalated from there,' Destiny told NJ.com. 'Just like a riot broke out, they just started hitting us.' Destiny said she called her mother and asked her to pick the girls, telling her there were 'grown women' walking up to the sisters. That's when then the 16-year-old first got hit, causing her to drop her phone. 'I just had to defend myself,' she told MY 9 NJ. The girls said they saw multiple police cars at the park as they left. Destiny said no one got out to offer the girls any help, even as Destiny's nose was bleeding. Destiny (pictured) has been left with a bald spot after people pulled on her hair throughout the fight . Lajahia said one girl ripped an earring out of her ear, and then the girl's mother threw a rock at her ear, leaving a gash that required 12 stitches . 'They just stayed in their cars and just looked at us,' Destiny said. 'I just felt like we were out there by ourselves and there were people stomping us on our head,' she told NJ.com. 'Nobody was out there trying to help us - nobody.' According to police spokesman Lt. Stephen Varn, patrol officers received a 911 call for a reported street fight. Two patrol units arrived at the scene of the brawl and reported that no other police officers were needed. Trenton Mayor Eric Jackson released a statement saying he was angered 'by the lack of good Samaritans who should have stepped forward to come to the aid of these victims'. A park ranger has since been installed to monitor Greg Grant Park. Police Captain Eddie Gonzalez called the video 'sickening' and said the department had identified 'a number of individuals that were a part of this'. 'We will take swift action with them very, very shortly,' he said. 'Warrants will be issued in the very near future.' Destiny said police just 'stayed in their cars' and stared as she and her sister Lajahia (pictured) left the park after being brutally beaten .","Destiny Cooke, 16, and Lajahia Cooke, 17 were beaten by a mob in Trenton .

"Gemma Redhead was left terrified after her former partner telephoned her after he was released from prison, following a conviction for raping her . Brutally raped at knifepoint and left fearing for her life, Gemma Redhead believed her ordeal was over after her attacker was jailed. But as she attempted to rebuild her life, the young mother had a sickening reminder of the attack – from the man who carried it out. After he was released from prison, having served only half his sentence, he defied a restraining order to phone her. Miss Redhead said the 46-second call ‘reawakened all of the fear and terror of the attack’, leaving her unable to sleep or eat. ‘As soon as I heard his voice I realised who it was, and it disturbed something deep down inside of me,’ she said. Miss Redhead, 33, who has waived her right to anonymity, was left with post-traumatic stress disorder after being repeatedly raped by her former partner, Philip Kirby. She endured eight years of violence at the hands of bullying Kirby and his attacks became so brutal she lived in fear every day, thinking he would kill her. In August 2010 the mother-of-four, who has a child with Kirby, decided to break up with him. After they separated, Kirby, 32, refused to acknowledge the end of their relationship and begged Miss Redhead to take him back. He continued to harass her and eventually forced his way into her home before subjecting her to a harrowing ordeal. After the first horrifying attack, Miss Redhead begged him to leave, but he told her: ‘I’m already going to jail for a long time so what difference does it make?’ before raping her again. Kirby, of Newcastle, initially denied rape. But on the first day of his trial he changed his plea, admitting four counts of rape. In April 2011, he was jailed for eight years with a five-year extended licence period. He was also handed a restraining order which banned any contact with Miss Redhead for the rest of her life. Meanwhile she began counselling, including cognitive therapy, and medication to help her overcome her post-traumatic stress disorder. But she says her hopes of rebuilding her life have now been shattered. She said: ‘It is a daily struggle and an ongoing battle to deal with this. After his initial arrest I was hopeful for the future and felt free and that I could begin to rebuild my life. Philip Kirby had been sentenced to eight years in prison but was released after three years, and phoned his former partner. The rapist had been banned from contacting her for life and will now not be released until 2023 . ‘I now feel it will never be so and he will not leave me alone.’ Referring to the chilling phonecall, Miss Redhead added: ‘But at the same time I was not surprised. I had always felt as though he would come after me once he was released.’ She said Kirby had tried to ‘destroy’ her and she feared he would continue to harass her for the rest of her life. ‘We tried so hard to rebuild our lives after he virtually destroyed it,’ she said. ‘He will never leave us alone. We just can’t escape him. We feel trapped by his behaviour. Why can’t he just leave us alone to get on with our lives? I just want my family to be left in peace.’ Miss Redhead described herself as being in an ‘extreme state of anxiety’ since the phone call from Kirby. She said: ‘I will no longer go outside on my own. I can’t eat or sleep and when I do sleep I have constant nightmares and flashbacks. I am really scared. Ms Redhead was left with post traumatic stress disorder after the attack. She is pictured (above) with Kirby during their relationship . ‘Despite telling probation he wouldn’t contact me, he has. Prison has not been a deterrent for him. I feel very fearful of what he would do next. ‘I am still full of fear. I would like to be free of fear and not constantly worrying about his next release date.’ After the phone call Kirby was hauled back to court and he admitted breaching his restraining order. On Friday, Newcastle Crown Court heard that Kirby was released from prison in November last year and after drinking vodka he decided to contact his victim last month. He was sentenced to a further six months and will not be released until 2023, serving his full jail term. Judge Deborah Sherwin said: ‘What makes this matter particularly bad is the effect she suffered at your hands originally. ‘It is not part of my function to sentence you again in respect of that but it is the legacy of that, that she feels vulnerable and afraid, therefore any phone calls made by you would have a greater effect on her than they might do to any other person.’","Philip Kirby was jailed for eight years in 2011 for raping Gemma Redhead .

"Keeping David de Gea at the club would be the biggest signing Manchester United could make this summer, says Phil Neville. The Spanish keeper has impressed for Louis van Gaal's side this season and has heavily been linked with a move to Real Madrid, who are looking for a long-term replacement for Iker Casillas. United have been linked with their own big-money moves for the likes of Gareth Bale and Mats Hummels, but Neville believes the club must concentrate on keeping De Gea at Old Trafford. David de Gea met Man United fans earlier in the week as part of a day organised by the club's foundation . De Gea punches the ball away during Manchester United's 1-0 defeat to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge . 'The biggest thing is David De Gea, and keeping him at the football club,' Neville told the Manchester Evening News. 'From when he first came, to how he is now, I don’t think I’ve seen a player develop and improve as quickly as him. 'I saw with Cristiano (Ronaldo), I saw the development in terms of his performance, his size, his stature and his physique. 'He’s winning football games on his own. Last minutes saves against Everton, Hull, Arsenal away - there’s seven or eight occasions where he has won United games which just shows you that he is world-class.'","David de Gea has been integral to Man United's success this season .

"A Michigan father convicted of abusing his then-11-week-old daughter who might lose parental rights to his only child claims his baby was never abused. Joshua Quincy Burns, formerly of Brighton, was sentenced to three years' probation with the first served in Livingston County Jail for second-degree child abuse earlier this month. Joshua Burns and and his wife, Brenda Burns, say he is innocent, and that he grabbed their daughter Naomi's face when she slipped from his lap as he ended a phone call with his wife in March 2014. He claims he was trying to save her from hitting her head on a coffee table in their home. His now-one-year-old daughter suffered several injuries, including seizures, hypothermia, hypotension, bradycardia, apnea and retinal hemorrhages. But the couple call it 'an accident', not child abuse. Scroll down for video . Joshua Burns (right) was sentenced to three years' probation with the first served in Livingston County Jail for second-degree child abuse after his daughter Naomi (in his arms) suffered several injuries. He and his wife Brenda Burns (left) maintain Joshua Burns's innocence . Brenda Burns has refused to allow social workers and Michigan's Department of Human Services to see Naomi, according to the Livingston Daily. She was not charged criminally in the case, and a civil jury - when the state was seeking to end parental rights - found Brenda Burns not accountable for Naomi's injuries. The couple started a website called TornFamily in hopes of raising awareness of their situation and reunite their family. They will also be sharing their story on an episode of Dr Phil on Monday, and Joshua Burns maintains his innocence throughout the episode. 'I never abused my daughter,' he claims in the preview for the show. Joshua Burns claims he never abused little Naomi, and she suffered injuries after she slipped off his lap while he was ending a phone call with his wife and in an attempt to save his daughter from hitting her head on a coffee table he grabbed her by the face . Brenda Burns (right) has fled from Michigan to Colorado with Naomi in an attempt to escape being watched by DHS. Their oversight has been put on hold until a June hearing where Joshua Burns's parental rights will be determined . After the incident, baby Naomi suffered several injuries, including seizures, hypothermia, hypotension, bradycardia, apnea and retinal hemorrhages . 'Then why are you in jail?' Dr Phil asks in return. Brenda Burns claims that a Child Protective Services worker and five police officers entered their home and searched her house when the incident occurred. 'I literally thought: Do you have the right family?' she said to Dr Phil. Brenda Burns's attorney Elizabeth Warner said that the mother has the right to not be monitored by the government, and 'certainly not by the agency that takes children' because she was not held responsible for the injuries and is seen as 'the fit parent' Earlier this month, Judge Miriam Cavanaugh said the DHS's supervision of Naomi would continue but is on hold pending the decision as to whether or not Joshua Burns will continue to have parental rights, according to the Free Press. Joshua Burns continues to claim he's innocent. In an episode of Dr Phil airing Monday, he says, 'I never abused my daughter' Even though her husband has been jailed, Brenda Burns supports her husband and agrees that the incident was 'an accident', not child abuse . Brenda Burns fled to Colorado to avoid being watched DHS, which she believes is unconstitutional. Naomi's court-appointed attorney has reportedly seen the child and says told the Livingston County Circuit Court that the baby is doing well. Warner, Brenda Burns's attorney, said that Naomi is 'doing very well' and that 'she's pretty advanced for her age'. She said: 'You can see pictures of a sick child with tubes in them and think she's going to be brain damaged forever. 'In fact, if this was a misdiagnosis as we think it was, I think the fact Naomi is so well really supports the parents' position this wasn't abuse. It was a misdiagnoses by a doctor. 'It's something she recovered from.' The hearing over the potential termination of Joshua Burns's parental rights is in June.

"Many people might think that trust issues, long distances and cheating scandals are the biggest strains on a relationship. But they are wrong. It's IKEA. A psychology expert has confirmed that shopping at or assembling furniture from the Scandinavian store chain can be a serious source of friction between a couple, thanks to the high levels of stress caused by both activities. 'The store literally becomes a map of a relationship nightmare,' Ramani Durvasula, a clinical psychologist in Santa Monica, California, told The Wall Street Journal. Scroll down for video . Can your relationship handle it? Experts say that shopping at IKEA can cause serious friction between couples - and assembling the store's wares makes it even worse . 'Walking through the kitchens brings up touchy subjects, like who does most of the cooking. Then you get to the children’s section, which opens up another set of issues. And that’s before you've even tried assembling anything,' she said. Ramani revealed that so many couples admitted to her that they were prone to fighting while assembling furniture, that she decided to include furniture assembly in her therapy sessions. And her couples are not alone; a report by CivicScience states that 17 per cent of couples confessed that they would argue every time they assembled furniture together, and therapists reported to WSJ that couples who are able to successfully assemble furniture together as a team actually have a healthier relationship. 'The Divorcemaker': This Liatorp home entertainment unit requires two people for assembly and involves putting together a large amount of shelving . Shopping for trouble: Clinical psychologist Ramani Durvasula brings furniture assembly into therapy sessions after so many couples described fighting while putting together IKEA items . Getting into particulars, Ramani explained that the more complicated the assembly, the more likely your new IKEA buy will leave you and your partner at odds. She revealed that a smaller unit like a Nornäs coffee table won't put too many demands on your relationship, but it's a different story for a large wall unit like the $1,199 Liatorp unit, which Ramani has dubbed 'The Divorcemaker'. The description of the item on IKEA's website includes a lengthy 'Good To Know' section outlining the different ways you can mess up the unit's assembly, saying that you need two people to put it together. 'Handle with care!' it reads. 'A damaged edge or scratched surface can in exceptional cases cause the glass to crack suddenly. However, never into sharp fragments, only into small pieces. Avoid collisions from the side - this is where the glass is most vulnerable.' Its relationship-ruining qualities don't seem to be doing the the home furnishings giant any harm however, as it has 298 stores in 26 countries, and boasts a revenue of more than $36 billion a year. As for how to avoid having the dreaded 'IKEA meltdown' with your partner, Janice Simonsen, design spokesperson for IKEA US, recommends to WSJ that you agree on a style before walking into the store.","A psychology expert has revealed that the stress of a visit to the store can cause serious friction between couples .

"Claudia Martin, 33, has been convicted of suffocating her newborn baby daughter . A mother-of-five has been convicted of killing her newborn baby girl by filling her mouth with toilet paper and hiding her body in a suitcase. Claudia Martins gave birth alone at her sister's flat having kept her pregnancy secret from her family and friends. Paramedics were called after the 33-year-old, a Portuguese national, was found sitting in the bath with 'a lot of blood' and she was taken to hospital. Earlier she had killed the infant by stuffing toilet paper down its throat. She then wrapped the baby girl in towels and a plastic bag and hid the body in a suitcase - where it lay undiscovered for three days. Martins was acquitted by a jury of a single charge of murder but convicted of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility. During her trial at Bristol Crown Court the jury was told she gave birth alone at her sister's flat in Knowle, Bristol on September 12 last year. Adam Vaitilingam QC, prosecuting, said: 'She told no-one of her pregnancy and gave birth in as secretive a way as she could, for someone living in a crowded flat, and kept the fact of that birth secret from all those around her and closest to her, including her sister. 'She placed the body of the baby in a suitcase, hidden from anyone. 'No doubt, we suggest she intended to dispose of it but was prevented from doing so by the arrival of the paramedics, who took her off to hospital.' Two days later, her sister Vilma raised the alarm after noticing a smell coming from a suitcase in the defendant's bedroom. Police were called to the flat and discovered the body of a newborn baby inside Martins' small, black suitcase, on September 15. Martins, described as having an extremely low IQ, was arrested and admitted she had given birth but said the baby was stillborn. A post-mortem examination found a wad of toilet paper inside the baby's mouth, which experts claim was 'deliberately inserted'. The jury heard Martins is originally from Mozambique in Africa but moved to Portugal before settling in Bristol in 2011, living in a two-bedroom flat with her sister Vilma Marshall, Ms Marshall's partner, and five children. Giving evidence, Martins told the court: 'I did not kill my daughter. I did not put tissue paper in her throat. I didn't kill her. No, I did not kill my daughter.' Mr Justice Teare remanded Martins, of Marshall Walk, Knowle, Bristol into custody to await the preparation of reports. She will be sentenced at a later date. Detective Inspector Neil Meade, of Avon and Somerset Police, said: 'The death of a baby is always a tragedy but the unique circumstances make this a particularly emotive case for everyone involved. 'We carried out a sensitive and comprehensive investigation into the circumstances of the baby girl's death and obtained statements from medical experts specialising in this field. 'We've also worked closely with the Crown Prosecution Service from the outset. The jury has listened to the evidence and convicted Claudia Martins of manslaughter. 'Our thoughts are very much with the victim's wider family as they are struggling to comprehend how and why this tragedy happened.' Martins was acquitted by a jury of a single charge of murder but convicted of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility at Bristol Crown Court, pictured .","Claudia Martins convicted of the manslaughter of her newborn baby girl .

"Her brother-in-law has led a personal crusade against poaching and protecting vulnerable wildlife. So Pippa Middleton’s decision to enjoy a plate of whale meat on holiday may have been rather difficult for Prince William to swallow. The 31-year-old, who styles herself as a food and lifestyle writer, has told of eating Minke whale – even though it is largely banned worldwide. She boasted of tucking into the delicacy in Norway, to the horror of environmental campaigners who say she is helping promote an ‘unimaginably cruel’ trade. Scroll down for video . Pippa Middleton has been slammed for ‘promoting the cruel and unnecessary whaling industry’. She's pictured here at the 2014 GQ Men Of The Year awards in London . In a gushing newspaper feature, the Duchess of Cambridge’s younger sister described how the smoked meat was served in a ‘wonderfully convivial atmosphere’ at the Juvet Landscape Hotel in north-west Norway. Tucking into a starter prepared carpaccio-style – raw and very thinly sliced – she wrote: ‘We dined on smoked whale carpaccio (which tastes similar to smoked salmon but looks more like venison carpaccio).’ Ms Middleton said that she ate whale carpaccio in a 'convivial atmosphere on a large communal table' Earlier she had enjoyed a steam bath and rubbed ice on her body in a ‘snow spa’ at the upmarket hotel, where she spent the night in a £170-a-night ‘designer pod’. The hunting and importation of whale meat is banned in Britain, as it is in most parts of the world, by both the International Whaling Commission and by the international wildlife convention CITES. But Norway – as well as Japan and Iceland – has exploited legal loopholes that allow it to opt out of regulations. Last year it killed around 730 Minke whales, the highest number since it broke the moratorium on commercial whaling in 1993. Campaigners have long called for a crackdown, arguing the hunting process is ‘unimaginably cruel and inhumane’. The socialite, writing in the Daily Telegraph, said that she ate whale at the £123-a-night Juvet Landscape Hotel (pictured) Ms Middleton said that the dinner was cooked by Knut, the hotel’s owner. The Duchess of Cambridge's sister said that the establishment was an 'architectural gem' Pippa Middleton would be breaking British law if she had tucked into the whale meat in the UK. Britain has signed up to the International Whaling Commission, which makes it illegal to import or eat whale meat in this country. Whaling is also prohibited under EU law, but Norway is not a member of the EU. Last season, 731 minke whales were killed in Norway off the country’s northern coasts. The whaling season runs from April to August, when they are hunted from boats using grenade-propelled harpoons, which are shot from cannons into the whale’s chest. In the 1960s and 70s whale meat was commonly served in Norwegian school canteens and as part of military rations. It then fell out of favour, but has recently been adopted as a gourmet food trend. Fish market manager Marius Tvethaug said: ‘Smoked whale is one of the oldest ways to keep food for a long time. And we’ve been catching whale since the Stone Age. I would say it’s kind of back to our roots.’ Even with modern harpoons powered by explosives, the mammals often died a ‘slow and painful’ death. Critics said Miss Middleton’s decision to eat whale meat was at odds with the stance taken by Prince William – even though he too has been attacked for continuing to hunt wild game. She has also been photographed hunting in the past. Vanessa Williams-Grey, of Whale and Dolphin Conservation, said: ‘It might have been better for Pippa to take a whale watch trip in Norway. She might then have thought twice about condoning and indeed, promoting, this cruel and unnecessary trade.’ Philip Mansbridge, UK director of the International Fund for Animal Welfare, said she was ‘unwittingly setting a bad example’ that may encourage other tourists. A spokesman for Miss Middleton, who travelled on the junket for the Daily Telegraph, refused to comment last night. But Knut Slinning, owner of Juvet Landscape Hotel, said he had no plans to stop serving whale meat because it has been eaten for ‘many hundreds of years’. However, Siri Martinsen, of Norway’s animals rights group NOAH, said Miss Middleton has a ‘special responsibility’ not to support animal cruelty. Last year 731 minke whales suffered an agonising death at the hand of Norwegian whalers, according to WDC. Pictured is a minke whale on the deck of a Japanese vessel . Three Greenpeace inflatables  interrupt whaling on board the Norwegian whaling vessel Kato in the Southern whaling grounds in the North Sea .

"BBC presenter Charlie Stayt has been blasted after he misspelt the word 'education' during a live report on the issue.

Whilst Mike Knowles tweeted: 'If you're presenting a live report about education on #BBCBreakfast maybe double check how you spell education.' Viewer John Morley added: 'Fantastic, #bbcbreakfast presenter can't spell education.' Crafty Monkey wrote: '@BBCBreakfast C-!! Could do better!' Afterwards, Bill Turnbull told Stayt he had started a Twitter frenzy and made him spell out the word education live on air. He said: 'There we go, it was a typo, we'll forgive him.' Presenter Sally Nugent added: 'I don't think that spelling mistake was that bad.' Stayt said: 'Let's just call it one of those things.' But Turnbull added: 'You've only caused a Twitter frenzy in two-and-a-half minutes.' Nugent said: 'I don't think anyone's noticed.'

Afterwards, colleague Bill Turnbull made red-faced Stayt spell the word 'education' US politician Dan Quayle was mocked when he misspelt the word 'potato' on a school blackboard on June 15, 1992 when he was visiting a school in Trenton as part of his official duties. He took part in a spelling bee when students had to write words on a blackboard. When it was 12-year-old William Figueroa's turn he had to write the word 'potato'. But Quayle pointed out: 'You're close, but you left a little something off. The e on the end'.

"'Boring' has been the word on everyone's lips when talking about Chelsea this week, but Didier Drogba has shown he and his team-mates still have the skill to disprove that disparaging tag. The Blues are preparing for Wednesday night's trip to Leicester City at St George's Park, having drawn criticism for the way they ground out a decisive 0-0 draw against Arsenal on Sunday. And Drogba and his team-mates, who can wrap up the Barclays Premier League title with two more victories, have shown off their abilities with an intricate six-man heading trick around the dinner table. Didier Drogba hit back at claims that Chelsea were boring with a video of them completing a 'bin challenge' After the ball is headed by Loic Remy and Eden Hazard, John Terry heads to Drogba in the six-man task . After Drogba, goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois is the next to take the ball, heading back to John Obi Mikel . Mikel stoops with a diving header that sees him fall off his chair, but the ball does drop into the small bin . Manager Jose Mourinho shot back at claims that his side were boring this week, insisting that going 10 years without winning the league - as Arsenal have - was more boring, and now Drogba has added to the retort with a video captioned: 'Boring boring chelseaaaa!!!!!!' With six players seated opposite each other on either side of a long table, Branislav Ivanovic throws the ball on to the head of Loic Remy to start the game. He heads back to Eden Hazard, who then directs it on to John Terry followed by Drogba and Thibaut Courtois before John Obi Mikel stoops to knock the ball into a bin with a diving header. After just about managing to complete the feat all seven players celebrate wildly, the sort of scenes that might be seen against Crystal Palace on Sunday if Chelsea win at the King Power Stadium and then on their return to Stamford Bridge. The champions-elect have been preparing for Wednesday night's game at the National Football Centre at Burton-on-Trent since Monday, where they are staying at the on-site Hilton Hotel. While French forward Remy was more than willing to jump around with his team-mates in the video at the hotel, he has been ruled out of the game against Leicester by  Mourinho. With Mikel on the floor, Courtois and Terry leap into the air in celebrations that could soon be repeated . The seven players involved in the game at St George's Park jump around in a celebratory huddle . Drogba and his team-mates can wrap up the Barclays Premier League title with two more league victories . Diego Costa is also a doubt having missed almost a month of action with a hamstring problem that has bugged him for much of the season. Midfielder Oscar has a chance of returning from the concussion he suffered against Arsenal in a challenge by goalkeeper David Ospina on Sunday. St George's Park, which opened in October 2012, is used by the full range of England teams as well as club sides. Barcelona, Galatasaray and Monaco are among the visiting teams to have stayed there.

"Selfie queen Karen Danczuk has revealed her ambition to be an MP – insisting she could relate to ordinary women unlike the current crop of female politicians. Mrs Danczuk said women were turned off politics because there was no-one in Parliament like them. The glamorous Labour councillor, who is married to the outspoken MP Simon Danczuk, said Parliament needed people like her ‘to bring it back down to reality’. Scroll down for video . Selfie queen Karen Danczuk told LBC's Nick Ferrari (pictured) in Liverpool today that she aspired to be an MP – insisting she could relate to ordinary women unlike the current crop of female politicians . Mrs Danczuk, 31, who revealed earlier this year that she had suffered sexual abuse, told LBC’s Nick Ferrari that she had rebuilt her life after being ‘shattered’ as a child. She said she used provocative selfie pictures on Twitter as a way of saying to others: ‘I will not be ashamed about who I am.’ Mrs Danczuk said she had rebuilt her life after the abuse, but now had the confidence to go into politics. She said: ‘There’s not many women that can relate to women. The women we do have in politics – and I’m not being rude to them because they’re really, really good – are they relating to ordinary women? I think they could relate a bit more.’ Mrs Danczuk became a hit on Twitter after posting a series of provocative photos of herself. She now describes herself as the 'selfie queen' Mrs Danczuk, 31, who revealed earlier this year that she had suffered sexual abuse, told LBC’s Nick Ferrari that she had rebuilt her life after being ‘shattered’ as a child . Ms Danczuk was asked if she would go into mainstream politics and replied: ‘Yeah, I would. I think in some ways women like me need to, to bring it back down to reality.’ The mother of two said she didn’t agree with the way women politicians always talked about female issue like childcare. She said: ‘I don’t necessarily think we should assume that because you’re a women, you should focus all your time and effort focussing on childcare. ‘Just speaking a language they understand – you know, dashing to do a school run, to then dash to the supermarket – just speaking about everyday problems.’ She said: ‘Women that I speak to, there’s just nothing there for them to relate to.’ Karen Danczuk, pictured outside Parliament last week, could find herself on the Commons benches with her husband . Mrs Danczuk, the Labour councillor and wife of MP Simon Danczuk, stopped for a drink at the Red Lion pub outside Parliament . Mrs Danczuk also spoke about the sex abuse abuse she suffered as a child and called for anyone who had gone through it to see a therapist. She said: ‘It shatters you – you trust no-one. You have nightmares. You can’t live a normal live.’ But she said therapy had helped. ‘I will not be ashamed about who I am. I used to be ashamed. If anyone says you shouldn’t wear low-cut tops – no, reclaiming your body is a part of the process of recovery. ‘Your body has been taken away from you – they take your body, you lose control of it. It’s not a good place to be.’ She said she used to have ‘horrific nightmares’ every night and couldn’t sleep. Mrs Danczuk said having therapy and ‘dealing with it’ had transformed her life. ‘I don’t think I’m God’s gift to man, but I just have that confidence back because I’ve took control of my life – because that’s what therapy does.’ She said selfies were important to her because they allowed her to be herself. ‘It’s just been happy with you. Selfies are a reflection of saying “this is me, take me as I am”. ‘This is me taking a selfie – anyone saying don’t do it, I say just don’t look because this is me.’","Karen Danczuk said MPs needed to speak in a language people understood .

"A Missouri woman who finished a St. Louis marathon third last year and was the female winner of it this year is being stripped of the title after officials concluded she didn't run the full course either year. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that officials determined that Kendall Schler crept onto the GO! St. Louis Marathon's course last weekend after the last checkpoint, didn't record any of her times electronically along the way, and didn't run the entire 26.2 miles. Schler was spotted at the beginning of the race and the end of the race, and while Schler's actual course is unknown, the starting point of the race are suspiciously just three blocks apart. Scroll down for video . Fake winner: Kendall Schler cheated her way to the front of the St. Louis marathon course . Not a true winner: Her times that qualified her to run in Monday's Boston Marathon have now been erased, and her spot in the event has been vacated . Kendall Schler crept onto the marathon course after the last checkpoint and since she was spotted  at the starting point of the race just blocks from finish line, she may have lingered in that area before sneaking in . Schler claims to have removed both the magnetic strips meant to record her times from her race (violation of race protocol) and since no photographs of her were taken along the way there is no proof she is the rightful winner. Her finish time that qualified her to run in Monday's Boston Marathon has now been erased, and her spot in the event has been vacated. Her third-place finish last year also was wiped out after officials couldn't find evidence that she crossed any of that event's checkpoints. 'It’s a difficult situation for everybody, including the people who run a fair race and don’t get the recognition they should receive,' said Nancy Lieberman, president of GO! St. Louis. 'I said to her, ""It looks like you perpetrated a fraud.""' 'I have nothing legitimate that says she officially started and ran 26.2 miles in 2014 or 2015,' she added. Lieberman said incidents of dishonest runners happened but called this 'an extreme case.' When Lieberman made Schler prove she ran all of the checkpoints from last years race she was unable to provide them and he title was stripped from her. 'I said, ""I’m going to disqualify you in 2014 unless you provide me photos of you along the course,"" ' Lieberman said. 'I told her if she showed me photos within two hours I’d consider not disqualifying her.' Liar: Kendall Schler (left) was unable to prove that she won this year's marathon in St. Louis so Andrea Karl (right) was named this year's winner . Tough race: Runners return to St. Louis from E. St. Louis on the Martin Luther King Bridge during the race . The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that the course has seven spots where a runner is meant to record a time. The spots are the start, the finish, and five spots within the course. Lieberman said she did not register a time at any spot. There was no electronic evidence of any of those times either. According to the president of the marathon Nancy Leiberman, Schler claimed to have removed the magnetic strips from both of her race bibs. Tampering with race bibs is a violation of race protocol, says Leiberman. Lieberman checked with U.S. Track and Field officials on the course who also saw no sign of her. 'They’re situated in specific places so that people can’t cheat and jump on at other times,' Lieberman said. 'They didn’t see (Schler) anywhere on the course.' The true winner of the race was a woman named Angela Karl who Lieberman says didn't get the recognition that she deserved. 'There’s a euphoria the winner gets, breaking the tape and having the crowd cheer,' Lieberman said. 'The true winner did everything right and didn’t get her due.' Didn't get her cheer: 'There’s a euphoria the winner gets, breaking the tape and having the crowd cheer,' Lieberman said of the feeling of winning .","Kendall Schler crept onto the GO!

"We’ve all been there: you hear a catchy song and for days - or even weeks - on end you just can’t get it out of your head. Known as an earworm or brainworm, the effect has been studied before - but its cause, and how to get rid of it, is poorly understood. Now researchers say they have an answer; chewing gum after hearing a catchy song will help you think about it less often. Reading scientists say chewing gum helps you forget a song. In a study people were less likely to think about it when chewing (stock image shown). And they were a third less likely to 'hear' it when chewing gum. The results suggests same technique could stop other intrusive thoughts . The study was carried out by scientists at the University of Reading. In the research 98 volunteers were played the ‘catchy tunes’ Play Hard by David Guetta and Payphone by Maroon 5. - Recent music exposure . - Repeated music exposure . - Word triggers (eg. the word ‘faith’) - People triggers (where sight or memory of a person is associated with a song) - Situation trigger (eg. weddings can cause you to remember your own first dance song) - Stress . - Surprise . - Dreams . - Mind wandering . Over the next three minutes, they were then asked to hit a key every time they thought of the songs - while chewing gum, not chewing gum or tapping their finger. While chewing gum, volunteers reported thinking of the song less often than when they weren’t chewing gum, or when they were told to tap their finger instead. And chewing gum also reduced the amount they ‘heard’ the song in their minds by a third. The study is the first to examine the effects of chewing gum on earworms - and it suggests it could also be used to stop other unwanted or intrusive thoughts. ‘Interfering with our own “inner speech” through a more sophisticated version of the gum-chewing approach may work more widely,’ said Dr Phil Beaman, from the University’s School of Psychology and Clinical Language Sciences, who led the study. In the research 98 volunteers were played the ‘catchy tunes’ such as Play Hard by David Guetta and Payphone by Maroon 5 (pictured). Over the next three minutes, they were then asked to hit a key every time they thought of the songs - while chewing gum, not chewing gum or tapping their finger . While chewing gum, volunteers reported thinking of the song less often than when they weren’t chewing gum, or when they were told to tap their finger instead. And chewing gum also reduced the amount they ‘heard’ the song in their minds by a third (stock image shown) ‘However more research is needed to see whether this will help counter symptoms of obsessive-compulsive and similar disorders.’ In a previous study by the University of Reading in 2009, it was found that almost any song can become an earworm. A recent poll suggested over 90 per cent of the population experience them at least once a week with 15 per cent classifying their earworms as ‘disturbing’.","Reading scientists say chewing gum helps you forget a song .

"This is the chilling message a mother wrote on Facebook a day after allegedly abandoning her quadriplegic 21-year-old son in the Pennsylvania woods with just a blanket and a bible. 'I'm so happy,' Nyia Parler, 41, commented under a new picture of her cuddling her boyfriend on Tuesday. Just 24 hours earlier, police say she wheeled her care-dependent son into a park near their home in south west Philadelphia and left him there, before going to stay with her partner in Maryland. Relatives, who had been contacted by the boy's school when he didn't turn up to class on Tuesday, commented on Parler's picture, 'nyia call me asap,' and 'How the hell you happy?!? Call me!' On Sunday police said that Parler will be arrested as soon as she is released from hospital herself. Parler was admitted to a Maryland facility on Sunday for an 'undisclosed condition' and faces charges including aggravated assault, reckless endangering, neglect of a care-dependent person, kidnapping, unlawful restraint and false imprisonment, according to police in Pennsylvania. 'When her treatment is completed, we will take her to court and she can either waive or fight extradition,' Capt. Paul Starks of the Montgomery County, Maryland, police said in a statement. Chilling: This is the message Nyia Parler wrote on Facebook hours after she allegedly left her quadriplegic son alone in woodland with just a blanket and a bible. Relatives contacted by the boy's school frantically replied . Charged: Parler (right) was detained in Maryland on Saturday night, charged with assault and neglect. Police say she left her son on Monday to visit her boyfriend John Ferguson (left) in Montgomery County, Maryland . Horrific: The quadriplegic man was found here on the floor of a secluded woodland outside Philadelphia with this Bible and this blanket, 10 feet from his wheelchair. He'd allegedly been left there by his mother five days earlier . Parler left her son — who also has cerebral palsy — lying in leaves and covered with a blanket next to a wheelchair while she left town on a romantic getaway with her new boyfriend, John Ferguson, police said. He was found on Friday night near Cobbs Creek Park. Police believe he had been there for five days and the last time he and his mother were seen together was on Easter Sunday. She then boarded a bus to bisit Ferguson in Maryland, said Lt. John Walker of the Southwest Detectives Division. Walker said the victim was found around the corner from their home, and he described the scenario authorities believe to have taken place: 'She pushes him about 150 yards from the highway into the wooded area, takes him out of wheelchair, lays him on the ground, puts a blanket over him and leaves a Bible with him, and then just walks away.' During the period he was exposed to the elements, the young man was 'completely defenseless' in an area with wild animals, with no water and in cold, damp weather, Walker said. 'It's only by the grace of God that he survived this. Amazing,' he said. Reports claim relatives have been trying to obtain guardianship of the boy from Parler (pictured) for years . Contacted in Maryland after the young man's school became concerned about her absence, the victim's mother told relatives and authorities that he was with her, Walker said. 'Obviously her statements made during the week were not truthful,' he said. Her boyfriend, however, assumed other relatives were caring for the young man and 'was in shock when he learned what happened,' Walker said. A 16-year-old son also residing with the family is now in the care of other family relatives, Walker added. Walker said the son was hospitalized with dehydration, malnutrition, a deep cut on his back that caused concern about potential infection and possible eye injuries, but he appeared to be improving. 'He seemed to be a little happier yesterday,' Walker said. 'You could tell he knew his family was around and felt more comfortable. The 21-year-old, who is non-verbal and suffers from cerebral palsy, is now in Philadelphia Children's Hospital with his aunts, where he is being treated for dehydration and cuts to his back and eyes. Officials told NBC Philadelphia her son would have died if he hadn't been spotted by people walking along a nearby street. 'This kid is obviously a fighter. It's just unbelievable how we found him last night. It's just heartbreaking to see how another human, especially a mother, could treat him like that,' Lt. Walker of Philadelphia Police told ABC. Abandoned: A passerby noticed the 21-year-old here in a wooded Philadelphia park . The son was hospitalized with dehydration, malnutrition, a cut to his back and eye injuries. According to Philly.com two of his aunts, who are with him in hospital, have been trying to obtain guardianship for years. A neighbor, who declined to be identified, told DailyMail.com: 'She used to push him out to the school bus in his wheelchair, she seemed to care for him. Whenever I saw him, I saw her.' Another, who also wished to remain anonymous, said: 'I would see them outside together in the summer when he got home from school. Nothing looked wrong, I didn't suspect anything.' Walker said the son was exposed to the elements and other dangers. 'A lot of things could have happened out there,' he said. 'Obviously he's in the middle of a wooded area. You have wild animals there ... this kid could not defend himself. He does not function at all.' Walker added : 'What we've learned so far is that the 21-year-old child lives with his mother, completely dependent on mom as a result of his condition. 'She also has a 16-year-old son who is staying with other family members. 'We know she left for Maryland on Monday to go see her boyfriend on a bus.' The man had been reported missing from class at Philadelphia's School Of The Future on Monday. However, when a teacher called Parler she told them they were both in Maryland and he was well. Rescuers used flashlights to find the non-verbal in the East Lansdowne area of Philadelphia on Friday night .

"(CNN)So now the real trial is underway: What does the surviving Boston Marathon bomber, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, deserve and why?  What's he likely to get and why? Let's start where the penalty phase starts, with the prosecution's case. Prosecutors have listed, as they must, the aggravating circumstances that make this horrific mass murderer deserve the harshest punishment. The killing was ""heinous, cruel and depraved.""   He placed a bomb in a crowd, set it to kill and maim children and adults indiscriminately -- if that's not heinous, cruel and depraved, what is? Cruelty classically consists of a desire to cause pain and suffering in innocent victims, or, at the opposite extreme, it reflects a cold, callous indifference. Tsarnaev displayed both. Cruelty really provides us a lens into the worst of the worst of the worst. The number of dead from the bombing (three) and injured (260), including dozens maimed, also elevate these murders.  The victims were vulnerable -- no one more so than 8-year-old Martin Richard.  For 2,500 years, we have proclaimed that all human beings are equally valuable, yet we identify certain victims as especially worthy, and those who prey on them as especially culpable. The prosecution's emphasis: The killings involved ""substantial planning and premeditation"" and a betrayal of the United States -- the very country that gave Tsarnaev shelter and citizenship. And then there's the selection of the site, the Boston Marathon, an ""iconic"" event. And then there's Tsarnaev's lack of remorse -- opening day, the prosecutor's final shot of Tsarnaev locked up, giving the security camera the finger.  From his blood-scrawled justification in the boat after the bombing to this day, the message has been: Screw you, society. Tsarnaev may take the stand to beg for mercy, but only if he now feels or at least can fake remorse. And don't confuse regret with remorse.  No doubt Tsarnaev regrets his present predicament, regrets the negative publicity he's brought his friends and family and most poignantly regrets running over and killing his older brother while trying to escape.  But that's a far cry from genuine remorse for the victims he's killed and maimed. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was the lesser of two evils, the defense will insist over and over. Tamerlan was the source of his younger brother's malicious intent.  As the prisoners inside Washington D.C.'s now defunct Lorton Central Prison once described the street code to me:  No snitching, but if someone dies, then ""the dead guy did everything."" So the defense will claim that Dzhokhar was not fully responsible because he could not be.  After all, he was only 19.  Biologists teach us our brains don't fully develop until we're 25.  Thus, their argument goes, a 19-year-old simply can't be the worst of the worst. In 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the death penalty for those younger than 18 when they killed, repeatedly quoting an article by psychologists Laurence Steinberg and Elizabeth Scott.  But in the same article, these leading developmental psychologists themselves characterized it as an ""open question whether under real-world conditions the decision making of mid-adolescents is truly comparable with that of adults."" And they were talking about 17-year-olds. To the best of my knowledge, science has not and cannot establish a definitive connection between organic brain development and moral responsibility. Think about it:  When a 19-year-old bravely dashes into a burning building, risking his life to save children inside, we celebrate this heroism. We do not, nor should we, dismiss this bravery as the product of an impulsive not-yet-fully-formed personality.  If we can fully celebrate good character and heroic acts of our best young adults, why can't we fully condemn the cowardly viciousness of our worst? What outcome would I predict in the Tsarnaev case? Confronted by surviving victims and images of their dead loved ones, hearing offsetting pleas to ""move on,"" balancing the real suffering in the courtroom against the  imagined punishment of life that awaits Tsarnaev, I expect the jury will vote 10-2 (or 9-3) for death. But they must be unanimous for death; a lopsided but divided jury would result in a life sentence. Worse, the historical record and headlines in the next day's anti-death penalty news organizations will probably proclaim:  ""Jury Chooses Life for the Marathon Bomber"" -- even if overwhelmingly the people's representatives were to vote for death as the more appropriate punishment. Requiring a unanimous verdict for death gives the defense an enormous advantage -- one of many.  Why? Because in the end, we would much prefer that 1 or 10 or 20 convicted murderers who deserve to die instead live out their lives in the relatively nonpunitive condition of prison than one person who deserves to live be wrongly killed at the hands of the people. And yet, if we really commit ourselves to having the punishment fit the crime, if we rightly reserve the death penalty for the most heinous crimes and criminals, surely the Boston Marathon bomber stands among the worst of the worst.","Robert Blecker: In sentencing phase, the prosecution lays out wealth of evidence that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev deserves penalty reserved for the worst of the worst .
He predicts most of the jury will vote for a death sentence, but it must be unanimous; therefore, Tsarnaev will most likely get life in prison .",1b1b788f9a5f23b7a6d062863364035818accc4a

"All eyes were on John Terry this afternoon as he made the short trip across London to face QPR in the west London derby. Loftus Road was the place where the Chelsea skipper racially abused then QPR defender Anton Ferdinand in October 2011. Ferdinand's brother Rio was injured for Sunday's match. Terry, who has been a crucial part of Jose Mourinho's Premier League title bid this season, played the full 90 minutes however as Chelsea scraped a 1-0 win, but how did he get on... John Terry (centre) celebrates at the final whistle with Didier Drogba (left) and Branislav Ivanovic . Reception . There was a hostile introduction for Terry as the teams lined up, before a cacophony of boos rang out around the ground as he touched the ball in the opening minute. There was, however, no noticeable reaction from any of Chris Ramsey's players until Charlie Austin made himself known to the centre-back late in the first half with a robust challenge. Terry experienced a hostile atmosphere at Loftus Road, but put in a good display at the back for Chelsea . Temperament . It was a moment to cherish for the QPR fans as Austin responded to an arm across the chest by shoving Terry to the ground off the ball. The Chelsea skipper momentarily lost his cool and berated the assistant referee to the delight of the crowd. His battle with the striker continued into the second half, with the pair taken aside for a word after squaring up to each other but it was Terry who had the last laugh as Cesc Fabregas' late equaliser sealed three points. The Chelsea captain rises above Bobby Zamora to head the ball away as he dominated at the back . Performance . The former England captain was rarely troubled by Bobby Zamora and Charlie Austin. Although the pair were prominent throughout, a lack of pace meant Terry and partner Gary Cahill were able to deal with everything thrown at them even though they were bailed out by Thibaut Cortouis at times. There was a nervy moment in the first half when a long ball over the top caught out the 34-year-old, and he was lucky his misjudged touch didn't cost the side as Cahill covered, but it was a fairly comfortable day for the defender. The Chelsea captain was made to stretch occasionally, but he and Gary Cahil dealt with QPR's threat well . Conduct . Despite an obvious attempt from Austin to get under the skin of Terry, he largely ignored the attention surrounding him and focused solely on leading his side to an important win while handling the occasion with maturity. There were wild celebrations from Terry at the final whistle as he responded to the constant jeers. Terry's combative encounter with Charlie Austin attracted the attention of referee Andre Marriner .","John Terry racially abused Anton Ferdinand at the ground in October 2011 .

"In a retweet on Thursday, a staffer to real estate magnate Donald Trump managed to capture the coarsest background conversations Americans are having about former secretary of state Hillary Clinton's personal baggage. He may now be looking for a new job. 'If Hillary Clinton can't satisfy her husband,' a Texas-cowgirl college student tweeted, 'what makes her think she can satisfy America?' When someone retweeted the quip two hours later and included Trump's Twitter handle in the message, one of the billionaire's staffers retweeted it for him – to his audience of 2.8 million people. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . THE INTERNET IS FOREVER: A social media staffer to Donald Trump retweeted an off-color jab at Hillary Clinton on Thursday before the boss deleted it . Trump, a multibillionaire who's considering a presidential run, will be in New Hampshire on Saturday – where the episode will likely come up . SATISFIED? Bill Clinton (left) was a famous lothario during his presidency, even carrying on one affair with a White House intern . Time elapsed: Less than three hours. His office confirmed on Friday that it was a Trump employee, not a fat-fingered CEO, who was responsible. 'Mr. Trump was not responsible for this tweet,' a spokesperson told Daily Mail Online. 'It was retweeted by one of ten staff members that periodically help execute on Mr. Trump’s various social media platforms.' 'As soon as Mr. Trump saw the tweet he deleted it,' the spokesperson added. Hillary Clinton's once-strained relationship with her philandering husband isn't likely to be the stuff of TV ads in the 2016 presidential race, but the tweet suggests an undercurrent of crude jokes are being made at her expense. Sawyer Burmeister, a Texas equestrian champion, originated the line about Hillary Clinton's alleged inability to 'satisfy' her randy husband Bill . Bill Clinton, the 42nd U.S. president, had an affair with a White House intern named Monica Lewinsky. He also famously caroused with other women who were not his wife, going back to his days as the governor of Arkansas. A recent book about the staff who run the White House residence recounted a butler's story about hearing HIllary throw an object at him during the height of the Lewinsky saga. Taylor Burmeister, who wrote the tweet about Hillary failing to satisfy Bill, deleted it just before noon on Friday, along with a second message. 'Sry to those offended by me merely making a political joke,' she had tweeted in a follow-up. 'Get some rest, there are more important things in the world to be worried about.' She assured Daily Mail Online in an email that no one fro, the Trump camp had asked her to delete the tweets. 'I deleted them by choice because of the negative backlash I was receiving,' she said. 'I didn't even know Donald Trump had retweeted it until about an hour ago.' Burmeister confirmed to Daily Mail Online that she had deleted her tweets because of a nasty backlash . She originally offered an apology to people who were offended, but it apparently wasn't enough for some . Burmeister is no stranger to media attention. A world champion equestrian, she also had a bit part last year in an episode of the reboot of the 'Dallas' TV drama. And she's a pre-law student studying criminal justice at Tarleton State University in Texas, according to her social media profiles. Trump's retweet might have disappeared if a snarky Twitter user hadn't made a screen capture on his phone. 'Hey @RealDonaldTrump – In case you're looking for that tweet you deleted,' he wrote, 'I got it right here.' Hillary Clinton's campaign did not respond to requests for comment.","Sawyer Burmeister, a horse-riding champion and sometimes actress, tweeted the barb on Thursday evening .

"All well and good having Brazilians in your team but they have to be the right ones – Barcelona reached the Champions League semi-finals at the Nou Camp at Paris Saint Germain’s expense and Neymar tied David Luiz in knots in the process. There were no Luis Suarez nutmegs this time but the former Chelsea defender found himself backpedaling hopelessly on the quarter hour as Neymar scooted past him for Barcelona’s opener. Neymar (top) celebrates with Brazilian compatriot Dani Alves after scoring his and Barcelona's second goal of the night . Neymar accelerates past another Brazil teammate, David Luiz, before opening the scoring for Barcelona on Tuesday night . Barcelona: Ter Stegen 6.5; Dani Alves 7.5, Pique 5, Mascherano 6, Jordi Alba 6; Rakitic 7.5, Busquets 7 (Sergi Roberto 55, 6), Iniesta 9 (Xavi 45, 6.5); Messi 6.5, Suarez 6.5 (Pedro 75, 6), Neymar 9. Subs not used: Bravo, Bartra, Adriano, Rafinha. Goals: Neymar 14, 34. PSG: Sirigu 6; Van der Wiel 3.5, Marquinhos 4.5, Luiz 5, Maxwell 6; Verratti 6, Cabaye 4 (Lucas Moura 66, 6.5), Matuidi 6 (Rabiot 80, 6); Cavani 4 (Lavezzi 80, 6.5), Ibrahimovic 4.5, Pastore 3. Subs not used: Douchez, Camara, Digne,  Bahebeck. Booked: Luiz. Referee: Svein Oddvar Moen (Norway) He was then a spectator on the half hour when his international team-mate got the second climbing unmarked to head Dani Alves’ cross past Salvatore Sirigu to make it 5-1 on aggregate. PSG’s soft centre cost them in the first leg and it was cruelly exposed again. Luiz was also booked inside the first five minutes for a foul on Andres Iniesta, who ran the first half. The man who won the World Cup for Spain but is these days criticised for neither scoring nor assisting went on a sublime run for the first goal, pulling away from Edinson Cavani and swerving past Marco Verratti before releasing Neymar. The French champions thought they were back in the game between the two Barcelona goals when on 17 minutes Zlatan Ibrahimovic had the ball in the net but he was a yard offside when Blaise Matuidi slipped him through and the flag was raised to rule out the goal. The Swede was jeered by Barcelona supporters in the early stages as was former Barcelona defender Maxwell but such was Barca’s dominance that home fans eased up on the light-hearted abuse. Suarez and Messi were also impressive in the first half and Alves looked like a man trying to impress a potential employer. PSG could still be a possible destination for him beyond the end of this season. He tested Sirigu from distance before his assist for Neymar’s second. With Suarez and Alves snapping into challenges and Iniesta and Neymar providing the finesse Barcelona were completely dominant – to the extent that for once Messi was not their most impressive performer. The home side eased up after the break and PSG breathed more easily without ever threatening to get back into the tie. Rakitic saw his shot saved and Messi went close with chip that Sirigu gathered.

Great Britain's tennis No 1 Andy Murray (left) was at the Nou Camp alongside his friend and former tennis player Ross Hutchins . PSG did force a save from Marc-Andre Ter Stegen 10 minutes into the second half when Ibrahimovic tried his luck from distance but the German keeper who has watched Claudio Bravo not put a foot wrong in the league all season gave another faultless display. Missing the domestic campaign has been tough but a final appearance in Berlin would be some consolation. Luis Enrique’s side were so comfortable at half-time Xavi replaced the impeccable Iniesta at the break. And it wasn’t long before Busquets and Suarez were also given early cuts. Barcelona still have a league to win and play the Catalan derby against Espanyol this weekend with sill just a narrow two point lead over Real Madrid. Iniesta had done enough in 45 minutes of football to not need to come out after half time. His performance and at times Barca’s was a throwback to some of their best football under Pep Guardiola when the won this completion in both 2009 and 2011. Iniesta was in sensational form for Barcelona before replaced at half time by veteran midfielder Xavi . Barcelona's captain had been criticised earlier this season for a lack of goals and assists but he looks to be back to his best . Guardiola was the name on most supporters lips at half time as news filtered through that Bayern were mauling Porto and were also heading for the semi-finals. The prospect of Barcelona and Bayern being drawn together on Thursday is mouth-watering. Although perhaps on current form, and in view of his side’s injuries, Guardiola might prefer to leave the reunions for Berlin on June 6.

"As America's elite crime investigators they are more used to tackling crime. But now FBI agents have been told they have to new enemy to battle -- calories. Expanding waistlines and lack of mobility for many agents has led to the introduction of a compulsory fitness tests. Those who fail will have the marks noted on their annual performance review and could lead to being moved from assignments that involve physical activity. Compulsory fitness tests have been introduced for all FBI agents following fears over expanding waistlines . FBI chief James Coney has introduced the tests amid fears his 135,000 agents are slipping behind when it comes to personal fitness. He said the force depends on its agents ability to 'run, fight and shoot'. Coney also said he wants the people to take one look at an agent think 'there goes a special agent of the FBI' rather than a derogatory remark about being overweight. Police in America are often parodied for their love of doughnuts and few forces have any weight restrictions. New recruits to the FBI have to take a physical test but for the last 16 years have not had to undergo any other fitness exam. As part of the annual test agents aged under 30 will have to run a mile in twelve and half minutes and sprint 300 metres in 59 seconds. They will also have to perform 24 push ups without stopping and 35 sit ups in a minute. Some agents have complained about the five minute break between the exercises as they struggle to catch their breath. FBI chief James Coney said the force depends on its agents' ability to 'run, fight and shoot' Older agents are given slightly longer times to perform the tests. A man in his 50s is allowed 15.14m for the mile run and 83 seconds for the sprint. The Federal Bureau of Investigation's 12,000 female agents must also take the test. According to the New York Times, who obtained an internal memo from Coney about the fitness tests, few agents have rushed to meet the October deadline to complete the physical. In the Washington DC office only 75 out of the 800 agents have taken the test. The introduction of the tests comes as America is grappling with an obesity problem with a third of adults deemed obese or overweight. Figures from the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention show that almost 80million adults are obese and the cause of death of more than 120,000 people a year. First Lady Michelle Obama has been at the forefront of tackling child obesity with a nationwide 'Let's Move' campaign urging children to get more exercise. The cost to the health care system treating people with illness caused by overeating such as strokes and heart attacks has been put at $98billion a year. The concern about the fitness of FBI agents began after the 9/11 terror attacks when the agency switched its main mission from catching criminals to fighting terrorism. Rather than taking part in arrests, often involving chasing criminals, they would spend hours sat behind a desk. Much of their work now involves cyber crime and intelligence gathering which mostly involves desk work and little exercise. 'You could see that health and fitness were not the priority it used to be,' said Zachary Lowe, the chief of physical instruction at the FBI HQ in Quantico, Virginia. Much of the FBI's work now involves cyber crime and intelligence gathering which mostly involves desk work and little exercise - hence the new drive to get fit . FBI chief Comey, who took over in 2013, discovered on touring field offices that morale was low. He also notes that many agents didn't look as if they would be able to pass the physical exam they had taken on joining the force. His new regime has led to many calling the agency the 'Fit Bureau of Investigation.' J Edgar Hoover, the famed first director of the FBI, had made fitness tests compulsory while he was in charge. Its current director said the lives of people they protect depend on agents fitness and health and they were symbols of what is 'right and good' about the US. He said: 'The lives of your colleagues and those you protect may well depend upon your ability to run, fight and shoot, no matter what job you hold. 'I want you to look like the squared away object of that reverence. I want the American people to be able to take one glance at you and think ""THERE is a special agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"".'","Compulsory fitness tests introduced thanks to expanding waistlines .

"You won’t find it written down anywhere in black and white yet it remains one of the unseen by-laws of the game: until such time as an almighty mess is sitting squarely on FIFA’s front step, the governing body chooses to keep the door bolted firmly shut. Rows over goal-line technology were hardly something new when Frank Lampard’s infamous ‘ghost’ goal against Germany in the 2010 World Cup finally brought matters to a head. The 2000 Africa Cup of Nations Final between Nigeria and Cameroon had already been scarred by a similar howler while the world watched agog five years later as a Pedro Mendez effort which crossed the line at Old Trafford was incredibly missed by all the officials despite keeper Roy Carroll ending up tangled in the rigging. Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths has a goal-bound shot blocked by the outstretched arm of Josh Meekings . Such was the hullabaloo over the incident involving the Portuguese star that FIFA did, in fact, begrudgingly make some noises about trialling goal-line systems but it was no more than platitudes to appease the masses. It took Lampard’s ruled-out effort in Bloemfontein – with the ball being clearly a yard over Manuel Neuer’s line in the last-16 match – for the dam to finally burst. Despite initially shrugging off calls for the adoption of goal-line technology to be approved, FIFA relented two years later with the system fully operational last year in Brazil. The lesson for Scottish football fans still bemused by events at Hampden Park on Sunday when the officials failed to spot a potentially game-changing handball? Perhaps only when such an outrage occurs in the World Cup in Russia in three years’ time will common sense prevail. For those who believe the SFA are intransigent to football embracing the kind of video technology that would have seen Josh Meekings red carded and Celtic awarded a penalty in the Scottish Cup semi-final, here’s some news… . In February, the International Football Board – the SFA, FA, Irish FA, Welsh FA and FIFA – gathered in Belfast supposedly to discuss the possibility of approving trials. Before the meeting, FA representative David Gill made no bones about his association’s stance. Griffiths heads the ball, which is deflected clearly off the hand of Inverness' Josh Meekings (left) on Sunday . ‘We can’t live in the past,’ he stated. ‘Greg Dyke the (FA chairman) has come out and said he embraces it, and I think in certain circumstances I would look at it. We’ve got to move forward. The game is getting much quicker. ‘The TV coverage, you know, 28, 30 cameras a game. Everything is replayed, replayed. So how do we use that? My personal view is yes, sensibly, but it needs to be done in a manner that doesn’t detract from the fast-paced, quick action of football.’ Despite cases also being forwarded by the SFA and Irish FA to at least take the matter further, FIFA, aided by a sceptical Welsh representative, simply kicked the matter into the long grass. It won’t be discussed again for at least another year now with the inevitable injustices far enough off the radar in the interim. ‘It’s a question of making the biggest decision ever in the way football is played,’ said FIFA’s secretary general Jerome Valcke by way of an explanation for its rejection afterwards. While that may well be the case, procrastinating on the issue is hardly likely to resolve it. Injustices like those that almost certainly cost Celtic a place in the Scottish Cup Final on Sunday are hardly a rarity in the global game. Celtic captain Scott Brown (left) has words with referee Steven McLean during the Scottish Cup semi-final . Yet, until such time as one directly affects the outcome of a World Cup match involving one of the game’s heavyweights, they seem set to remain an ugly, unsatisfying feature of the landscape. To the great embarrassment of Michel Platini, the stationing of additional officials behind both goals has proved to be an extraordinary waste of time. Seemingly less reluctant to get involved than traditional linesman, ‘additional assistant referees’ - to give them their Sunday names - have seemed utterly superfluous since they were first trialled in the 2009-10 Europa League. On Sunday, Alan Muir, the official behind the goal, should have had a clear view of Meekings’ handball. But for reasons best known to himself, he failed to advise referee Steven McLean on what seemed an inevitable course of action. It took the high-profile blunder that denied Frank Lampard in 2010 to shift FIFA on goal-line tecnhology . ‘I knew it was a penalty,’ said Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths. ‘I think everyone in the ground knew it was a penalty. I asked the ref why he didn’t give the penalty and he said the assistant behind the goal said it hit him (Meekings) on the face.’ There is absolutely no excusing such crass incompetence. McLean and Muir should both have seen the handball with their own eyes and, even if one may have blinked at the wrong moment, assuredly one of them should have ensured the right call was made. That they didn’t is another blight on what’s been a desperate season for officiating in this country. Perhaps more than ever, the SFA now has good reason to press FIFA to at least road-test video technology. It’s hardly unchartered territory in sport. For those who prefer the oval ball game, a Television Match Official has been part of the fabric of rugby for 14 years now. No-one claims the system is perfect – decisions can often take longer to reach than they should - but few would dispute that it hasn’t enhanced the game because the right outcome is eventually arrived at. Lampard's disallowed goal forced FIFA to rethink, and Scottish fans must hope for a similar incident . Used only in first-class and international televised games, the TMO can only rule on exactly what the referee asks him. This usually involves, in try-scoring situations, whether a player’s foot has been in touch or to see if the ball has been properly grounded, but the TMO is also used to review if there has been dangerous or foul play. While the video review is normally conclusive, the snag – which is clearly a red flag for FIFA – is the time delay. At a recent Aviva Premiership match between Northampton Saints and Saracens, it took four minutes of review to award the winning try to the former while two other tries were disallowed. Edward Griffiths, the Saracens chief executive, later labelled the TMO process ‘a shambles’. ‘It’s almost make it up as you go along,’ Griffiths said. Indeed, rugby’s growing concern over the effect the TMO is having on the sport has led to Hawk-Eye, the ball-tracking technology company, to hold talks with the International Rugby Board about providing a replacement to the current system. Rugby's TMO may not be perfect, but it has shown that the game is better for use of technology . Hawk-Eye, which is already used in cricket, tennis and for goal-line decisions in football, says it can provide information for decisions within a few seconds by synchronising cameras from multiple angles. Paul Hawkins, the founder of Hawk-Eye, said: ‘Our system is a much cleverer way of looking at incidents. In Aussie Rules, we have halved the average time for decisions to be made.’ It can be assumed that, were FIFA to give tacit approval to video technology, Hawk-Eye would have just the programme to fit the bill. Using it sparingly would maintain the rhythm of football whilst ensuring that the 17 Laws of the Game are correctly applied. For football, the answers are already out there. If only someone would first ask the questions.","Celtic were denied place in Scottish Cup final by shocking decision .

"A transgender woman who had her face horribly damaged after it was injected with cement and tire sealant stepped out on Sunday showing off a new look. Rajee Narinesingh was one of the victims of 'toxic tush' doctor Oneal Ron Morris, who performed illegal plastic surgeries using substances such as Fix-a-Flat, Super Glue and mineral oil. Rajee had Morris inject her cheeks, lips and chin back in 2005, and ended up disfigured after she did not have the money to go to a proper cosmetic surgeon. Scroll down for videos . Rajee Narinesingh (above), one of the victims of 'toxic tush' doctor Oneal Ron Morris, stepped out showing her new face over the weekend . Rajee was recently treated by Dr Terry Dubrow and Dr Paul Nassif in a process that will be featured on the premiere episode of Botched . Left with a 'hard-as-rock' face, Rajee began seeing Dr John Martin of Coral Gables Cosmetic Reconstructive Surgery in 2012, who gave her softening injections and laser therapy to treat the botched surgery. In a 2014 interview she said that her new look was helping to boost her self-esteem, and that men were taking notice. 'Recently this guy said that being with me is like being with a sexy dragon,' she said at the time. 'I didn't know whether to slap him or kiss him.' Now, she has had her look improved once again by Dr Terry Dubrow and Dr Paul Nassif, a process that will be featured on the premiere episode of Botched. Rajee, who was born in New York but grew up in Philadelphia, explained when she realized she was a woman in that 2014 interview. She explained; 'Up until I was in my mid-twenties I just thought I was a feminine gay male. I thought about all the things I did when I was growing up - like taking the basketball my dad had bought me and instead of playing basketball with it I was simulating pregnancy and actually pretending to give birth and be a mommy. 'When I used to fantasize about being with guys I used to always picture myself with breasts and a vagina. I didn't realize I was doing it, it was just so natural for me. One day I just connected all the dots and thought ""you're not gay, you're transgender.""' Rajee lived in solitude and was afraid to go out after her face was left disfigured (above) That all changed in 2012 when she began receiving free treatments from Dr John Martin . Rajee, who had been too 'embarrassed and ashamed' to go to the authorities, claims she paid just $100 per session to Morris for the life-changing injections back in 2005. 'The last thing I wanted was to look like a man in a dress. I wanted to be a beautiful woman,' she said of her decision to get the injections. 'If you really want to live your authentic self as a woman you need to do some sort of face and body reconstruction. 'So I made the choice to get injections done. In our community it is called pumping.' And while she knew she was not seeing a licensed surgeon, she was still excited the day she went to see Morris. 'When it finally came to the day, I was more excited than nervous because I was finally going to be the woman I had always wanted to be,' she said. 'There was a room that she had set up where she did a lot of medical procedures.' The room looked sterile and clean she said, and sokn after she arrived they began the procedure. 'I got injections in my face and my hips and my buttocks and initially I was fine,' said Rajee. 'But then the nightmare started.' 'The last thing I wanted was to look like a man in a dress. I wanted to be a beautiful woman,' Rajee (above) said of her decision to get the injections. Oneal Ron Morris (above, file photo) is accused of leaving women ill and disfigured after injecting them with a mixture of toxic substances, including super glue and Fix-A-Flat . She was left with a large boil on her face that kept growing bigger and bigger, and then 'green pus exploded out of my face and onto the mirror. It was green and yellow and mixed with blood.' She ended up spending years in solitude as a result of these botched procedures, until Dr Martin agreed to help her for free. Because of him, she says she has gone from 'victim to victorious.' She is also ready to start dating again, saying; 'I definitely deserve more than just the 3 o'clock in the morning knock on the window.' As for Morris, she is now facing manslaughter charges after one of her patients died following a procedure.","Rajee Narinesingh, one of the victims of 'toxic tush doctor 'Oneal Ron Morris, stepped out showing her new face over the weekend .

"'Secret stuff': Ivana Chubbuck, 62, is a part therapist and part acting coach, known as the 'celebrity whisperer' She is known as the 'celebrity whisperer', a woman whose astonishing skill in honing Hollywood talent made an icon out of a man who used to stand on street corners dressed as a chicken. Today, Brad Pitt is known the world over. Ivana Chubbuck's client list includes Eva Mendes, Charlize Theron, Gerard Butler, Halle Berry, Sharon Stone and many others. So powerful are her methods, she reduced Beyoncé Knowles to tears within five minutes. And within months, the singer was topping the charts with Single Ladies. Part therapist, part acting coach, and very Hollywood, Chubbuck, 62, runs a hugely successful drama school in Los Angeles. She hosts workshops around the globe, as well as in the wood-panelled library of her £3 million home. Beyoncé went to Chubbuck when she was about to play legendary soul singer Etta James in the movie Cadillac Records and was looking to be taken seriously as an artist. Despite her professional success, Beyoncé was also at what she termed 'a pivotal point' in her life. 'I'm about empowering people,' Chubbuck told The Mail on Sunday in a rare interview – one which goes much further into her methods, and her clients' responses, than she usually allows. 'Beyoncé is a black girl from the South, that is her world. Like everyone else on the planet, she has issues. But once she faced those issues and realised she could use them in a positive way in her art, she flourished.' Apparently it's all about the 'secret stuff' that Chubbuck's clients tell her. Certainly it is well known that Beyoncé's relationship with her domineering father has been fractured for years. 'I told her to open up, to really get in touch with her feelings and what was going on inside her,' Chubbuck said. 'She started to feel her secret stuff and we start having a dialogue about it and she became emotional. We were crying together. She tapped into that well of pain inside her. 'She rang me up after we'd worked together on the movie and said, 'Listen to my new record – it's all the stuff you taught me.' And that's when she came out with Single Ladies and all the great female empowerment songs. The little pop star turned into a global icon.' When we meet at Chubbuck's home, model and actress Eva Mendes is just leaving after a three-hour 'intensive session' for her new movie with Ricky Gervais called Special Correspondents. Clients: Chubbuck works with some of the biggest names in show business including Beyonce (left) and Eva Mendes (right) Eva's Prada dress in pale orange . Shop the designer at Saks Fifth Avenue! Visit site . Esmeralda! We LOVE it. And we've a feeling little Esmeralda might be a little style icon in the making, just like her mum. So what that in mind, it's time to revisit one of our favourite Eva Mendes looks. This woman can wear what she likes. Even in bold shades of orange she still manages to look flawless, which is why we've decided to take some autumnal inspiration from this premiere perfect look. She wore this orange Prada dress back in March of 2013, but we still can't quite get over it. It's floaty, feminine and gorgeous. Eva teamed this orange number with a lighter hue satin shoe, which added another texture and dimension to the look. We would definitely suggest a strappy, metallic heel with this. So, if you're keen to update her look for the new season, check out our pick of the best colour-popping dresses (below). We'll be donning Mango's layered mini dress with a leather biker jacket to see out the summer in style. Mango Chiffon Ruffle Dress . Visit site . Boohoo Laura Curve Column Dress . Visit site . Bec & Bridge Isis Angle Dress (now on sale for $178!) at Revolve . Visit site . Carven Crêpe de Chine Dress at Barneys . Visit site . So what did that amount to? Mendes said: 'Ivana's technique could be boiled down to: take the pain in your life and find the most effective way to accomplish a goal with it.' In other words, your guess is as good as mine. Mendes continues: 'It helps you understand humanity – what drives someone to do what they do, good or bad. It's not painful… it's cathartic.' Chubbuck first met Brad Pitt when he was working as a promoter for a fast-food restaurant dressed in a chicken suit, and tells a story of a young man so driven by a desire to succeed that he had no life aside from acting. Today, he is still a client and Chubbuck worked on his most recent movie, Fury. She made an icon out of Brad Pitt, who when she met him was working as a promoter at a fast-food restaurant dressed in a chicken suit . 'Brad always had a work ethic that put others to shame,' Chubbuck said. 'He studied and worked. I would pair him up with a partner and many of those partners would ask to be changed because Brad wanted to rehearse a scene three, four, five hours a day. He was dedicated to his craft. He had no social life. He had his stupid job and the rest of the time he was studying with me. 'For the major talents, fame is never the driving force. Brad worked his butt off, he's taken risks over the years and when he fails he gets back up and works harder. He makes bold choices and isn't afraid to fail.' So what is the secret? Chubbuck says her technique is based on delving into your 'deepest, darkest past' and then using those negative feelings to positively portray a character on screen. Some of this is outlined in a best-selling book The Power Of The Actor (Gotham Books) which has been translated into 18 languages. Stars such as Kate Bosworth, Camilla Belle, Elisabeth Shue and Mendes have given the tome glowing reviews. Mendes said: 'It is my bible – I don't leave home without it.' Chubbuck recently returned from a working trip to London and says the phenomenon of British actors dominating Hollywood (Eddie Redmayne, Benedict Cumberbatch, Daniel Craig) is 'because Brits have a great work ethic and are not afraid to take risks or make fun of themselves'. Do her celebrity friends such as Matthew Perry, James Franco and Jake Gyllenhaal ever expect star treatment? 'Bottom line is they are with me to work,' Chubbuck says. 'Celebrity goes out the window. I'm about stripping them bare. The one thing I have learned over the years is that all of us have the same needs and wants as human beings. 'It doesn't matter if you are in London or the Philippines. There's a shared human story – we all want love, we all have issues with our spouses or partners, with our parents. The key thing is taking the bad stuff and not being a victim. 'You have to use that stuff to empower yourself.'","Ivana Chubbuck, 62, is known as the 'celebrity whisperer' and hones talent .

"Not a single Labour candidate questioned by a major polling company mentioned the deficit as being one of the biggest issues facing Britain. Ipsos Mori interviewed almost 100 candidates from the major parties, asking them what they thought the most important issues facing the country were. Not one Labour candidate listed the government spending or the deficit; compared to 35 per cent of Tory candidates. In an IpsosMori survey of people standing for election, not one of Ed Miliband's Labour candidates named the deficit as an important issue facing the country . 35 per cent of Tories mentioned the deficit, 5% of Lib Dems and 9 per cent of those surveyed standing for the Scottish National Party . Among the Liberal Democrats, 5 per cent mentioned the deficit as an issue; and even among the left-wing SNP, it was brought up by 9 per cent of candidates. The omission recalls Ed Miliband’s embarrassing gaffe in which he completely forgot an entire passage about the deficit from his conference speech last year. The issue of Britain’s relationship with the EU was also not mentioned by a single Labour candidate. Unlike David Cameron, Mr Miliband is not pledging any renegotiation of powers or a referendum on EU membership. Pollsters from Ipsos Mori asked 98 candidates to list what they thought were the biggest issues. They could mention anything they liked – there were no promptings. The top issue for all parties was the economy, mentioned by 85 per cent of Conservative and Lib Dem candidates but only 62 per cent of Labour ones. For Labour, the economy tied with health and the NHS as the main issue. It was mentioned by 62 per cent of candidates, compared with 65 per cent for the Lib Dems and 54 per cent of Tories. The next most important issues for Labour were ‘inequality’ (mentioned by 24 per cent of candidates), housing (21 per cent), and then jobs, immigration and education (all tied on 14 per cent). For Tory candidates, the third most important issue was spending and the deficit (35 per cent), jobs (31 per cent), education (27 per cent) and the relationship with the EU (19 per cent). No Conservative candidates mentioned inequality, housing or the impact of austerity. The economy and the NHS were the most frequently mentioned issues among the three main parties . Immigration, housing and international ties were the least likely to be mentioned by candidates . Austerity was the most important issue for the SNP (64 per cent), while surprisingly only 3 per cent of Labour candidates mentioned it. The survey, unveiled at a briefing by Ipsos Mori, was based on interviews with 98 candidates, including 26 Tories, 29 Labour and 20 Lib Dems. The briefing pointed out that the last time an opposition party was elected with an overall majority after just a single parliament out of office – the goal of Labour – was in 1931. It said that a leader had never been elected prime minister with such low ratings as Mr Miliband. But it also pointed out that the last time a governing party increased its votes hare after more than two years in office – the goal of Mr Cameron if the Tories are to govern alone – was 1955. Meanwhile Harriet Harman has admitted that drivers could be hit with a hike in fuel duty if Labour gets into power. The deputy Labour leader refused to rule out above inflation increases in taxes on fuel, alcohol, tobacco or air fares. Asked if the party would raise the levy on petrol, she told LBC: ‘We rule out increasing VAT, the basic or the higher rate of tax, we will put up the top rate of tax, we will not put up the national insurance rates. ‘For all the other taxes that there are – you know, airport taxes, I can’t remember what they are called, airport passenger duties, or alcohol duties or tobacco or petrol – we will lay that out in the Budget.’ It emerged that Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, had called for the scrapping of the Trident nuclear deterrent. The potential leadership contender suggested that Trident should be ‘the first to go in the round of public spending cuts to come after the general election’, according to a 2010 interview with Brixton Blog.","Poll of candidates asked them what were country's biggest challenges .

"A woman who is five months pregnant and was fired from her job at Popeyes after an armed robber made off with $400 on her shift says she has been offered her job. Only Marissa Holcomb isn't so sure she wants to go back to the fried chicken chain in Channelview, Texas. The mother-of-three was held at gunpoint on March 31, however she was fired when she refused to pay back the money that was stolen, with the store saying she should not have allowed so much cash to be in the till at one time. Now Popeyes have offered to take Holcomb back and have offered her $2,000 in backpay, since she has been out of work for almost one month. 'I do need a way to support my kids,' she told KHOU. '(But) I don't want to go back to a business where I'm treated the same and I just get pushed back out if something else happened.' Scroll down for video . Welcome back: Marissa Holcomb - who is five months pregnant with her fourth child - was fired from Popeyes after $400 was robbed from her till and she refused to pay it back. She has now been offered her job back, but is unsure whether to take it . Robbery: A man armed with a handgun and his concealed with a red beanie held up the Popeyes in Channelview, Texas, on March 31. Less than two days later Marissa Holcomb was fired . Hold up: The robber managed to get $400 cash from the till, which Popeyes said is too much money to have kept in the register. They said it is not the first time Holcomb had got in trouble for not clearing the till . Holcomb was left shaken by the incident, in which a man armed with a handgun and his face concealed with a red beanie jumped the counter and held the gun to her head, demanding money. Holcomb wasn't able to access the safes, so the robber made with the cash in the till - totaling $400. Her bosses said it was against there policy to have such an amount in the register and gave Holcomb an ultimatum - pay it back or lose her job. 'I just had a gun to me. I'm not paying the money,' Holcomb told KHOU earlier in the week. 'I don't think it's right because now I'm struggling for my family because what I had to do to keep my life. 'I mean who's gonna call me? I'm five months pregnant. 'The fact that I got robbed at gunpoint and it's like nobody cares.' Holcomb said she was fired less than two days after the incident. A Popeyes spokesman said it wasn't the first time Holcomb hadn't cleared the till. Marissa Holcomb, who is five months pregnant with her fourth child, was held at up at the fried chicken chain store in Channelview on March 31 and then fired because of it . The spokesman said that if Holcomb was given the opportunity to pay the money back they were not aware of such a situation. CEO Cheryl Bachelder then released a statement Wednesday evening, saying head office had 'reached out' to the owner of the Channelview store and asked him to 'apologize and rectify' the situation. Holcomb claimed she had done her job properly and that it was an extremely busy night. The chain were offering a popular two piece chicken special for $1.19 on the night of the robbery. 'They got what they got because that's what we made within one hour,' she said.

"For more than 2,000 years, invaders have been fighting over glorious Kefalonia. Romans, the Kingdom of Naples, the Venetian Republic, the Ottoman Empire, the French, British and, during the Second World War, the Italians and Germans have all left their mark. Fortunately, the present settlers - the Greeks themselves and the odd expat - have stoutly resisted the encroachment of mass tourism. So instead of fast-food restaurants you will find charming family-run tavernas that make this island a foodie heaven. Great forests of pines, cypress and cedars still sweep down the steep hillsides, often ending in cliffs of chalk as white as those at Dover, or in fine shingle and sand beaches, fringing a sea whose warm, sun-reflecting waters are of startling clarity. The famous curve of Myrtos beach, as well as many little inland villages, are seen on the road to Fiscardo . Inland, the roads, winding around mountains whose accessible slopes are swathed in olive groves and vineyards are blessedly free of excessive traffic. We landed at the island's only airport near the capital town of Argostoli, took a five-minute walk to the car-rental office and were quickly on our way to the village of Spartia on the southern coast - our first base of a two-centre holiday. Richard Johnson rejoices in unspoiled Kefalonia . We were staying first at the superb Villa Hephaestus. The view from our shady veranda was wonderful - indeed, my American wife called it 'awesome'. The sweep of Lourdas Bay, with its long sandy beaches, was spread out below us, while the neighbouring island of Zakynthos could be seen in the misty distance. Hephaestus is a modern villa with a well-equipped kitchen, and we love to cook. However, after a long day travelling, we decided we needed restorative cocktails, a carafe of white wine and a good fish dinner. Not fancying driving along twisting lanes, we called a taxi to take us to the beautifully situated and highly regarded Water Way restaurant at Spartia beach. The proprietor is a local fisherman, so the best of his catch goes to the kitchen, which is presided over by his wife, while his charming daughter Tepsi is in charge of front of house. From Lourdas Bay you can see Zakynthos Island, where the beautiful Shipwreck Beach (pictured) is found . A sweeping view across the turquoise waters of Lourdata Bay and the white stands of Lourdas Beach . The island is replete with diverse things to see on day trips but the nightlife is virtually non-existent, so we decided to stay home in the evenings and explore during the day. We checked out the string of beaches around Lourdas Bay and found plenty of good restaurants. At the top of a flight of easy steps from Lourdas beach, we found Lorraine's Magic Hill restaurant, with superb food lovingly prepared by the eponymous owner with ingredients from her husband's organic farm. The portions are generous and there's a great view across the bay to fellow Ionian isle Zakynthos. The popular Skala beach is just at the end of the bay. The Metaxa Beach Bar is a good place for coffee and the area is lined with tavernas. We shopped for supplies for our evening meals at Argostoli's port. One can buy catch-of-the-night fish straight from the boats that line the quay (park where you like, for free). The popular golden Skala beach is just at the end of the bay with the nearby Metaxa Beach Bar good for coffee . The town of Argostoli's port is ideal for picking up supplies, including catch-of-the-night fish  from the boats . Enjoyable excursions to the countryside took us to the ruined hilltop castle of St George, near Peratata, and the monastery of St Ayos. At both places entrance is free, and don't miss the Castle cafe just outside the gates. Its enthusiastic proprietors are Greek/English and serve superior food in a shady garden. The Monastery of Saint Geronimo is situated in a vine-clad valley north-east of the castle. It was rebuilt in Byzantine-style in the 1960s, the original having been destroyed during a 1953 earthquake. The walls of the interior are decorated in exuberant style with biblical scenes, and a huge candelabra hangs from the ceiling. We loved our stay in the south, but for the second week of our stay it was time to take the 35-mile drive to Fiscardo, on the island's north cape. The trip afforded superb views of the coast - including the famous curve of Myrtos beach - as well as many little inland villages. Fiscardo, once a remote fishing port, has been transformed into a world-class yachting centre, with smart restaurants and boutiques jostling for every inch of the quayside. The second week of our stay was a 35-mile drive away in the fishing village of Fiscardo , in the island's north . 'It's like St Tropez in the old days,' I mused. Our villa, Island View, is set on the hillside overlooking the port. From its verandas and infinity pool the neighbouring islands of Ithaca - mythical home of Odysseus - and Lefkas could be seen through the shimmering sea mist. We found some attractive beaches a few minutes' drive from Fiscardo. Our two favourites were Agia Jerusalem and Alaties, both reached by turning right out of the village of Maganos and following the signs. Agia Jerusalem is considered a 'secret' place, peaceful even in August. When we visited (in September), fewer than a dozen people were enjoying the sunbeds provided. Agia Jerusalem Beach is considered a 'secret' place, peaceful even in August, and a favourite of the writer . There's an excellent taverna, with fresh fish and dishes from a menu that changes daily. Alaties, on the other hand, is a tiny cove with a miniature beach. It's lovely to swim there. Among the fir trees above the beach is a modern restaurant where fresh prawns can be had. Apart from one afternoon of rain (we were on a boat trip to Lefkas but 30 minutes out of Fiscardo, an unexpected squall hit us and it rained for the remainder of the trip), the weather was perfect. We had a wonderful time with beautiful scenery, great food and fun when we wanted it. I can see why so many people have wanted to invade Kefalonia!","Visited Spartia in the south of Kefalonia and then Fiscardo, in the north .

"Down Augusta way they say the azaleas are in full bloom, which is more than can be said for England’s Justin Rose. A bruising Florida swing last month saw the Englishman fall outside the world’s top 10. For a player who has been virtually a fixture in the top five for the last three years it was certainly a dent to the ego, with the Masters now just around the corner. Rose’s solution to his miserable form — three missed cuts and a 55th-place finish at the Cadillac Championship in four PGA Tour starts — was the time-honoured one. For the past two weeks, the 34-year-old has spent long hours on the practice ground. Justin Rose hit 17 out of 18 greens in regulation and signed for a 69 at the Shell Houston Open . In the first round of the Shell Houston Open on Thursday there were encouraging signs his decline will prove temporary. Rose hit 17 out of 18 greens in regulation and signed for a 69, the same score as his playing partner, the ever- consistent Jordan Spieth. ‘It’s certainly a welcome return to the sixties, for it had been a while,’ said Rose, smiling. On a day when American Scott Piercy went round in 63 and Phil Mickelson enjoyed his best round in months with a 66, it was hardly surprising the only reporter waiting to talk to Rose was this one. But under the radar is never a bad place to be going to the Masters. The boom and bust years that characterised the first half of Rose’s career meant there was never going to be any feelings of panic following his unusually poor run in the Sunshine State. ‘There’s no doubt I lost my game there but the Florida swing can be unforgiving if you’re slightly off,’ he said. ‘Over the past two weeks I feel like I’ve done some good work and whether I finish well or not here I feel like I’m going in the right direction again. ‘Basically I was getting ahead of the ball at impact, and shots were going left or right, the irons were not solid and the new putter was not working. So we’ve corrected the faults and I’ve gone back to the old putter.’ Phil Mickelson enjoyed his best round in months with a 66 on Thursday . Does he pay much attention to the world rankings? ‘You notice, for sure,’ he said. ‘I’m very proud of the fact I’ve been in the world’s top five for practically the whole of the last three years. It’s a nice ego thing, so by the end of the year I’m hoping there won’t be any slippage. ‘But right now, I’ve got to focus on my game in the knowledge that the rankings change fast when you’re playing well. I’m in all the tournaments I want to be in, so there’s no need to worry on that score. Typically, your good years are built around four or five really good weeks, so you have to stay patient.’ He’d certainly love for one of those good weeks to be the next one. Rose paid a reconnaissance visit to Augusta last Monday and felt the same old thrill. ‘It’s such a treat to enjoy it when it is quiet, you still pinch yourself,’ he said. ‘I think if I’d had a crystal ball when I was 13 or 14 and it had said I’d get to play Augusta every year, I’d have been very happy with that.’ He’s certainly had his share of adventures during his nine appearances to date. Rose might be the only player in Masters history to have led or had a share of the lead after every round bar the last one. His best chance so far of finishing on top after 72 holes came in 2007, when he stood on the 17th hole tied for the lead only to run up a fatal double-bogey six. Paul Casey celebrated his last-gasp Masters invitation with two eagle threes in a fine round of 68 . ‘The Masters has probably been less on my mind this year because I am trying to find some form,’ he admitted. ‘But I think the fact I’ve had a number of great rounds there will always stand me in good stead. Regardless of what happens here, I feel comfortable on that course and know I can manage my game even if it’s not 100 per cent. You draw off the energy of the place.’ Mickelson has certainly done that over the years and perhaps the veteran lefty, a three-time Masters champion, is gearing himself up for another run at the green jacket. ‘It was a good start to the tournament and now I’m looking for three more good rounds,’ he said. 'This is a big week for me. I felt the game was close last week. The only thing missing was chipping and short game.' Paul Casey, like Mickelson another former winner of this event, celebrated his last-gasp Masters invitation with a fine round of 68 notable for two eagle threes. In the afternoon wave, Padraig Harrington and Lee Westwood both made good starts to play their first six holes in two under.","Justin Rose bounced back from Florida misery by carding 69 in Houston .

"There was no special treatment for Lewis Ferguson at Paul Nicholls’ yard on Thursday morning. The 18-year-old was mucking out the stables as usual, just a cut on the nose to show for the fall which has made him an internet sensation. Ferguson, whose double somersault horror fall from the favourite Merrion Square in the 4.20pm at Wincanton on Wednesday has been watched hundreds of thousands of times online. But he was back riding out and said he was undeterred from getting back in the sadal. ‘It was just a blur,’ he said, ‘I couldn’t work out what had happened until I got back to the weighing room and watched the replay. All the other jockeys asked me if I was alright and stuff, they all watched with me and looked away in horror. It’s about the most impressive fall I’ve seen.

But the vehicles returned to base just moments later when the caller revealed the 'victim' was actually a squirrel that had been run over in Epping Forest. The report forms just part of a long list released by East of England ambulance service detailing their most bizarre, and irritating, call outs. Two ambulances were sent to Epping Forest after a caller told crews 'someone' had been run down, only for the 'victim' to turn out to be a squirrel. Another man said he had dropped his burger and it was 'bleeding' Another came from reveller in Basildon, Essex, who said 'I've dropped my burger and it is bleeding', while a third woman in Chelmsford, dialled 999 to report 'I've eaten too much takeaway food.' The service said it receives around 2,500 calls per day, and in the last two years has had to deal with 1,248 that did not need emergency help. Front-line crews have attended almost half of the phoney calls, believing them to be genuine emergencies. Also on the list is a woman from  Shoeburyness who called to say she was locked out of the house, while a man in Peterborough called to say his feet hurt after wearing shoes that were too small. In Hitchin, Hertfordshire, a man told 999 staff: 'I have been dieting and feel lethargic.' Gary Morgan, Regional Head of Emergency Operations Centres, asked people to use common-sense when calling, adding that misguided or hoax calls could cost lives. East on England ambulance revealed the bizarre calls as part of a list of 1,248 inappropriate call outs, saying that crew attended half of them, potentially putting lives at risk (file image) He said: 'We're an emergency service and our front-line staff are trained to save lives. 'However, sadly, some of the calls we receive are not even medically related and we will refer hoax calls to the police. 'We prioritise all life-threatening calls to get the quickest possible response. 'However, that response can be affected if our call handlers and front-line staff are dealing with inappropriate 999 calls. 'We would strongly urge people who think it is funny to make a prank call to stop and think about the potential consequences.' In another strange call one woman phoned to say she felt ill after eating too much takeaway, while a man reported that his feet were hurting after wearing shoes that were too tight .","Woman reported 'someone' had been run over, but victim was a squirrel .

"A loving boyfriend has granted his girlfriend her birthday wish of having their wedding photographs taken - even though they can't officially get married yet because she is bedridden in hospital. Guo Kai and girlfriend Dong Hui, who turned 22 on Monday, had been planning to get married this month in Sichuan in southwest China.

"(CNN)Sunday's announcement that Corinthian Colleges Inc. would shut down all of its remaining 28 campuses is a positive development in a long struggle to hold for-profit colleges accountable. Corinthian, which once enrolled more than 70,000 students, is one of the worst of the ""predator colleges"" -- schools that offer dubious degrees, saddle students with high amounts of debt and gobble up tens of billions of dollars in federal money every year. Many of these schools are for-profit career colleges that operate mostly online. It's no wonder that Corinthian is doing this after the U.S. Department of Education curtailed its access to federal student aid last summer. There are about 1.3 million students enrolled in for-profit colleges, many of which have questionable track records, and their students need help transitioning into legitimate postsecondary schools. With Uncle Sam's student loan debt sheet topping $1 trillion, we literally can't afford to continue funding for-profit colleges -- which reportedly get 86% of their funding from federal student loan money. For those not familiar with the for-profit college fiasco, here's the whole story in one telling statistic: While for-profit colleges enroll only 13% of the nation's college students, such colleges account for nearly half of all student loan defaults, according to Department of Education statistics. For comparison's sake, the default rate of for-profit college students is worse than the default rate of the worst subprime borrowers during the financial crisis. How do these colleges operate? It's deviously simple: Convince low-income students into borrowing tens of thousands of dollars through easy federal student loans, keep costs low through online classes and part-time professors, and watch the money roll in. The aggressive tactics of these colleges boggle the mind. Recruiters are told to make 100 phone calls and leave 100 messages a day, according to a ProPublica investigation. I can personally attest to the aggressive tactics. My phone number was accidentally placed on a call list for a for-profit college recently, and I received so many calls per day that I had to ask my wireless carrier to block the phone number. Stopping the exploitation of students isn't easy. The for-profit college business is a multibillion-dollar industry. The CEOs of these companies make millions of dollars a year, employ an army of lobbyists and donate money to both political parties. But the past two months brought a new twist to the crisis. Hundreds of graduates of the now-defunct Corinthian joined a ""debt strike,"" publicly declaring their refusal to pay back their loans. In response, Education Department Secretary Arne Duncan signaled a willingness to forgive loans of Corinthian graduates who have crushing debt and no job prospects. Now that Corinthian is finally shutting down, we must finish the job. The remaining for-profit colleges should be closed. Any student not gainfully employed or transferred to a reputable college within three years should be considered a victim, and their debts should be forgiven. Yes, ""victim"" is the right word. If these degrees actually helped people get jobs, we should be celebrating them. But according to a jaw-dropping report by the Education Department, the average graduate of an online for-profit college makes less than a high school dropout. Not the equivalent of a high school dropout. Less than a high school dropout. The real-life misery caused by predatory colleges is painful to hear about. One Corinthian graduate has $37,000 in debt for his computer science degree, but he can't even get a job at Best Buy, according to Slate. Another graduate, $33,000 in debt, has a medical assisting degree, but she gave up on finding employment in her field. She waits tables now, The Chronicle of Higher Education says. I can already hear your next question. If for-profit colleges are this terrible, are they at least cheaper? No. In fact, their cost is reportedly around 60% higher than a comparable degree from a public college. What's even more frustrating is that we've known about the shenanigans of these predator colleges for years. A 2011 report by the Government Accountability Office found widespread rule breaking by the largest for-profit colleges -- everything from accepting fictitious high-school diplomas to encouraging plagiarism and cheating. In one example, an undercover federal investigator posing as a student was told by a professor, ""It's not hard to get a 100% on the second try; just jot down the correct answers and take the quiz again,"" according to The New York Times. In 2013, Career Education Corp. paid $10 million to settle charges by the state of New York regarding phony job-placement claims. All told, no fewer than 36 state attorneys general were investigating for-profit colleges in 2014. After selling off 95 of its campuses last year, Corinthian said on Sunday that it tried unsuccessfully to sell the remaining 28 campuses, blaming the failure on ""federal and state regulators seeking to impose financial penalties and conditions"" on potential buyers. You can't hide your bad behavior forever, and the questionable practices of many for-profit colleges are starting to catch up with them. Enrollment at the University of Phoenix -- the largest for-profit college in the United States -- has fallen by half, to about 213,000. We laid the smackdown on predatory lenders during the financial crisis, and it's time to do the same thing with for-profit colleges. To keep predator colleges from wrecking our faith in the college degree -- still the best pathway to a middle-class life -- we need to act now. For-profit colleges have flunked their final exam. Now it's up to their rich benefactor, Uncle Sam, to make sure they don't go back to school in the fall. Editor's Note: An earlier version of this article said the San Diego campus of the University of Phoenix had been banned from enrolling military veterans last year; that issue has been resolved.","David Wheeler: Corinthian, considered a ""predator"" school, will shut down campuses .

"Boston (CNN)The Boston Marathon is traditionally an event in which people in and around the Massachusetts capital come together, celebrate and enjoy. But not in 2013, when three people died and over 200 were injured when a pair of bombs went off within 12 seconds of each other at the finish line. And not this year -- at least not if you're a member of the jury that convicted Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in the bombings. That's what federal Judge George A. O'Toole told jurors Tuesday, stressing the importance of avoiding anything that could be prejudicial in the trial's sentencing phase. That begins April 21, a day after this year's edition of the landmark race. ""Do not attend the Boston Marathon or any events or gatherings related to the anniversary or the current running of the Boston Marathon,"" O'Toole said in court. The judge spoke for less than 10 minutes, and stressed the seriousness of his warnings. The first phase of Tsarnaev's trial began March 4, after which federal prosecutors called 92 witnesses, and the defense just four. Timeline of the bombings, manhunt and aftermath . Tsarnaev's lawyers never disputed that their client was at the scene of the bombings and part of the days-long mayhem that followed. Tsarnaev lawyer Judy Clarke acknowledged in opening arguments that: ""It was him."" But Clarke argued that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev only took part in the plot under the influence of his brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who died after the bombings, but before his brother was captured in a boat parked in a Watertown backyard, . That argument wasn't enough to sway the jury, though. Rather, they convicted Dzhokhar Tsarnaev on all 30 counts he faced -- including using weapons of mass destruction, bombing a place of public use, conspiracy and aiding and abetting. A look at all of the charges . The only question now, short of a successful appeal of that verdict, is what price he'll now pay. The maximum penalty for several of the charges is death. Talking to the jury on Tuesday, O'Toole predicted that the sentencing phase will last four weeks before cautioning that forecasting a specific timetable is less reliable than guessing the weather. The plan is for the court to be in session for four days a week, as long as the process takes. Until then, O'Toole told the jurors, ""Please put the case out of your minds. Enjoy the warm weather."" What's next for Tsarnaev? CNN's Ann O'Neill reported from Boston. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet, Alexandra Field, Aaron Cooper, Kevin Conlon, Jason Hanna and Steve Almasy contributed to this report.","Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found guilty of all 30 counts, may face death penalty .

"Vowing to cling on: Liberal Democrats leader Nick Clegg makes a speech during a General Election campaign visit to Sutton in south London yesterday . Nick Clegg yesterday vowed to cling on as Liberal Democrat leader even if the party is wiped out at the polls. Friends of the Deputy Prime Minister have previously indicated that he will quit as leader if the Lib Dems are reduced to fewer than 30 MPs, while sources have also suggested he will go if the party is left out of power after the election. But yesterday he insisted he would fight for his job ‘in all circumstances’. He told Sky News: ‘I’m really optimistic about the prospects of Liberal Democrats. 'Of course I want to continue to serve the country and serve my party, which I am so proud to have served for seven or eight years now.’ He added: ‘I want to lead the Liberal Democrats into and through the next Parliament in all circumstances. ‘All I am focused on at the moment is sounding the alarm about the very, very real risk that as the Labour Party and Conservative Party vacate the centre ground and hare off in which direction after another, there is a very real risk we undo all the sacrifices and hard work that have gone in over the last five years to put the country back on track economically.’ Meet and greet: Mr Clegg (far right) speaks to voters and their families during a General Election campaign visit to Sutton with Paul Burstow (second right) the party's candidate for Sutton and Cheam . His comments came as Business Secretary Vince Cable said he hoped to be made Chancellor if the Lib Dems form another coalition with the Conservatives. Mr Clegg also appeared to lean towards another deal with the Tories, saying he deserved ‘credit’ for forming the Coalition while he had endured ‘five years of constant bile from the Labour Party, who condemned us vitriolically for taking decisions which we only had to take because we had to clear up the mess they left behind’.","Sources claimed he'd go if Lib Dems are reduced to fewer than 30 MPs .

"Paul Gregory, 51, of Bedford, has been fined £795 for having a blue badge, claiming he could only walk 200 metres, when in fact he was a keen walker . A disability badge holder who claimed he could only walk 200 metres ended up in court after council officials noticed a newspaper report recounting his exploits on a 191-mile hike. When Paul Gregory, 51, applied to renew his blue badge, he claimed exercise left him breathless, despite being a keen walker and member of a mountaineering club. He was exposed when Bedford Borough Council staff read an article in The Westmorland Gazette,  describing how the 'experienced walker' had been attacked by cows in Cumbria on the third day of a hike in 2012. The article, which featured a picture of him dressed in walking gear, told how he was knocked over by four cows in a field at the edge of Shap in Cumbria. The council also found he had spent a weekend walking in Wales days before making a blue badge application. Gregory, of Bedford, pleaded guilty to two counts of dishonestly obtaining a blue badge by misrepresenting his physical abilities at Luton Magistrates' Court. He was fined £795, ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work and pay a £60 victim surcharge. He was also subject to a one year supervision order and told to undergo 19 sessions of 'thinking skills'. A Bedford Borough Council spokesman said it was one of the 'most outrageous cases' of blue badge fraud it had investigated. He said: 'He was taking part in national walking trips that many able-bodied adults would find difficult. 'Mr Gregory's abuse of the scheme is completely unacceptable and we will continue to investigate all reports of blue badge fraud thoroughly.'

"Apple offers a range of ways to unlock its devices from PINs to passwords and fingerprints. But you could soon use a selfie to gain access to your apps and messages thanks to Apple's latest patent. The filing details a system of scanning a user's face with the front-facing camera when the handset is moved into a certain position, and automatically unlocking the device if the image matches one on file. The patent (illustrated) was filed by the California-based firm in March 2011 and awarded earlier this week. It details a method of scanning a user's face using the front-facing camera each time the phone is moved into a certain position. If the scanned face matches a previously taken photo, the phone unlocks automatically . The patent was filed by the Californian tech giant in March 2011 and awarded earlier this week. Called 'Locking and unlocking a mobile device using facial recognition', the patent explains that current methods of unlocking a device are 'inconvenient and time consuming'. Apple's patent details a method for automatically unlocking a mobile device using a system comprising of 'capturing an initial image  while the device is locked, monitoring a motion state of the mobile device to determine whether the device is moving or is motionless;  analysing the images to detect a user's face and unlocking the device.' Android Lollipop users already have an almost identical feature known as Trusted face in the Smart Lock menu. It is an extension of Face Unlock that launched on Android Ice Cream Sandwich. Once the screen is enabled and the camera is held in front of the face, the screen automatically unlocks. This relies on the user pressing the power button to enable the screen. By comparison it appears that Apple's proposed system would track the movement of the phone to determine whether it is being used, or is placed flat on a table.

By comparison, it appears that Apple's proposed system would track the movement of the phone to determine whether it is being used, or is placed flat on a table. The screen wouldn't need to be enabled. Instead, once the phone is moved and positioned in front of the face the camera would begin scanning. It will only unlock if the angle of the face matches, or is similar to, the one that was initially taken to avoid the phone unlocking simply when the phone is near a face. As Apple explained: 'In one embodiment, the image is analysed for a facial profile of a human face, without regard to a specific user. Apple's proposed system tracks the movement of the phone to determine whether it is being used, or is placed flat on a table (flow chart shown). The screen wouldn't need to be enabled. Instead, once the phone is moved and positioned in front of the face the camera would begin scanning for a face . Android Lollipop users already have an almost identical feature known as 'Trusted face' (left) in the Smart Lock menu. Once the screen is enabled and the camera is held in front of the face, the screen automatically unlocks. The face icon between the Whatsapp and Chrome logo (right) shows the feature is enabled . 'In this case, the device will only need to determine that a human facial profile is present.' It continued that once an allotted period of time has elapsed and a user's face is not detected in any of the images, the device stays locked. 'In another embodiment, detecting the user's face may also include verifying that the user is an authorised user of the device,' the files continued. 'Trusted face' and Smart Lock are extensions of the Face Unlock feature that was launched on Android Ice Cream Sandwich (pictured). This relies on the user pressing the power button to enable the screen . 'The predetermined facial profile may be determined from an image that was previously captured by the device's camera and stored in a storage of images of authorised users.' Chip maker Qualcomm has unveiled its Sense ID 3D fingerprint scanner - the first biometric sensor using ultrasonic technology. It uses ultrasonic sound waves to capture the ridges, sweat pores and more on the tip of a finger in greater detail than capacitive touch ID sensors seen on the likes of Apple and Samsung devices. This not only makes it more accurate than other sensors, but it will also work even if the user’s hands are wet or have dirt or lotions on it, for example. Phones running Sense ID are expected to launch later this year, but Qualcomm did not reveal to MailOnline which devices or manufacturers it is working with. The patent also suggests this feature could be used by multiple users, in the way that multiple fingerprints can be added to its current Touch ID system. 'In this case, the database of images of authorised users would contain an image for each  user,' it added. 'To match a facial profile in the subsequent image, the device would have to compare the subsequent image to each image in the database. 'Furthermore, each authorised user may have an associated unlocking profile in the database that indicates what functions or applications of the device are enabled when the device is unlocked.' Phone makers are looking for alternative ways to secure devices while making them faster and more convenient to open. For example, Fujitsu recently demonstrated its iris scanning prototype that lets people access phones, apps and online accounts by staring at an infrared sensor. This would work in a similar way to facial recognition, but is more secure and unique to an individual user.

The advert called it a 'stylish two bedroom period house' which 'offers beautifully bright living space throughout with characterful touches and a pretty rear garden'. Foxtons declined to comment. At a price of £750,000, the buyer will have to pay £27,000 in stamp duty - the same as a second-hand narrow boat which is 50ft long. Henry Pryor, a buying agent, said: 'This home must be one of the few in which you genuinely could not swing a cat. 'Strangely the first floor master bedroom is wider than the ground floor room below and it has what boat owners would know as a ""galley kitchen"". 'A lot of buyers would struggle with the idea of living in a home little bigger than a cricket net.'

"The mother of a mentally ill daughter who killed herself last month has revealed how her condition worsened over years and eventually drove her to suicide. Doris Fuller's daughter, Natalie, 28, suffered from bipolar disorder and psychosis, and died when she stepped in front of a train in Baltimore, Maryland, last month. And in the wake of her death, Fuller has written about how her illness, which went undiagnosed until her early 20s, and said she was 'the bravest person I have ever known'. Scroll down for video . Opening up: Doris Fuller's daughter Natalie, left with her mom, killed herself last month - and now Fuller has opened up about how Natalie's bipolar disorder and psychosis led to her death . The mother and daughter pair had shot to fame in 2004 when they collaborated on a parenting guide based on Natalie being totally honest with her mother about whatever she was asked. Bestseller: Natalie opened up to her mom - and the result was this popular parenting book . In a long article about her daughter's life for the Washington Post, Fuller wrote how their famously close relationship was changed for good when Natalie had her first psychotic episode at the age of 22, after she had left for college. Fuller wrote: 'In the span of a few weeks she went from being a dazzling young adult with the world at her feet to a psych-ward patient with an arrest record.' Summarizing her last years, she said: 'My daughter lived more than six years with an incurable disease that filled her head with devils that literally hounded her to death, and she did it while laughing, painting, writing poetry, advocating and bringing joy to the people around her. 'She was the bravest person I have ever known, and her suicide doesn’t change that.' And though medicines and proper treatment gave Natalie her life back for a time, she eventually decided to stop taking her meds, which brought her troubles back, even more acute than before. In a mental health documentary video filmed in 2014, Natalie described the worst lows of her condition, in which she said terrifyingly real voices would tell her to hurt herself. She told the cameras: 'I believed that everything happening to me was real, and I thought that I was acting fine. 'But my mom and my brother and everyone around me could see something that I couldn't see. 'Even though [the voices] were telling me to hurt myself and do horrible things to myself, I still listened to them because I had a relationship with them. I thought they were real.' Although Natalie, a keen artist who sculpted, painted and wrote poetry, often seemed fine while on medication, Fuller told how her future seemed a little bleaker every time she relapsed. Difficulties: Natalie (left in 2014) was not diagnosed with a mental health problem until she was 22 - before then she had a regular childhood (right). She told how as she grew older voices started telling her to harm herself . Growing up: As a teenager, Natalie's no-holds-barred honesty helped make her mom a bestseller . She wrote: 'If she even inadvertently missed a few days of medication - even while receiving therapy and other forms of treatment - the demons would return, and one of the first things they would tell her was to stop taking her medicine. 'The second thing they would tell her was not to talk to her mom, the most powerful other influence in her life. 'Each time she obeyed and relapsed, she plunged into a longer free fall, hitting the ground harder, recovering more slowly and returning at a lower plateau.' According to the article, the final, ultimately fatal, change came last fall when Natalie concluded that the drugs were not helping her at all, and gave them up for good. Fuller was not specific about what happened in Natalie's last weeks, though in a post on a tribute site to her daughter, she mentioned that she had holidayed in Nicaragua with members of her family in February. Fuller, the executive director of the Treatment Advocacy Center charity has said since Natalie's death that she wants her 'legacy' to be increased understanding and compassion for the those who have mental illnesses.

"So, once again, it will all come down to the actions of a man from Salto. On this occasion, though, the focus will not be on Salto’s most famous son. Luis Suarez will be at the Parc des Princes tonight, forming one part of football’s most famous three-man attack, looking to fire Barcelona into the Champions League semi-finals. Usually when they reach this stage, Barcelona do not make any mistakes. Standing on the other side of the pitch will be someone who Suarez knows inside out, a player who hails from his home city in Uruguay and with whom he has shared a number of big nights when representing their country. Edinson Cavani prepares for Paris Saint-Germain's quarter-final clash with Barcelona . PSG train at Camp-des-Loges in Saint-Germain-en-Laye, west of Paris . Cavani celebrates scoring for the Paris side in the League Cup final last weekend . Edinson Cavani knows the spotlight will be shining on him this evening. If Paris Saint-Germain are to break through the glass ceiling and progress beyond the Champions League’s last eight, Cavani – a player known as El Matador – must torment the stars from Catalonia. The onus falls on Cavani for a number of reasons. First, PSG have been stripped by suspension of two key players, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Marco Veratti, the product of that ugly last 16 success against Chelsea; Thiago Motta is injured, while David Luiz is also a major doubt. Yet there is more to it than that. Cavani has a towering reputation in the game, stemming from three prolific seasons in Naples which led to his record-breaking move to Paris, but can you think of a really vital game that he has stamped his class all over? To suggest that may seem a little harsh. He came within the width of a goal post at Stamford Bridge of being the undisputed match winner and his bullet header in the first leg in February that gave Laurent Blanc’s side the opportunity to travel to London with parity. Since then, however, Cavani has endured problems and a significant goal drought for one of his talent. Between February 17 and April 5, Cavani went seven matches without scoring and only ended the fallow spell with a double as a substitute in the Coupe de Ligue final on Saturday. PSG won that game 4-0 but had matters sewn up before Cavani came on and helped himself to a double late on (Ibrahimovic had scored twice to give them breathing space); it was his first action since an angry altercation with Blanc a week earlier during a 3-2 win in Marseille. Zlatan Ibrahimovic slides in on Oscar during PSG's second round clash at Chelsea last month . Ibrahimovic is shown the red card for his challenge on Oscar to leave PSG up against it . Ibrahimovic trudges off the field and will miss the first leg of the quarter-final against Barcelona . It has led to speculation about his future in Paris and he has been linked with a number of sides in the Barclays Premier League; Liverpool, for one, would have loved to have signed him last summer but the figures were exorbitant (he earns more per week than Radamel Falcao). Arsenal and Manchester United have also been mentioned with him, while Manchester City tested the water in June 2013 when it was clear that Cavani’s time in Serie A was over; the intensity of his play, you suspect, would enhance his prospects of thriving in the English game. Nasser Al Khelaifi, PSG’s president, maintains one of the jewels in their crown will not be sold this summer but the recent noises Cavani has made have not been ultra-enthusiastic and hint that he might be ready for a new challenge after two years in France. ‘I came to play as a centre-forward with Zlatan and after, things changed for a variety of reasons,’ said Cavani. ‘Everything else is perfect in Paris. The club has behaved very well towards me. I have had some difficult moments personally, and they protected me, supported me. ‘The fans have also always supported me. I think I'm in one of the best places in the world. I'm staying focused on my preparation to give my best for my team, to the club that pays me and has shown faith in me. You never know in football. I'm not thinking about it.’ Tonight his focus will be on Barcelona. With six goals in eight Champions League appearances this season – he averages one every 143 minutes and has created 10 chances for his team-mates – it would be risible to suggest Cavani has something to prove on this stage. That said, it might not be wrong to suggest he needs a big moment. Ibrahimovic’s ability to sprinkle stardust is beyond question, while Veratti is fast becoming one of the finest midfielders in Europe but, without them, PSG need their man from Salto to sparkle. Their prospects depend on him. Louis van Gaal is considering a move for Cavani after seeing Radamel Falcao struggle this season .

"Time fries when you're having fun. Dedicated waitress Judy Eddingfield, 65, celebrated her 50th anniversary working at Winstead's restaurant in Kansas City last week and declares that it's the only job's she's ever had or ever wanted. 'It's like my home away from home and I just love it here,' Eddingfield told Fox. Scroll down for video . Dedicated employee: For most of her life Judy Eddingfield has been employed as a server at Winstead's in Kansas City and says it's the only job she's ever had or ever wanted . Is that you? A staff member at Winstead's said she believes one of the women in this photograph is Judy when she first started working at the restaurant . Classic establishment:  This is a photo of the The Winstead family who own the restaurant showing up for work in 1940 around the time when Judy Eddingfield's mother started working there . Eddingfield says she remembers when French fries and a classic Coca-Cola cost just 65 cents at the same restaurant she's worked at for half-a-century. For Eddingfield, slinging burgers with a smile is a family tradition. On April, 6, 1965 Eddinngfield began working at the restaurant where she was trained by her mother who had already been employed at the establishment for 13 years. Eddingfield said that her first day on the job when she was just 15-years-old she spilled a shake all over a woman's fur coat and thought for sure that she'd be fired. 'The tray tipped over and vanilla malt slid down a lady’s fur coat. I was so embarrassed,' Eddingfield told the Kansas City Star 'Of course, she hollered,' said Eddingfield. All was forgiven after Winstead's, open since 1940, got the coat cleaned. Eddingfield along with many of her siblings continued to provide top notch service. Loves to serve: Judy Eddingfield says that her kind customers are what make her job worthwhile . Lots of love: Winstead's honored Judy Eddingfield last week for her wonderful 50 years of working at the classic burger restaurant . 'I had two brothers, my sister, my mother, two aunts, two cousins and lots of friends that have worked here,' said Eddingfield. 'I was three years old when my mother started here, so I've been eating these burger 60 some years.' Eddingfield says she even met her first husband outside the restaurant and they married 18 months later. The Kansas City Star reports that one of Eddingfield's favorite Winstead’s memories was when Jerry Mathers and Tony Dow of the television series 'Leave It to Beaver' came to eat there in the late 1970's. She said that Mathers was 'talking with his hands' and knocked sent his food flying everywhere. Marriage: Judy Eddingfield even met her true love who she calls 'Frog' at Winstead's and the pair married 18-months-later . Celebration: Dedicated waitress Judy Eddingfield celebrated her 50th anniversary working at Winstead's restaurant in Kansas City last week and declares that it's the only job's she's ever had or ever wanted . 'Leave it to Beaver,' his on-screen brother said jokingly, almost as though it were scripted. On a scarier note, Eddingfield says she once was closing up the restaurant when a man started knocking on the door with a gun. She called 911 and hid in the bathroom until the police arrived. Eddingfield's employees say that as she gets older Eddingfield gets more delightful and that she is always willing to share her knowledge of the business. 'She trained me to be her. Pleasant as she is, prompt. So that people will come here for you and continue to come,' said server Sue Allen who has been there for 13 years. Close knit team: Eddingfield, pictured with some of her coworkers, has a passion for serving food . Nothing's changed!: Winstead's when it first opened in 1940 has an almost identical style to the Winstead's that's here today . Eddingfield's biggest tip she ever received was a generous man who treated his entire staff in 2014 and staff agree it was well deserved. Eddigfield turns 66 on May 13 and though she is getting older, she plans to keep on working as long as she is healthy. When asked why she chose to stay at the establishment for so long, she replied that the customers make her job worthwhile. 'The customers really make it special,' she says. General manager Kathi Fern says that Eddingfield is one of her best employees. 'It's just amazing the way she treats her customers,' said Fern. 'I call her my dinosaur. She's a dying breed and there will never be servers like her again.' said Fern of her dedicated employee. Classic drive-thru: Winstead's was established in 1940 and to this day is known for serving quality burgers at their drive-thru .","'It's like my home away from home and I just love it here,' Judy Eddingfield said of Winstead's in Kansas City .

"Microsoft has a new pilot program to hire people with autism for full-time positions within the company. The announcement was made on the company's blog by Microsoft Corporate VP of Worldwide Operations, Mary Ellen Smith, who has a teenage son, Shawn, with autism. The positions will be based at its Redmond campus in Washington and the program will be run in partnership with Specialisterne, a Danish nonprofit that helps train people with autism for careers in IT. Smith wrote on the blog: 'It's simple, Microsoft is stronger when we expand opportunity and we have a diverse workforce that represents our customers.' The announcement was made on the company's blog by Microsoft Corporate VP of Worldwide Operations, Mary Ellen Smith, who has a teenage son, Shawn, with autism . 'The day my son was diagnosed I distinctly remember the final words of two doctors I overheard as my husband and I left the medical center, ""I think they understand."" 'I also remember how we walked to the car, pulled onto the road, drove 15 miles to our home, and entered the house. All in silence. We did not know what to say. 'But we do now. What we learned over the last 15 years was to find our voice. To model what a unique advantage a young man like my son Shawn can offer. 'To think of where he is now, a college freshman and part-time employee, and where he has the potential to go, makes my husband and I so proud. The positions will be based at its Redmond campus in Washington and the program will be run in partnership with Specialisterne, a Danish nonprofit that helps train people with autism for careers in IT . She added: 'I am also proud of how our society and our workplace is moving forward with the commitment to help support people with autism and disabilities in general.' Last year Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was forced to apologize for saying that women don't need to ask for a raise and should just trust the system to pay them well. Nadella was blasted on Twitter and in blog posts for his comments, which were made at an event for women in computing. He had been asked to give his advice to women who are uncomfortable requesting a raise. His response: 'It's not really about asking for the raise, but knowing and having faith that the system will actually give you the right raises as you go along.' Microsoft is now focusing on diversity. Last year Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella (pictured) was forced to apologize for saying that women don't need to ask for a raise and should just trust the system to pay them well . Not asking for raise, he added, is 'good karma' that would help a boss realize that the employee could be trusted and should have more responsibility. Still, his comments at the event, the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing, underscored why many see technology companies as workplaces that are difficult to navigate or even unfriendly for women and minorities. Tech companies, particularly the engineering ranks, are overwhelmingly male, white and Asian. Criticized for their lack of diversity, major companies say they are trying to address the problem with programs such as employee training sessions and by participating in initiatives meant to introduce girls to coding. Twenty-nine percent of Microsoft's employees are women, according to figures the company released last year. Its technical and engineering staff and its management are just 17 percent female. That's roughly comparable to diversity data released by other big tech companies last year. Commenting on Microsoft's decision Sarah Lambert, Head of Policy at the National Autistic Society, told Daily Mail Online: 'It's encouraging to see a global company like Microsoft recognise the untapped potential of adults with autism and we hope that other organisations follow their lead. 'Autism is a spectrum condition and many people may have strengths such as accuracy, a good eye for detail and reliability, which can benefit all sorts of businesses, not just the technology industry.'","Microsoft Corporate VP of Worldwide Operations, Mary Ellen Smith, who has a teenage son Shawn with autism, made the announcement .

"Zara Phillips has revealed how she got her fitness back after the birth of her first child Mia - by hitting the exercise bike every morning before her daughter even woke up. The 33-year-old, who is vying for a place on Team GB at the Rio Olympics, welcomed Mia Grace with husband Mike Tindall last year. But after finding herself 'surprised' by how her fitness dropped during pregnancy, the Queen's granddaughter has committed to a strict exercise and diet regime to get back in shape. Scroll down for video . Zara Phillips has told of how she was surprised at how difficult it was to regain her fitness after the birth of her daughter, Mia, one (pictured left in January and right, last July when Mia was six months old) 'What surprised me about having a baby is losing all your fitness and how tough it is to get it back to that level again,' she said in an interview with The Sunday Time Magazine. Starting her morning at 7am, Zara has a breakfast of Greek yogurt and honey and tries to get in a stint on the exercise bike at her home, Gatcombe Park, before Mia wakes at 8am. Her day is then typically spent with the horses kept at her mother, Princess Anne's stables, before squeezing in another workout. 'Lunch is quick and simple, like soup and a sandwich or eggs and toast. I don't diet but I try to eat well and not to eat too many carbohydrates or sugary things. Zara (pictured competing in the 2012 London Games) said she is keen to win a place on Team GB in 2016 . The 33-year-old (pictured with Jessica Ennis-Hill with their medals in 2012) is yet to qualify for the forthcoming Olympics . 'In the afternoon I'll do extra exercise like swimming or cycling.'

The one-year-old's father previously revealed the couple had 'three Shetland ponies waiting for her'. Speaking in an interview in January, Mr Tindall, who has recently taken part in the reality skiing show The Jump, said: 'Eventing children have to be very relaxed. 'You are going to travel around a lot.' Earlier this year Zara told of how little Mia enjoyed playing with her royal relatives Prince George and her cousins, Savannah and Isla. Speaking to Daily Mail Australia at Magic Millions Race Day in January she said of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge: 'We've all got small ones now so it's great fun.'

"In recent years, Iceland has become an increasingly popular filming location with its majestic vistas being prominently featured in many hit TV series or Hollywood blockbusters. Despite the fact that Iceland has been used in filming as far back as 1920, well-known fantasy, sci-fi and action film directors and producers have all descended on the island nation as of late, prompting the quick development of 17 production services companies nationwide. Although the country's many stunning waterfalls and breathtaking glaciers translate beautifully to the silver screen, there are certain filming locations that consistently rank a cut above and are drawing fans of productions such as Game of Thrones, Interstellar or Prometheus. Thingvellir National Park provided the location for the North of Westeros in Game of Thrones . Fans will likely recognise the National Park as the setting of the battle of the Hound and Brienne . The black volcanic landscapes of Svartalfheim provided the filmmakers of Thor: The Dark World with the perfect otherworldly setting, as outlined in this Icelandair infographic. Meanwhile, Clint Eastwood opted to film battle scenes for both Letters from Iwo Jima and Flags of Our Fathers in Iceland – specifically along the dramatic cliffs of the Reykjanes Peninsula, just a quick drive from the capital. Scenes from Christopher Nolan’s epic Interstellar were filmed atop the blue ice glacier Svinafellsjokull in the Skaftafell National Park, which is also located near another favoured filming location: Iceland’s largest glacier, Vatnajokull. The Svinafellsjokull glacier provided a stunning setting for Christopher Nolan's epic film, Interstellar . Interstellar tells the tale of explorers who travel in search of a new planet to sustain the human race . Europe's most powerful waterfall, the Dettifoss, was used in the opening scenes of Prometheus . In Prometheus, the rushing waterfall in the background is meant to help depict the beginning of time . 'Interstellar was my second time filming in Iceland and it was another worldly experience,' the director told Film In Iceland. 'Iceland truly represents the beautiful extremes the nature has to offer.' Not to be left out, Ridley Scott scouted Europe’s most powerful waterfall, the Dettifoss, for the opening scenes depicting the beginning of time in Prometheus. And finally, Game of Thrones enthusiasts will undoubtedly recognise the north of Iceland, namely Thingvellir National Park, from Arya’s storyline and as the setting of the battle of the Hound and Brienne, in the North of Westeros. The Jokullsarlon lake, at the foot of the massive massive Vatnajokull glacier, is another favoured filming spot .","Iceland has become an increasingly popular filming location recently .

"The family of conjoined twin sisters who died 19 days after they were born have been left mortified after they arrived at their gravesite to find cemetery staff had cleared the baby section of all mementos and tossed them in the rubbish. Faith and Hope Howie were dubbed the miracle twins when they were born on May 8 last year with one body and two faces due to an extremely rare condition known as disrosopus. They died in hospital less than a month after they were born and their parents, Simon Howie and Renee Young, laid them to rest at Pinegrove Memorial Park in Sydney's west. Scroll down for video . Faith and Hope Howie were dubbed the miracle twins when they were born on May 8 last year with one body and two faces due to an extremely rare condition known as disrosopus . Family members have visited the grave every week to leave mementos and flowers for Faith and Hope, but when Mr Howie and Ms Young arrived on Thursday they found the site completely bare. 'We took Renee's aunts to see the girls for the first time and we found everything had been stripped away,' Mr Howie told Daily Mail Australia. 'We were devastated and mortified. We've had a little shrine set up and we've been adding to it since the funeral. 'It's heartbreaking to know we've set this up and it has been treated like rubbish.' Faith and Hope were buried in a pink coffin and their family and friends released doves and pink and white balloons at their funeral.

Faith and Hope's parents confronted staff from the cemetery and were told they were supposed to have been notified they are would be cleaned. They found their daughters' belongings in nearby rubbish bins, but were only able to retrieve about 25 percent of their memorabilia. 'There was no warning, it was just manhandled and thrown in the rubbish. It was through the entire baby section.' The couple retrieved what they could find and returned later in the afternoon to see what else they could salvage - by then everything had been laid out on shelves for people to collect. 'We've gone down there and maintained it. We make sure either side of the girls is clipped with scissors to (workers) don't need to go near it,' Mr Howie said. He said there was no reason for the items to be taken away.

I understand they have a job to do, but this is somebody else's loved one.' Pinegrove has offered an apology to the families affected. Faith and Hope were born with a rare condition called diprosopus, which means they share the same body and organs but have separate brains and two faces . The girls were transferred to Westmead Children's Hospital shortly after their birth on May 8 where they were closely monitored by doctors and nurses . They passed away just 19 days after they were born - their condition was so rare that only 35 cases have ever been recorded and none survived . 'The collection and storage of ornaments, especially photos, should have been handled much more respectfully and our goal is to improve it for the future,' Pinegrove's communication manager Karl Wolfenden said. 'We do understand the emotions of affected families. We have apologised to those we have spoken to and we have invited them to meet so we can find a solution that is agreeable to all. We are inviting other affected families to make contact also. 'Pinegrove is a fresh flower only and no ornamentation park but despite our rules and regulations we should have shown more respect to these items. 'We will discuss and seek an agreeable solution with families in the weeks ahead.'

"A bitter war of words has erupted between a young woman and a butcher in Sydney's eastern suburbs over exactly what happened when Belinda Bartholomew, the girlfriend of Roosters star Aidan Guerra, tried to buy a chicken to cook up for a Game Of Thrones-inspired feast. According to Ms Bartholomew, she was called names and told to go to 'an Aussie butcher' when she tried to change her chicken selection. However the butcher who was working at the shop on Monday has hit back saying Ms Bartholomew is 'lying' and trying to ruin the business. Scroll down for video . Belinda Bartholomew claims she was racially abused at a Bondi butcher on Monday night when she was buying a chicken for her and her Roosters star boyfriend Aidan Guerra to have for dinner . The war of words started, Ms Bartholomew claims, when the man working at Sam the Butcher in Bondi called her a 'f***ing c***' when she asked for a different chicken to the one he had picked up. There were apparently more problems when she went to use her card to pay for the choice bird. 'His eftpos machine wasn't connecting so it was taking a while to process, and I felt really uncomfortable as he was clearly agitated, huffing and throwing things around,' she said. Ms Bartholomew claims the man working at Sam The Butcher in Bondi swore at her and told her to leave, but the man working at the time said his customer was the one being rude . The chicken (pictured in front of Aidan Guerra) was cooked by Ms Bartholomew as part of a Game Of Thrones-inspired feast . 'Another woman entered the shop at this point and she ordered sausages and paid in cash, and when she asked for a receipt he clearly ignored her on purpose so she actually lent over the counter and printed her own.' However, the butcher vehemently denies he called Ms Bartholomew names and said she was the one being rude on a day when he had been having issues with his eftpos machine. 'She's just a troublemaker,' the butcher told Daily Mail Australia. 'I was very slow and she started having a go at me.' Ms Bartholomew (pictured with Mr Guerra) said the butcher told her to 'go to a f***ing Aussie butcher' But the man working vehemently denied any claims he swore at or abused the young woman (pictured) He told Daily Mail Australia that he's trying to fit into Australian life but sometimes finds it hard to cope with attitudes in Bondi. Ms Bartholomew claims the butcher then asked her 'Why don't you just go to a f***ing Aussie butcher'. 'She said I'm half Italian don't speak to me like that,' the butcher said. 'I said if you're going to be rude to me just take the chicken and go.' 'It's a free country there's about eight butcher shops in Bondi,' he added. Ms Bartholomew (left) and the butcher both said she didn't end up paying for the chicken she and Mr Guerra (right) later ate . Ms Bartholomew said she had decided to leave the shop without making a purchase but the butcher then thrust the chicken at her. 'I said not to worry about it and proceeded to leave while my purchase was still pending so he swiped the 1.5kg chicken at me and told me to ""take it and f*** off"",' she claims. 'I think I was just the victim of racial abuse,' the young Bondi woman wrote in a heated Facebook post shortly afterwards. However the butcher said he simply wanted her out of the shop and did not swear at or abuse her at any stage. 'She didn't even end up paying for the chicken, she got a free chicken,' he said. Ms Bartholomew told Daily Mail Australia 'I have never been to this particular butcher before.' 'I'm going to assume it wasn't me who he was really angry at, however I just happened to be in there at the time.'","Belinda Bartholomew claims she was racially abused at a Bondi butcher .

"All the smiles cannot hide the reality that McCluskey and his union are a potent, sinister force in British politics . Out on the election campaign trail under blue skies in South Wales, the trade union firebrand's manner was as warm as the weather. 'Didn't you once call me a slab-faced Marxist?' the famously militant leader of Unite asked me with a grin that was more genial than menacing. I had to confess I had. But that did not stop 'Red' Len McCluskey giving me the time of day on a street in Neath as he conducted a two-day tour of the Principality to drum up support for Labour's cause. Watching him in action, it was clear that he is highly popular with activists. His gospel of traditional hard-left socialism goes down well with the converted, as does his hackneyed anti-Conservative bile. 'We look to Wales as a beacon of hope to show what a Labour government can do. The Tories might have the money but we've got the working people on our side,' he said to cheers and applause. Yet all the smiles cannot hide the reality that McCluskey and his union are a potent, sinister force in British politics, seeking to use their financial and organisational muscle within the Labour movement to drag Britain back to the dark days of the 1970s. As the Mail reveals today, the sheer scale of the influence Unite holds on scores of Labour candidates is chilling given the socialist revolution the union would seek to impose. Indeed, McCluskey, a former Liverpool dock worker who keeps a drawing of Lenin in his office and once boasted of presiding over more strikes than any other union boss, is quite open about his yearning for that period when the unions held the government to ransom: 'We are supposed to believe that the Seventies was a horrible time. It wasn't. It was a time of great advances for working people,' he has said. Labour's umbilical link to McCluskey's union has received much less attention in recent days than a potential deal with the left-wing, anti-austerity SNP, yet it is just as potentially disastrous for the governance of this country. Not only is Unite – which has a claimed membership of 1.42million – intertwined with the Labour Party's structure, MPs and finances, but it also remains addicted to the failed socialist policies of the past, including a major expansion in the public sector, less flexibility in the workplace, higher taxation and ever more state spending. Just like Nicola Sturgeon, McCluskey wants to make Labour bolder, 'more radical, courageous and brave'. Only last month, he appeared to threaten illegal action if a Tory Government pushed through further restrictions on strikes in the public sector. 'When the law is misguided, when it oppresses people and removes their freedoms, can we respect it? I am not really posing the question, I'm giving the answer. It ain't going to happen,' he declared. Despite all his talk about the oppression of working people, however, he has not done badly for himself. Last year it was revealed he received a £5,000 rise, taking his pay and pensions package to £140,281. McCluskey has denied that he has too much influence over Ed Miliband, adding that Unite is supporting the party '100 per cent' McCluskey's determination to influence Labour was all too evident in Wales. With an air of quasi-regal grandeur, he visited several factories, gave talks to Labour activists and held a number of photo opportunities – including one in Cardiff at the statute of that old champagne socialist Nye Bevan. When I spoke to McCluskey, he downplayed his hardline socialism, instead talking about the need for investment in industry and the economy. And he denied that he had too much influence over Ed Miliband's party: 'If only that were true,' he said, while proclaiming his loyalty to the cause. 'Unite is supporting Labour 100 per cent,' he said, adding that is now campaigning 'all over the country'. Yet there was something synthetic about McCluskey's protestations of support for Labour. As I watched him at close quarters, it became more apparent that he was going through the motions. When asked in an interview with BBC Radio Wales about Miliband's leadership, McCluskey could say only: 'He's doing OK'. Beneath the surface, I have no doubt he longs to hear Ed offering more nakedly socialist policies, rather than trying to appeal to Middle England. Moreover, if Labour and Unite really think that McCluskey is an asset in the election, they are doing their best to keep quiet about it. When I tried to find out McCluskey's schedule for his Welsh visit from any number of Unite and Labour sources, including McCluskey's own press officer, I was greeted with either hostility or silence. No one would give me any information. It was only through persistence and good luck that I managed to track him down, to the outrage of his press officer who asked me paranoiacally: 'How did you find us? Did you fit a tracking device to Len's car?' That kind of anxiety and suspicion shows more than just a lack of confidence. It reveals a fear that, just as with Sturgeon's spendthrift radicalism, the hard-Left dogma of Unite is likely to alienate floating middle-of-the-road voters. Such fears are, of course, only too justified. For this is no small-town demagogue. On the contrary, McCluskey is pivotal to Labour's future because of the stranglehold his union has over the party. It was Unite and the other affiliated unions that ensured Ed Miliband was elected leader in 2010 against his more moderate brother David, who enjoyed greater popularity among Labour MPs and the rank and file. Since 2010, Unite is estimated to have donated at least £14.4million to Labour's coffers. It was Unite and the other affiliated unions that ensured Ed Miliband (pictured left) was elected leader in 2010 against his more moderate brother David (right) The dominance of Unite runs right through Labour's organisation, with huge implications for the make-up of a putative Miliband government. One recent analysis showed that 159 Labour MPs from the last parliament receive sponsorship from Unite or are members of the union, including senior frontbenchers such as Harriet Harman, Angela Eagle, Hilary Benn and Sadiq Khan. In addition, 133 Labour candidates at this election are reported to have links to Unite. As Martin Mayer, chairman of Unite's political committee and a member of Labour's National Executive recently admitted, the union is involved in a 'serious attempt to win back the party'. Tragically for Britain, there is now a real danger that an incoming Labour government would be forced to lurch even further to the Left, not just by SNP by also by Unite, with Miliband too weak to stand up to those who are determined he will be their puppet in Downing Street.","The scale of influence Unite holds is chilling given what it seeks to impose .

"The battle of the batteries is hotting up. Reports claim Google is the latest firm to set up a team dedicated to boosting how long our phones, tablets and even electric cars can run for. And sources said the four-man team spends its days devising and testing different technologies from the flexible to the wearable. Reports claim Google is the latest firm to set up a team dedicated to boosting how long our phones, tablets and even electric cars (pictured) can run for. Sources told the Wall Street Journal that the four-man team spends its days devising and testing different technologies from the flexible to the wearable . The reports were made by Alistair Barr in the Wall Street Journal. Google has been working on similar projects since 2012 when former Apple battery expert Dr Ramesh Bhardwaj began leading a testing team. Mr Barr explained that Dr. Bhardwaj recently described how 'solid-state, thin-film batteries could be used in smartphones and other mobile devices that are thinner, bendable, wearable and even implantable in the human body.' He also referenced a video for Project Loon that revealed how Google has been working with experts at AllCell Technologies to develop batteries that function at subfreezing temperatures. This is vital for Google's Project Loon balloons designed to float near the stratosphere and provide internet to wider areas.

In a video for Project Loon (pictured), Google revealed it has been working with experts at AllCell Technologies to develop batteries that function at subfreezing temperatures . Fan site AppleInsider recently spotted nine job listings on Apple's official recruitment site in the past month that relate to batteries. These include one for an iOS battery life software engineer (pictured left) and another for iOS software power systems engineer (pictured right) The AllCell technology uses wax and a graphite material, for example, to help lithium-ion batteries absorb heat and spread it across the power pack. Last week, a team of Stanford University chemists unveiled an aluminium battery that can recharge in less than 60 seconds. Apple defines the Apple Watch battery on its Watch product page. It says its all-day battery life is based on 18 hours of use. All-day battery life: This includes 90 time checks, 90 notifications, 45 minutes of app use, and a 30-minute workout with music. Audio playback: The battery will last up to 6.5 hours when playing music. Talk time: Apple said the Watch can be used for up to three hours for calls. Workout: During this test the Watch lasted for seven hours when a workout session was active and the heart rate sensor was on. Watch: When used as a watch the device will last for 48 hours if checked five times an hour. Power reserve: When the Apple Watch's battery  gets low it switches into Power Reserve mode letting users tell the time for up to 72 hours - with four time checks an hour. Charging time: The company said it takes 1.5 hours to charge the Watch to 80% and 2.5 hours for a full charge. Apple's tests were carried out in March 2015 with a pre-production Apple Watch and software paired with an iPhone using pre-production software. Apple said battery life varies with environmental factors, use, configuration, and 'many other factors' so actual results will vary . It is said to be the first high-performance aluminium battery which is 'fast-charging, long-lasting and inexpensive' and is more environmentally friendly than alkaline batteries. It also can't catch fire like lithium-ion technology. At present the rechargeable aluminium battery generates about two volts of electricity, the highest achieved yet with aluminium,'  but the researchers said the battery has only half the voltage of existing technology. And Google isn't the only tech giant working on such plans. Last month, Apple began recruiting for experts to help boost the battery across its range of mobiles and laptops. At least nine job listings were discovered by fan site AppleInsider and include listings for an iOS battery life software engineer, a software power systems engineer, battery pack engineering manager and a cell engineer. In particular, the iOS software power systems engineer role said the successful candidate 'will be working on design and development of software for triage of battery life issues, modeling of power consumed by different parts of the system, and analytics to understand large scale battery life trends.' Atmel also recently announced its latest microcontrollers (MCUs) that can be fitted to a variety of gadgets and are so low power they can harvest energy from a person's body. The  SAM L microcontrollers are part of Atmel's 32-bit ARM-based MCU range and are powered by chip maker ARM's Cortex M0+ 32-bit processors. A number of Apple devices, including the iPhone 5S and iPad Air are powered by chips based around ARM technology. A team of Stanford University chemists recently unveiled an aluminium battery that can fully recharge in less than 60 seconds. It is said to be the first high-performance aluminium battery which is 'fast-charging, long-lasting and inexpensive' and is more environmentally friendly than alkaline batteries . Last month, Atmel released its latest microcontrollers (MCUs) for a variety of gadgets that are so low power they can even harvest energy from a person's body. Atmel said its MCUs extend 'battery life from years to decades, reducing the number of times batteries need to be changed in devices' Atmel said its MCUs extend 'battery life from years to decades, reducing the number of times batteries need to be changed in devices such as fire alarms, healthcare, medical, wearable, and devices placed in rural, agriculture, offshore and other remote areas.' They use a third of the power of rival chips and tests have shown they are the lowest power microprocessor ever made. The microcontrollers run on the firm's picoPower technology and Atmel's Event System that makes different parts of the device work together to carry out tasks. By effectively 'sharing' energy, the whole device uses less power and, subsequently, less battery. It can also manage how much energy is being used by other components to make them as efficient as possible. Plus, the technology is so low power it can harvest energy from the body using changes in temperature. During a demonstration of the microcontrollers at this year's CES, Andreas Eieland, Atmel's director of product marketing demonstrated how he could power a radio by placing his hand on a panel. This panel recognised a change in temperature between the hand and the room and this was harvested to create charge .","Reports claim Google is latest firm to test alternative battery options .

"A gun trafficker for convicted killer Aaron Hernandez said he was 'awed' by the former New England Patriots star when he sent him an assault rifle and a pair of handguns a month before Odin Lloyd’s killing. Oscar 'Papoo' Hernandez Jr - no relation to the disgraced NFL player - has pleaded guilty to weapons charges in connection to his infamous namesake’s murder case. Earlier this month, Aaron Hernandez, 25, was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for first-degree murder of the semi-professional football player in 2013. Scroll down for video . Bad bro-mance: Oscar Hernandez Jr (left), 24, said he was 'awed' by New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez (right) and 'grateful to be noticed' when the football player paid him $15,000 for three guns . Unfortunate timing: Oscar Hernandez  shipped his namesake a rifle and two handguns in April 2013 - a month before the NFL player shot dead Odin Lloyd (pictured on screen in court) Hernandez had been a rising star in the NFL with a $41million contract when he was arrested in June of that year. In a sentencing memo in Oscar Hernandez’s weapons case released this week to Boston Herald the 24-year-old Florida man stated that he was blinded by the football player's fame ,'grateful to be noticed [by him], and had no way of anticipating the terrible events which would follow.' Although Oscar Hernandez was never called to testify against Aaron Hernandez during his trial earlier this month, his lawyer wrote in the memorandum to Judge William Young that his client was beaten by fellow inmates at the Wyatt Detention Center 'after having been incorrectly listed as a government witness.' Following the attack, Oscar Hernandez spent some time in solitary confinement at the Rhode Island jail. Mr Hernandez, a father from Belle Glen, Florida, is now facing up to 30 months in prison after pleading guilty in January to charges of transporting firearms across state lines; obstruction of justice; lying to a federal grand jury and witness tampering. Justice for Odin: The 25-year-old athlete (left) was found guilty April 15 of first-degree murder in the 2013 shooting death of the semi-professional football player (right) The confessed gun smuggler was scheduled to be sentenced Monday, but Judge Young has delayed the punishment phase until May 5. Public defender Charles McGinty, who represents Hernandez, is seeking a sentence of one year and one day for his client. Investigators said the Florida resident shipped three guns including FEG 7.62x39 Hungarian rifle, to Aaron Hernandez in the spring of 2013. The weapons had been stashed inside a beat-up Toyota Camry that was found in the football player's garage in North Attleboro, Massachusetts. A friend of Oscar Hernandez testified during the NFL star’s trial that the gun trafficker purchased the weapons April 16, 2013, five days after Aaron transferred $15,000 into his account. Oscar Hernandez was arrested April 17, 2014, and indicted by a grand jury in Massachusetts on gun trafficking charges. Back behind bars: Following the sentencing phase, Hernandez was handcuffed and returned to jail. He has since been transferred to a maximum-security facility . The indictment stated that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives had traced three guns that had been recovered during the investigation of Odin Lloyd's killing. The ATF determined that all three guns were purchased in Florida in April 2013. Massachusetts officials said they have been unable to find the gun used to kill Lloyd, which they've identified as a .45-caliber Glock. None of the three guns mentioned in Oscar Hernandez's indictment is a .45-caliber Glock. Meanwhile, his notorious namesake was transferred last week to the maximum security state Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center in Shirley to begin serving his life sentence. Aaron Hernandez is also awaiting a trial date for the 2012 homicides of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado.","Oscar Hernandez Jr has pleaded guilty to transporting firearms, obstruction of justice, lying to a federal grand jury and witness tampering .

"Visitors to a metro-Detroit museum have a chance to get an up-close look at the chair Abraham Lincoln was shot in at Washington D.C.'s Ford's Theatre in 1865 next week as the museum puts it center stage. The red, worn chair will be removed from its enclosure at Dearborn's Henry Ford Museum and displayed in an open plaza on April 15 as part of the museum's observance of the assassination's 150 anniversary. Two days earlier, it will be onstage when renowned historian and Lincoln expert Doris Kearns Goodwin delivers a sold-out lecture at The Henry Ford. The chair in which Abraham Lincoln was shot has been on display at The Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan, for 85 years. On April 15, it will be removed from its encasing to be displayed for the 150th anniversary of the assassination . Abraham Lincoln (left) was shot in Ford's Theatre in Washington D.C. on April 14, 1865 by pro-Confederacy actor, John Wilkes Booth (right). Lincoln died from his injuries the next day . The chair has a dark stain on the back, which many visitors believe to be blood from the shooting. But historians at the museum say that the stain is oil from other people's heads who sat in the chair before Lincoln . Lincoln's chair has been part of the museum started by pioneering automaker Henry Ford - no relation to the theater-owning Ford family - since its founding 85 years ago. The government removed it from the theater and held it as evidence, and it ended up at the Smithsonian Institution. The wife of a theater co-owner petitioned to reclaim it, then sold it at auction to an agent working for Henry Ford. Henry Ford also bought the Logan County Courthouse where Lincoln practiced law in Illinois in the 1840s and moved it to the outdoor area next to his museum known as Greenfield Village. For decades, the theater chair was housed in that courthouse. Around 1980, the chair was placed inside the museum, where it's now part of the 'With Liberty and Justice for All' exhibit. 'Lincoln was one of Henry Ford's heroes - when he decided he wanted to have this village, he wanted to collect Lincoln stuff as an educational tool,' said curator Donna Braden. 'The courthouse is pretty much the first thing Henry Ford acquired related to Lincoln and the chair came soon after.' A playbill from Our American Cousin from the night President Abraham Lincoln was assassinated on April 14, 1865 is shown on display at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn . A copy of a hand colored 1870 lithographic print by Gibson & Co. provided by the U.S. Library of Congress shows John Wilkes Booth shooting U.S. President Abraham Lincoln as he sits in the presidential box at Ford's Theatre . A copy of a 1865 lithographic print by Currier & Ives provided by the U.S. Library of Congress shows the same event from a different angle . Many visitors wonder whether dark spots on the back of the chair are Lincoln's blood. Not so, say museum workers: The stains are oil from other people's heads who sat in the chair before that fateful night when Lincoln was shot by a pro-Confederacy actor, John Wilkes Booth. Steve Harris, a historic presenter at the museum, tells passers-by that Lincoln's head would have been positioned much higher than the stain because he was 6ft, 4in tall. Taking in objects from the final hours of two important American lives is a major draw to the museum. The Henry Ford also owns the limousine President John F. Kennedy was riding in when he was fatally shot in Dallas nearly a century later. Museum officials say the chair and car are among the most visited artifacts in the museum, along with the bus Rosa Parks rode in when she refused to give up her seat to a white rider and helped spark the civil rights movement. Ford's Theatre in Washington D.C. has arranged the presidential box identically to the way it was the night Lincoln was shot through the doorway . Abraham Lincoln's iconic silk top hat, which he was wearing the night he was assassinated, is part of the museum display at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C. Goodwin, author of 'Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln,' told The Associated Press that the chair will offer an extra 'dimension' to her words and the experience of those in the room. 'There's an intimacy to it that catapults you back in time,' she said. 'And hopefully, along with that, you're not just thinking of the death but the life that made it worthwhile.' Museum visitor Jeff Buczkiewicz stood before the chair, peered silently into the glass-enclosed case at the rocking chair, then snapped pictures for posterity . 'You just get drawn into these things,' said Buczkiewicz, 47, who came from suburban Chicago with his family to the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan. 'It is a tragic part of our history and our country. I think it's important to take it all in.' Milestone anniversaries seem to add to the impact of objects like the chair and limo. About 8,000 people visited the limo on November 22, 2013, a free-admission day marking the 50th anniversary of JFK's assassination, so the chair is likely to draw plenty of visitors on the Lincoln anniversary, which also has free admission. The single-shot Deringer pistol John Wilkes Booth used to kill Abraham Lincoln is displayed at the Center for Education and Leadership at Ford's Theatre in Washington . 'It really is about the power of the artifact,' said Patricia Mooradian, president of The Henry Ford, as the entire history attraction is known.

Buskiewicz has also visited Dealey Plaza in Dallas where Kennedy was assassinated. 'You just have to try to take it in when you're in those areas,' he said, but he wonders 'why we gravitate' toward places and things associated with these types of events.

"Tottenham are considering a state-of-the-art stadium with a retractable pitch that enables them to become the home of a new NFL London franchise. The bold design of the new £400million stadium, due to be completed for the start of the 2018-19 season, could involve a ‘slide-out’ grass football pitch with an NFL-style synthetic surface housed underneath. The option of extra-large changing rooms, to accommodate NFL squad sizes that can amount to as many as 70 players at a game, is also being explored by architects. Tottenham are considering sharing their new £400m stadium with an NFL franchise . A spokesman for the north London club did not rule out the possibility this week, confirming that they are ‘looking at options’ in order to ‘future-proof the design’. The NFL is said to be within five years of having a permanent franchise in London. Indeed officials will be testing logistics when they stage their three games at Wembley this autumn, with teams looking at how quickly they can have their players back in the USA and ready to play again. The clash between the Buffalo Bills and Jacksonville Jaguars on October 25 will kick-off at 1.30pm while the New York Jets vs Miami Dolphins game on October 4 and Detroit Lions vs Kansas City Chiefs contest on November 1 will both begin at 2.30pm. As well as allowing the NFL to experiment with a live game on TV at breakfast time in the States (9.30am Eastern time), teams are able to take advantage of the time difference and be home on American soil by Sunday night. Tottenham's new state-of-the-art stadium is due to be ready in time for the 2018-19 season . Spurs' new 65,000 capacity stadium could be better suited to the NFL than the 90,000-seat Wembley . If Tottenham press ahead with the proposed stadium design and secure the NFL franchise it would represent a significant blow to the FA, who also see the NFL as a potentially lucrative partner for Wembley, their £757m stadium. But the NFL are keeping their options open at this stage in the knowledge that a new London stadium designed with American football requirements in mind would be hugely advantageous. Even the proposed capacity of 65,000 for the new White Hart Lane is a more realistic target than 90,000 seats which Wembley boasts. Wembley does have the iconic status that the NFL finds attractive but there are other issues with the national stadium. Not least the fact that they have to leave the lowest 5,000 seats empty so that the view of spectators is not restricted by the mass of huge bodies on the touchline. The modern NFL stadiums make sight-lines for spectators a priority and the new White Hart Lane could overcome the problem that is experienced at Wembley by having the artificial pitch at a significantly lower level beneath the moveable grass pitch. Wembley has hosted NFL regular-season matches since the International Series began in 2007 . Detroit Lions' clash with Atlanta Falcons kicked off early, as will all three games at Wembley later this year . Retractable grass pitches are nothing new in modern stadia design. England have played on two: at Gelsenkirchen in Germany during the 2006 World Cup and in the Sapporo Dome in Japan four years earlier. The Gelredome in Holland also has a retractable pitch, as does the University of Phoenix Stadium that hosted this year’s Super Bowl. The advantage for these stadiums is the ability to grow the grass in a more natural environment, outside, away from the shadows of the stands while also having the capacity to stage different events without damaging the playing surface. A feat of modern engineering, a pitch can be moved outside the stadium in less than four hours. A spokesman for Tottenham said: ‘The club has always seen the new stadium as being at the heart of the regeneration of the area and it is important, therefore, to look at how we future-proof the design, as well as increasing the functionality of the stadium, whilst being conscious of community uses. At this stage it is about looking at options but nothing more.’","Tottenham's new £400m stadium due to be completed for 2018-19 season .

"A pensioner is living in fear after his Jack Russell saved him from a badger the size of a large pig with six-inch teeth. Shocked Terry Cooper, 79, was enjoying the sunshine in his garden with his dog Sam when the huge animal burst through a hedge with two cubs.

'He was the size of a pig, with teeth about six inches long. They were as long as a lemonade bottle is wide.' 'My dog turned me round and quickly pulled me in,' Mr Cooper added. 'The badger didn't attack me, so I didn't seek medical attention, but I was left badly shaken.

Alex Stevens, South West regional policy advisor, said: 'Badgers are protected by law and people shouldn't be interfering with badgers or setts. 'This incident is really unusual and surprising, given the time at which it happened. But badgers are pretty headstrong. I suspect he was searching for an easy source of food. 'Badgers can squeeze through any gaps in fences or hedges which are bigger than 7.5 centimetres. So if you have fencing with the slats spaced more narrowly, that will help. 'Even better, people can protect their property through badger-proof fencing. This goes a foot or two into the ground so that badgers cannot tunnel underneath it. 'People should also keep the lids on their bins, and if they have a dog or a cat, don't leave their food or water bowls out in the open.

"(CNN)It is a city transformed, swollen in size but shrunken in scope, anxiously awaiting what comes next. On Kabul's streets, you can easily find the uneasy legacy of America's longest war. Outside one mosque -- mixing with other men desperate for a day's worth of casual manual labor -- are five men who months ago had one valuable skill NATO depended upon: they speak English. Now however, their world has turned upon them. They were, each for a different reason -- each for a reason they do not understand -- all fired from their jobs and then blacklisted, they say, meaning they can no longer get work with other government groups or NGOs here. The skill they once thrived off has left them isolated, and fearing reprisals. They sleep in market stalls, and avoid traveling to see their families in case the threats they face are visited upon them. ""My family is still living in the provinces,"" one of the men tells me. ""I cannot go there. I am living in a market, in one of the empty shops."" Another adds: ""My family, everybody, give up on me, they are nervous."" A third man -- all requested anonymity -- says: ""Right now I sleep here, on the street, in this mosque area."" ""We are in prison in Afghanistan,"" a fourth says. The U.S. Embassy and NATO declined to comment for this story. EXCLUSIVE: The last Americans in Afghanistan . Helicopters still buzz around the capital. Its population is five times what it was when NATO arrived here, even by the most conservative estimates, and the violence in the provinces means people swell it further still -- arriving in Kabul's dusty, mountainous bowl of a city in order to avoid the fighting. Neighborhoods that were once massively over-priced cliques of foreigners living in ""poppy palaces"" -- villas allegedly bought from profiteers of the opium trade -- are now empty. One road, forever pot-holed in the past decade, is now being covered over by Afghans who, it seems, are finally reclaiming that street. Even Chicken Street, the hackneyed pedestrian shopping road where new Western arrivals would buy carpets or local trinkets, is more or less deserted. One shopkeeper says it could be the embassy security warnings that are keeping people away now. It is the same for the restaurants here that used to brim with contractors and NGO workers. They are now empty, the sound of their heavy metal doors echoing across deserted tables. It is immeasurably different to three years ago when I lived there. Drive out east -- past the women in burqas who sit on road bumps, holding their children, hoping drivers will slow enough to throw them change -- and you see roads lined with the detritus of America's war here. Huge lines of excavators, cherry-pickers, and forklift trucks sit idle. At times it seemed there was little America wouldn't do, or try, to meets its often fluid goals in the country. Yet today, the machines that could have once moved small mountains do little more than gather dust. EXCLUSIVE: Afghan woman forced to marry her rapist . Further down the road too are more winners-turned-losers of the NATO presence here. Vast supply chains once kept 120,000 troops fed and watered. Trucks lined the roads and climbed up to the military bases. Now the bases are gone, and the trucks that once supplied millions sit still. Their bosses may have fled abroad with their winnings, yet the drivers have been left behind, stuck with vehicles that cost them $30,000 to buy -- and $1,000 a year just to keep on the road -- but that would fetch just a tenth of that price now. ""The contracts were with big businessmen and commanders who were giving us very little and made themselves very rich and are now living comfortably in Dubai,"" one truck driver tells us. Yet still the wedding palaces proliferate. Along one stretch of road their endless, multiplying lights throb. Each night the houses seem packed -- the commitment to the future still is popular here, despite the uncertainty -- even if the lights that decorate them seem more and more like a symbol of leaving. One set actually replicates the shape of an expensive hotel in Dubai. The city's lights do shine staggeringly and often constantly -- something the Taliban never achieved during their rule here. NATO's efforts to keep them on are reported to have involved diesel power stations that cost billions but were barely switched on. The question many surely ask here -- as the last American troops prepare to retreat inside the U.S. Embassy by the end of next year -- is how much longer the lights will continue to glow.

"A chef has created a 10in-tall, half-kilogram burger piled with six forms of three different meats and containing a whopping 2,000 calories. The Whole Damn Farm, which costs £13.50, is the creation of Sam Longhurst, head chef of Splendid Kitchen, Manchester. He devised the mega meal - which contains two beef patties and a whole fried chicken thigh - after he was challenged by diners to create a burger containing three kinds of meat. The Whole Damn Farm burger features two beef burgers, homemade bacon jam, ham chunks, a whole chicken thigh, barbequed pulled pork and bacon rashers . Ready, get set, go! Customer Angela Fox gets ready to take on the mighty meat challenge . The monstrous meat feast has two beef burgers weighing 220g, a layer of homemade bacon jam, 100g of ham chunks and a 150g whole battered and fried chicken thigh. Added to that is 80g of barbequed pulled pork and four rashers of bacon all sandwiched between two brioche buns. With a meat equivalent of six Big Macs the burger was created after a customer presented with the restaurant's 'Cow & Chicken' burger - a feast in its own right - remarked, 'It's almost the whole damn farm.' Mr Longhurst said: 'We are always up for a challenge and when a customer seemed disappointed by a burger that only contained beef and chicken, we knew we had to take it one step further. 'You could say we've taken it several steps further as there are six different forms of meat on there. I think it'll keep the punters satisfied.' The head chef joined forces with owner Mike Edge to set out to achieve what might constitute a whole farmyard of animals in one meal. Chef Sam Longhurst from the Splendid Kitchen restaurant in Manchester with his mega burger . Encased between a semi-brioche bun are: . Two beef burgers weighing 220g . Layer of homemade bacon jam . 100g of ham chunks . A whole chicken thigh weighing 150g . 80g of barbequed pulled pork . Four rashers of bacon . Mr Longhurst, who lives in Salford with his wife and eight-year-old son Matthew, said: 'It's amusing when people are cocky and decide to go for it, as it's a monster of a burger and they don't realise that. I have only just managed to eat it myself. 'It's loads of fun making stuff that's a little bit ridiculous. I experiment with cooking at home too. 'Matthew and I will make homemade burgers stuffed with cheese and cold meats, so I think of The Whole Damn Farm burger as a supersized version of that. 'I think Matthew would be scared of it, to be honest, a burger the same size as his head.' Mr Edge said: 'We wanted something show-stopping; we haven't gone down the road of using crisps and sweets as toppings, where it starts to get silly.

"(CNN)Hillary Clinton's campaign-in-waiting met on Saturday in its Brooklyn headquarters, a day before the former secretary of state officially announces her campaign for president, according to a Democrat who attended the meeting. Robby Mook, Clinton's soon-to-be campaign manager, distributed a ""values statement"" at the meeting that outlined what the campaign will stand for, what their goals are and how they plan to win -- something Clinton failed to do in 2008. The campaign's purpose, the document states, is ""to give every family, every small business, and every American a path to lasting prosperity by electing Hillary Clinton the next President of the United States."" The document makes clear that the campaign will try to avoid mistakes that plagued Clinton's failed 2008 run. Many of the ""guiding principles"" in the memo mention issues that sunk Clinton's first campaign. The document, according to the source, includes the ideas from Mook, along with a wide array of Clinton's soon-to-be staffers and advisers. The memo maintains that the campaign must remain humble, disciplined and united, something voters in Iowa and others states have said Clinton did not do in 2008. ""This campaign is not about Hillary Clinton and not about us,"" reads the document that was obtained by CNN. In the section about the campaign's guiding principles, the document reads, ""We are humble: We take nothing for granted, we are never afraid to lose, we always outcompete and fight for every vote we can win. We know this campaign will be won on the ground, in states."" It also calls on campaign staffers to remain ""disciplined"" and ""open to a diverse range of views."" ""When we disagree, it's never personal. Once a decision is made, we execute it -- together,"" reads the memo. ""We know there will be tough days, but we will bounce back and get back to work."" The document also appears to telegraph the name to Clinton's campaign: ""Hillary for America."" Clinton is planning to launch her presidential candidacy on Sunday through a video message on social media, according to Democratic sources. Shortly after her announcement, Clinton will travel Iowa and New Hampshire, critical early caucus primary and caucus states.","Robby Mook, Hillary Clinton's soon-to-be campaign manager, distributes a ""values statement""

"(CNN)Civil unions between people of the same sex will soon be recognized in Chile. The country joined several of its South American neighbors in allowing the unions when President Michelle Bachelet enacted a new law on Monday. ""This is a concrete step in the drive to end the difference between homosexual and heterosexual couples,"" Bachelet said. The new law will take effect in six months. It will give legal weight to cohabiting relationships between two people of the same sex and between a man and a woman. The Chilean government estimates that around 2 million people will be able to benefit from the change. The law is intended to end discrimination faced by common-law couples, such as not being allowed to visit partners in hospital, make medical decisions on their behalf or decide what to do with their remains. It also gives the couples greater rights in the realms of property, health care, pensions and inheritance. A number of South American nations have moved to allow same-sex civil unions in recent years. But marriage between people of the same sex is legal only in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay.","President Michelle Bachelet signs law that will take effect in six months .

The visitors were unfortunate not to double their lead through Tariqe Fosu only minutes later when his his curled effort skewed just wide. The Gunners pressed for an equaliser before the break with Gnabry slicing wide from 10yards out before Wilshere saw a decent strike saved by Reading keeper Daniel Lincoln. Wilshere became more and more influential when the game resumed after the interval - finding Alex Iwobi following a typical surge from midfield only for the forward's shot to be well saved.

"A device has been created that can scan entire planes for contraband, bombs and weapons. The mobile X-ray scanner, heralded as the world’s first ‘airplane scanner’, sweeps down a plane and can detect various objects inside. While the radiation emitted by the scanner is not safe yet for humans to be in the plane when it is operated, the company behind it thinks it could become a vital tool in aircraft safety. Scroll down for video . Romanian company MB Telecom has revealed the Roboscan 2M Aeria. It uses a cone of radiation to sweep across planes (shown) and look inside. The device is accurate enough to find a filament in a light bulb. But the radiation it emits is not safe for passengers yet . The Roboscan 2M Aeria is being developed by Romanian company MB Telecom (MBT). It costs €3 million (£2.1 million, $3.2 million), reported The Times, and is apparently already being used to check trucks at borders in Eastern Europe, where it has helped seize 76,000 packs of illegal cigarettes. On its website, MBT says the Aeria is ‘the very first solution for aircraft security inspection.’ It can scan planes from small private jets to medium-sized commercial airplanes. The company notes that, while passengers and their luggage are thoroughly inspected at airports, there is no such inspection process for jets arriving at small private airports with low security. But with their device, the company says this ‘gap’ in aviation security can be plugged, and it can scan an entire plane in about 20 minutes. The device can be used to detect weapons (shown) and other contraband in small or medium-sized jets that land at low-security airports . An operator working inside the truck can look inside the entirety of a plane, although currently under regulations some areas of the plane - such as the fuselage and wings - are restricted . There are four main components that allow an aircraft to be scanned. Armed with a sharp sense of smell, dogs have a long history of detecting explosives for their human handlers, and soon there could be sniffer elephants too. Researchers have found that the large mammals excel at identifying explosives by smell, stirring speculation about whether their extraordinary ability could save lives. Elephants could be used to detect land mines in areas that have seen conflict and could even do so at a distance with the aid of drones. The research was conducted in South Africa and involved the U.S. military. The first is the operating truck, from which an operator can use the system and look inside the plane. Attached to this is a robotic arm with an X-ray generator at the end. The plane is then pulled forwards by a battery-operated tug over a wide detection module. By firing X-rays out of the arm, a cone of radiation sweeps over the plane. The operator inside the truck is then given live images of the interior of the plane, and is able to scan its entirety for hidden items. It is apparently so accurate that it could pick out keys on a seat or even a filament in a light bulb. One issue, though, is that aircraft operators do not authorities to inspect the whole plane - areas of the fuselage and the wings are off limits, even though Roboscan can examine these areas. ‘You cannot touch it, but you can scan it,’ said Radu Tudor of MBT at the Counter Terror Expo in London this week.

"The Ministry of Defence was under fire after vital details of the RAF's main base on the Falklands Islands were published on their website. The secret document, which has the exact GPS co-ordinates of vital facilities as well as information on the depth of concrete on the runway were published unencrypted on the MoD's website. The details could be used as 'an invasion guide' by Argentina, with the technical information providing excellent intelligence to any Argentine bombers sent to attack the islands. The Falklands Islands are defended by a squadron of RAF Typhoon aircraft operating from Mount Pleasant aerodrome on West Falkland, supported by a refueling tanker to extend their operational area . The aerodrome also operates as a Search and Rescue location with Sea King helicopters, pictured . The airstrip, pictured, is home to four Europfighter Typhoon aircraft tasked with defending the islands . The Aerodrome Manual was accidentally uploaded onto a public section of the MoD's website and could have been downloaded by Argentine intelligence agents to help prepare a mission to recapture the islands. A senior military source told The Express: 'This is exactly the kind of intel foreign powers send spies to get. 'It's practically an invasion handbook. Taking out the runway could cripple Britain's ability to fight off invaders in the ongoing sovereignty dispute.' The MoD admitted the manual had been available on the internet but the link had been disabled. They denied the information was particularly sensitive. The blunder occurred as Argentina was described as a 'very live threat' by Defence Secretary Michael Fallon. This comes as Argentina is preparing to lease 12 Sukhoi SU-24 long-range bombers from Russia. The Falklands Islands are defended by modern Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft, supported by Rapier surface-to-air missiles and 1,200 troops. The Royal Navy also patrols the area and nuclear-powered submarines are also thought regularly travel to the region. And the MoD recently announced the £228million purchase of new anti-aircraft missiles to boost island defences. The jets are housed in hangers just off the main runway where they can be airborne quickly to intercept any potential aircraft inbound from Argentina in the event of a new conflict . Argentina is considering leasing 12 Suhkoi SU-24 bombers, pictured, from Russia. The Cold War-era jets have a range of 650 miles and would be able to bomb Mount Pleasant without the need to refuel . The MoD published the Aerodrome Manual on their website where it could be downloaded by anyone . The Cold War-era jet has a maximum range of 650 miles - which means it could attack the Falklands Islands and return to Argentina without the need to refuel. It also can carry 3,000kg of bombs as well as air-to-air missiles. The jets, despite being designed in the 1960s, are also capable of supersonic travel. This comes as tensions between Britain and Argentina have increased over plans by UK firms to drill for oil in the South Atlantic. Argentina's minister for the Malivinas - the name it uses for the Falklands Islands - Daniel Filmus threatened to prosecute any British firms exploring for oil near the islands. He said: 'The new exploration efforts to try to find hydrocarbons in the area carry a huge environmental risk. 'We want the owners of the companies to be tried according to Argentine laws and international statutes.' A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We have always been very clear that this is an unlawful assertion of jurisdiction over the Falklands Islands' continental shelf, which we reject, and we will raise it will the appropriate authorities. 'We are satisfied that the Islands have the right to develop their hydrocarbons sector as a legitimate commercial venture with international oil and gas companies, and will continue to support them as they move forward. Argentine domestic law does not apply to the Falkland Islands.'","The MoD accidentally published information on Falklands RAF base online .

"(CNN)Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin signed a bill on Friday that would allow the state to perform executions with nitrogen gas if lethal injection is ruled unconstitutional or becomes unavailable. Nitrogen causes a quick loss of consciousness and then death from lack of oxygen, Fallin's office said in a press release. CNN affiliate KFOR says it's never been used in an execution in the United States. ""The person will become unconscious within eight to 10 seconds and death a few minutes later. In other words, a humane, quick and painless death,"" said Rep. Mike Christian, one of the bill's authors, according to KFOR. Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, told the Washington Post that the same ""painless"" argument had been used to advance the use of lethal injections. ""The hasty manner in which this bill sped into law reflects the same lack of care with which Oklahoma has managed its execution process historically,"" he said. Oklahoma's executions have been put on hold while the U.S. Supreme Court reviews its use of lethal injections. Last year, the state came under scrutiny when it took 43 minutes to kill convicted killer Clayton Lockett. Fallin reaffirmed her support for the death penalty. ""Oklahoma executes murderers whose crimes are especially heinous,"" Fallin said. ""I support that policy, and I believe capital punishment must be performed effectively and without cruelty. The bill I signed today gives the state of Oklahoma another death penalty option that meets that standard."" The governor's office said the first alternative for execution is lethal injection, followed by nitrogen gas, the electric chair and the firing squad.","Nitrogen gas causes a quick loss of consciousness and then death from lack of oxygen, Oklahoma says .

"Attack: Sam Barton, who has had £55,000 of cosmetic surgery to look like Joey Essex, was egged on Easter Monday (pictured) 'Britain's vainest man' who had taxpayer-funded plastic surgery  to look like reality star Joey Essex said today he is being bullied online by a gang who have now  thrown eggs in his face. Sam Barton, who has had £55,000 of cosmetic surgery  - including two operations on the NHS - believes the culprits tracked him down using his Facebook posts and then attacked him in the street. The 22-year-old says abuse online about his appearance also forced him to move house. On Easter Monday he was attacked by a group of men who pelted him with eggs from a car. Sam had been enjoying a drink in the Green House pub in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, when a group of men shouted abuse at him as he left. The yobs then hurled six eggs at him before speeding off - leaving him with yolk and shell running down his face on the pavement. Sam said he believed he had been targeted because he had 'checked in' at the pub on Facebook minutes earlier. He said: 'It was quite a shock at first. I had just left the pub with two friends when I was suddenly pelted in eggs. 'There was shell in my hair and yolk dripping down my face. 'They shouted my name and swore at me as they drove past and threw eggs at me. 'They clearly didn't like me. It was not the kind of egg I was hoping to receive over the Easter holiday but after the shock had worn off I did have a laugh about it.' Scroll down for video . Sam had been taking part in filming with Geordie Shore star Vicky Pattison on Saturday April 4 - just two days before he was attacked. Spending: Barton has spent £20,000 on treatment for his teeth, around £5,000 on Botox, £2,000 on waxing and £2,500 on tanning treatment. Two nose jobs have cost £10,400, although one was free on the NHS . Pursuit of celebrity: Sam Barton has gone bankrupt financing plastic surgery and a champagne lifestyle to match his TOWIE heroes Joey Essex, together left, and Harry Derbidge, right . The pair spent the day being pampered at a beauty salon and then enjoying drinks in Birmingham for a reality show which will be aired on MTV. Debts: Barton admits he had debts of £100,000 on 15 credit cards and store cards trying to make it as a celeb . He also recently appeared on popular ITV show Judge Rinder to resolve a wrangle with a lapdancer friend over a Botox treatment row. Sam, who has spent £55,000 on perfecting his look, revealed in January he was going bankrupt after racking up debts of £35,000 on his Champagne lifestyle. Sam is the grandson of Aston Villa's European Cup winning boss Tony Barton and is best friends with Benefits Street star White Dee. Fame-hungry Sam previously revealed he had spent £55,000 on reconstructive surgery and beauty treatments to turn himself into the 'perfect man.' And he has amassed credit card debts of £25,000 in four years in search of the Joey Essex look that he hopes will make him a star. He has spent £20,000 on treatment for his teeth, around £5,000 on Botox, £2,000 on waxing and £2,500 on tanning treatment. Two nose jobs have cost £10,400, although one was free on the NHS. He admitted spending an astonishing £100,000 in just four years, blowing up to £2,000 a night on £300 bottles of expensive fizz. Sam, who lives with mum Jackie, dad Chris and brother Ed in Sutton Coldfield, plunged into the red after spending a fortune on plastic surgery. He added: 'I've spent around £55,000 trying to improve my looks and get the perfect image. 'The rest I've spent on designer clothes, jewellery, holidays, spa treatment and champagne. 'In total, I have spent around £100,000. At one point I counted 15 credit cards and store cards. 'I really do not regret it, I have had the time of my life over the last few years. 'My manager says this bankruptcy thing will clear my debts, so it's basically free money isn't it?' Sam, who is best pals with Benefits Street's White Dee, is now setting his sights on a place in the Big Brother house this summer.","Sam Barton had £55,000 of plastic surgery including two NHS operations .

"David Cameron will launch a multi-billion pound sale of Lloyds Bank shares if he wins the Election – in what would be the largest privatisation bonanza since the Thatcher era. The Prime Minister will today pledge that if he is returned to Downing Street he will offer the public £4 billion of Lloyds shares still held by the Government after Gordon Brown’s £20 billion panic bailout with taxpayers’ money during the 2008 economic crisis. Individuals will be allowed to buy up to £10,000 worth of Lloyds Banking Group shares, which were worth 78.7p when the stock market closed on Friday – comfortably above the 73.6p paid by Mr Brown’s government. Scroll down for video . David Cameron will launch a multi-billion pound sale of Lloyds Bank shares if he wins the Election . The shares will be offered at a discount of at least 5 per cent on the market rate at the time, with the proceeds used to help pay down the national debt. It is the latest ‘retro’ Conservative policy to hark back to the 1980s, following Mr Cameron’s revival in the manifesto of the Thatcherite ‘Right to Buy’ offer for housing association tenants. But while investors 30 years ago took overnight profits on their stakes in privatised companies such as British Gas and British Telecom – leading critics to claim that it encouraged ‘carpetbaggers’ – Lloyds shareholders will be encouraged to hang on to their holding. A loyalty bonus will be offered of one free share for every ten held for at least a year after the sale, up to a maximum bonus value of £200. The sale of Lloyds shares would be the biggest privatisation since the 1980s when Mrs Thatcher’s government sold £3.9 billion of BT shares and £5.6 billion of British Gas shares in the famous ‘Tell Sid’ campaign. Thirty-three major companies were privatised under Mrs Thatcher between 1984 and 1991, which supporters said led to a dramatic improvement in their efficiency and a boost to tax revenues for the Treasury. Like Right to Buy, it also helped to entrench Tory support among voters who benefited from the windfalls. No 10 strategists hope Mr Cameron’s pledge will remind voters of the economic problems that blighted the country under Mr Brown’s premiership. The recovery under Chancellor George Osborne has allowed him to sell £9 billion of shares in Lloyds to City investors for more than the price that former chancellor Alistair Darling paid in 2008. CLAIM: Jesse Norman and the chocolate cake he allegedly gave out while campaigning for re-election . Police are investigating a Tory MP over claims he attempted to bribe voters with chocolate cake. Jesse Norman allegedly gave out cake while campaigning for re-election at an Asda supermarket in his Hereford constituency. West Mercia Police last night said it was investigating reports of a breach of the Representation of the People Act 1983, which bans Election candidates from providing food, drink or entertainment in a bid to win votes. The probe follows would-be Ukip MP Kim Rose, who is standing in Southampton Itchen, being grilled by police for giving out sausage rolls at a party event earlier this year. Detectives are expected to speak to Mr Norman after he was photographed with trays of baked goods on April 2. He described the allegations as ‘nonsense’, saying: ‘We had a couple of small boxes of chocolate muffins ... we may have given out one or two to children, who are not even voters.’ There have been two sales to big pension funds and City institutions in 2013 and early in 2014. Late last year, UK Financial Investments, the Treasury body that manages the Government stake, hired investment bank Morgan Stanley to sell a few million Lloyds shares in the market every day over a six month period – a practice known as a ‘dribble-out’. The Government still owns £12.5 billion of Lloyds shares and experts expect £4 billion worth to be offered to the public, with the rest sold to City institutions. With the share price currently above 78p, the Tories will be able claim they have banked a profit running into billions for the taxpayer. However, while Lloyds has been a success story, the Government’s other big bank investment – Royal Bank of Scotland – has not. The Treasury under Mr Brown paid an average of 502p a share for RBS when it was rescued. They were changing hands on Friday for 349p. In Mr Cameron’s announcement today, he is expected to say: ‘The £20 billion bailout of Lloyds Bank by the last Labour government became a symbol of the crisis that engulfed the British economy under Labour. After the public bailed it out, people feared they wouldn’t see their money returned. Today they are. ‘Today’s announcement marks another step in the long journey we have been making repairing our banks, turning our economy around and reducing our national debt, only made possible by our long-term economic plan. ‘That’s why it is so important that we don’t put all that progress at risk, but instead build on what we’ve done so we can deliver a brighter, more secure future for our country.’ COUNTRY LIFE: A 'beater' at work and below,  a bottle of Sipsmith Dry Gin . The Prime Minister indulged his love of country sports by taking part in a secret country shoot near his Oxfordshire constituency home. And he celebrated with a nip of a specially prepared ‘Chipping Norton’ cocktail. But witnesses say that David Cameron did not himself use a gun – despite his reputation as a skilled marksman. Instead, he acted as a ‘beater’ to flush out the game. The event took place on New Year’s Eve but until now has been kept a closely guarded secret. It took place near Chipping Norton, the Oxfordshire town which has given its name to the ‘Chipping Norton set’ of high-profile local residents from the world of politics, media and showbusiness such as Mr Cameron and Jeremy Clarkson. Last night, the man who served Mr Cameron the cocktail said other people on what he described as a ‘country walk’ had no idea there would be a VIP guest. Jared Brown, master distiller at the West London ‘artisanal’ gin company Sipsmith, said: ‘No one but the landowner knew the Prime Minister would be joining us.’ He fought shy of describing the event as a shoot, but added: ‘I can say with utter certainty that Mr Cameron did not handle a gun.’ Mr Brown confirmed, though, that the PM did sample the cocktail, based on Sipsmith London Dry Gin. Last night, the drink, also containing manuka honey, raspberry tea and extract of echinacea, was being dubbed the ‘Chipping Norton cocktail’.","David Cameron will pledge to sell Lloyds shares if he wins the election .

"The son of a Syrian imam who was shot dead on a London street may have met his father’s killer just days before the murder. Sources close to the investigation, which is being led by the counter-terrorism unit, told the Sunday Times that Abdul Hadi Arwani, an opponent of Syrian President Bahsar Al-Assad, had visited the area where he was killed with his son days before his death. Arwani, 48, was shot and killed in his car on a quiet street in North West London after being called there last Tuesday, apparently to provide a quote for building work. Scroll down for video . imam, Abdul Hadi Arwani (pictured), was called to a job in the area he was killed days before his death . When the imam, who had links to the Muslim Brotherhood in the UK and abroad, arrived to the house with his son and not on his own, the supposed potential client asked Arwani to come back another day. The man was identified as black and speaking with an African accent. He pretended to have lost his keys which is why he asked Arwani, a part-time builder, to return later. The Sunday Telegraph reported that the man, who has not been otherwise been identified, also told the imam that there was no need for his son to accompany him again when he did come back. Arwani's children are in little doubt their father was killed by the man asking for the building quote. Scotland Yard is looking into whether the man was a hired killer who postponed the hit because because Arwani was not alone. The counter-terrorism unit has special expertise relating to politically motivated assassinations but they are also keeping other lines of inquiry open. Aspects of Arwani’s personal life as well as his financial standing are being considered. The Syrian-born activist and imam died of multiple gunshot wounds to the chest sustained near to the junction of the Paddocks and Greenhill, Wembley. His car was parked on what has been described as a blind bend, just out of sight of CCTV. Home: Mr Arwani, originally from Syria, lived in this home in White City, west London . Arwani’s VW Passat was parked neatly on the side of the road with its engine still running and one window wound down when his body was found . Neighbours, nearby at the time of the murder, have said they did not hear any shots fired, indicating, perhaps, that the killer used a silencer. Arwani’s VW Passat was parked neatly on the side of the road with its engine still running and one window wound down when his body was found. The Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist political group to which Arwani had long-standing links, is outlawed in many Middle Eastern countries. One Syrian opposition activist has said despite Arwami’s standing and his participation in protests against the Assad regime in London in 2012 (pictured) the imam was an unlikely target for assassination . One of the imam’s friends was quoted as saying that Arwani left the group in an official capacity ‘seven or eight years ago’ but had kept ties with some of the group’s senior figures. One Muslim Brotherhood leader, Ali Sadraddine Al-Bayanouni attended a gathering in remembrance of Arwani in the capital last week. Described as ‘non-violent Islamist’ by his family Arwani had links to a number of controversial preachers. Among them was Abu Qatada, deported to Jordan and dubbed Osama Bin Laden’s man in Europe. Arwani also campaigned against the extradition of the hook-welding preacher Abu Hamzr for offences related to terrorism. Despite the connections there is nothing to suggest Arwani was anything more than a peaceful moderate. Leaving Syria in 1982 during the last, failed uprising against the Assad regime, Arwami moved to Britain in the mid 1990s. He studied Islamic Sharia in Jordan where he claimed to have been sentenced to death in his absence by Syrian authorities. One Syrian opposition activist has said despite Arwani’s standing and his participation in protests against the Assad regime in London in 2012 the imam was an unlikely target for assassination. Imam: Mr Arwani was a preacher at the An-Noor Mosque (pictured) in Acton, West London, which has a reputation for hosting fundamentalist speakers . Hassan Anywabwile (pictured) from Trinidad and Tobago was brought in to replace Arwani at the An-Noor Mosque . Bassam Tablieh, a solicitor and opponent of the Syrian government, said there were many more obvious, high priority targets for Syrian authorities to go after in London. Police are also looking into a row over finances and transparency which led to Arwani being ousted from the An-Noor mosque in Acton where he was imam up until 2011. He was replaced at his mosque by a Caribbean preacher involved in an attempted coup d'état 25 years ago. Hassan Anywabwile from Trinidad and Tobago was brought in to replace Arwani at the An-Noor Mosque. Anywabwile's name appears in the Caribbean nation's parliamentary documents surrounding a violent coup attempt in 1990 by Muslim group Jamaat al Muslimeen It is understood that Arwani wanted to register the mosque as a charity with trustees, moving it away from its current status whereby the Acton mosque operates as a company. While the building for the mosque was bought for £1 million, raised in contributions from a number of members of the community, land registry records state the sole owner to be Khalid Rashad, one of the mosque’s founders, through a firm called ‘Brickridge’. The murdered imam had reportedly begun legal proceedings in the high court over the dispute. Rashad, 61, a Muslim convert from Wembley refused to comment on the row or Arwani’s decision to leave the mosque. He referred to a statement that expressed ‘great sadness’ at the imam’s death. It has not been suggested that any members of the mosque were involved in the murder.","Imam Abdul Hadi Arwani called to a building job in the area he was killed .

"John Carver knows only too well that a Tyne-Wear derby can make or break a manager. His first in the dugout was as assistant to Ruud Gullit in August, 1999, when on a sodden night at St James' Park the Dutchman left out Alan Shearer and Duncan Ferguson and paid for his selection with his job after a 2-1 defeat. Carver is now fighting to win the head coach position beyond the end of this season and knows what impact a victory – or a loss – could have on Sunday afternoon. John Carver is relishing the chance to take charge of his hometown club against Sunderland on Sunday . Gullit controversially decided not to start star players Duncan Ferguson and Alan Shearer in 1999 . Carver was assistant to former Newcastle manager Ruud Gullit who managed the club between 1998 and 1999 . His memories of Gullit's downfall remind him of such consequences. 'We were at the old training ground at Durham Cricket Club and I was in the room with Steve Clarke and Ruud,' recalls Carver. 'All of a sudden, he started talking about what the team was going to be against Sunderland. I said, 'Sorry Ruud, what did you say there?'. 'He said he was going to leave out Alan and Duncan. I said, 'Do you know how important this game is?'. 'He said, 'I have played in some massive derbies. I've played in them in Holland and London and I played in the Milan derby too'. 'I said, 'Yeah, but you haven't played in one like this Ruud'. 'And then we just walked out of the room. He seemed set on the fact that was what he was going to do. 'I talked about it being a motivation for the opposition seeing Alan and Duncan on the bench. But he had no concerns whatsoever. 'I actually thought, 'If we don't win it, he's gone'. I said to Steve, 'Is he writing his resignation before the game?'. Gullit's selection gambit did not pay off and Newcastle ended up losing 2-1 to Sunderland at St James' Park . 'We actually went 1-0 up but they turned it around and then the heavens opened. It was a dreadful night.' The following morning Shearer went to see Gullit, only Ferguson had beaten him to it, knocking the door off the hinges, legend has it. By the end of the week he had quit. Carver was also by Alan Pardew's side during the last four derby defeats, a factor the former manager admits did him little favours with the Toon Army. In that respect, Carver knows how much a positive result could aid his chances of landing the job on a permanent basis. 'In the eyes of the fans, if you win a derby game, it's massive,' he said. 'I'm not saying everything else is forgotten, but it certainly helps your case. If I come off and it's not been a football match but we win 1-0, I'll be delighted with that. 'We had a good football match last weekend (2-1 defeat at home to Arsenal) and got nothing for it. At the end of the day, it's all about getting the win.'

"(CNN)If you're famous and performing the American national anthem, be prepared to become a national hero or a national disgrace. Facts are facts.  Just ask Vince, Whitney, Roseanne, Jimi and Michael. Mötley Crüe's Vince Neil reminded us again this week of the dangers of tackling ""The Star-Spangled Banner."" Sure, he can shred it on ""Girls, Girls, Girls"" and ""Dr. Feelgood,"" but this is a different story -- a completely different story. To say Neil butchered the song before the Las Vegas Outlaws Arena Football League game would be unkind to those in the profession.  There's less carnage when butchers are done with their work. The late Whitney Houston set the modern standard for the national anthem at Super Bowl XXV.  In the early stages of the Gulf War in 1991, a patriotic America saluted her performance. Just six months earlier, comedian Roseanne Barr may have established the low-water mark. The crowd at the San Diego Padres game booed her rendition and President George H. W. Bush called it ""disgraceful."" There's nothing quite like getting the presidential thumbs down. One of the most controversial and beloved versions of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" comes from 1969. Guitar slinger Jimi Hendrix inflamed mainstream America with his psychedelic take on the national anthem to the delight of the Woodstock generation. And then there's Michael Bolton's version.  Overly wrought songs are his specialty and he doesn't disappoint in that department when he sings at the American League Championship Series in 2003.  Bolton belts it out, but there's one little problem -- the words.  Can anyone say crib notes?","Singing the national anthem is a risky proposition .

Angela Moore, a publicist for Claudette King, said later in the day that he was back home resting and enjoying time with his grandchildren. ""He was struggling before, and he is a trouper,"" Moore said. ""He wasn't going to let his fans down."" No more information on King's condition or where he was hospitalized was immediately available. B.B. is short for Blues Boy, part of the name he used as a Memphis disc jockey, the Beale Street Blues Boy. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987, and has 30 Grammy nominations. King, 89, has used various models of Gibson guitars over the years, and named each one of them Lucille. In the 1980s, Gibson officially dropped the model number on the guitar he used last and most. It became a custom-made signature model named Lucille, manufactured exclusively for the ""King of the Blues."" Some of his hits include ""The Thrill Is Gone,"" which won him his first Grammy in 1970, ""There Must be a Better World Somewhere"" and ""When Love Comes to Town,"" a collaboration with U2. Last year, the bluesman suffered from dehydration and exhaustion after a show in Chicago, forcing him to cancel the remainder of his tour.

"At least one is dead after a powerful storm capsized several sailboats participating in a regatta, and crews searched late on Saturday for at least four people missing in the waters, the Coast Guard said. The storm rolled through the area about 4 p.m. and a man was plucked from the waters by the Coast Guard around 9 p.m., Petty officer Carlos Vega said. He said crews would search through the night. 'We knew we were totally lost at sea,' said regatta participant Rhonda Morgan Gilreath, right, shown with her boyfriend Randy Rutledge of Rome Georgia on Saturday . Dauphin Island Regatta sailors gather near their docked sailboats on Saturday, April 25, 2015, in Dauphin Island, Alabama where Coast Guard officials said they responded to a report of multiple capsized vessels . More than 100 sailboats and as many as 200 people were participating in the Dauphin Island regatta in Mobile Bay. Dauphin Island Mayor Jeff Collier told Al.com  that at least one person was confirmed dead, but he did not know the cause. 'It's been a very tragic day,' Michael Smith, with the Buccaneer yacht club, told WSFA-TV. 'We've had a lot of breakage, missing people, fatalities.' Susan Kangal, who was on a boat, told WSFA it was the worst storm that she has seen. 'We were probably an inch from capsizing; everybody was ready to jump. I didn't have a life jacket on,' she said. The boats were part of the 57th iteration of the race. Scattered boats: 'They were scattered anywhere from Dauphin Island Bridge all the way out into Mobile Bay and across to Fort Morgan. It was a wide area,' said Dauphin Island Mayor Jeff Collier . Feeling blessed: Well-wishers congratulate regatta participant Robert Luiten of Mobile, Alabama, in blue shirt, on word that his son, Leonard Luiten, was found several hours after their boat capsized in a storm on Saturday . 'Apparently there were a number of vessels that became distressed, either capsized or what have you,' the mayor said. 'They were scattered anywhere from Dauphin Island Bridge all the way out into Mobile Bay and across to Fort Morgan. It was a wide area,' said Dauphin Island Mayor Jeff Collier. AL.com reports that Richard Mather, 52, of Mobile, was aboard a 39-foot O'Day sailboat along with seven people, when he saw two boats collide. He said that they expected thunderstorms but not as severe as they were. 'But we were not prepared for a gale,' Mather said, 'which is almost like a 30-minute hurricane.' Mather wasn't in the race and was able to pull three people onto his vessel about two miles north of the Dauphin Island Bridge. He said the boaters seemed extremely tired but none of them were injured. 'They were exhausted but they were fine,' he said. 'Their boats sunk so fast that they didn't have time to grab life preservers.'","A powerful storm capsized several sailboats participating in a regatta, and crews searched for at least four people missing in the waters .

"Beaten FA Cup semi-finalists Reading lost again as they were defeated by Birmingham in a scrappy Sky Bet Championship game at the Madejski Stadium on Wednesday night. Although Reading dominated most of the match, they wasted several chances in the closing stages of the first half. Birmingham held firm and grabbed the winner seven minutes from the end, when Clayton Donaldson nodded in his 16th goal of the season. Clayton Donaldson (left) scored a late headed winner for Birmingham City as his side defeated Reading 1-0 . Donaldson, who signed from Brentford in the summer, scored his 16th goal of the season . READING: Federici, Gunter, Cooper, Hector, Ake, McCleary (Appiah 63), Karacan, Chalobah, Obita, Mackie (Stacey 63), Blackman (Novakovich 81) Subs not used: Kelly, Norwood, Akpan, Andersen .

Referee: Lee Mason . Attendance: 14,604 . Reading were involved in a dramatic 2-1 defeat against Arsenal, after extra-time, in the last four of the Cup at Wembley on Saturday. Goalkeeper Adam Federici, whose fumble led to Alexis Sanchez's winning goal, was retained against Birmingham - as were six of his fellow starters from Wembley. At least Reading had no pressure on them, the last lingering doubts of relegation having been removed when Millwall lost 2-0 at Blackburn Rovers on Tuesday night. Birmingham had little to play for either, apart from trying to improve on a poor recent record of just two wins in eight league matches. A predictably dour opening, with neither side keen to force the pace, ended when Wes Thomas aimed at Federici. But it was a weak effort that did not trouble the Australian goalkeeper. Reading, with only two wins in 13 league games behind them and no wins in six, responded swiftly as the game warmed up. Garath McCleary, scorer of Reading's equaliser against Arsenal, fired wide after a long pass from Jake Cooper. A Cooper header lacked the power to test Birmingham keeper Darren Randolph, Jamie Mackie shot wide after Jem Karacan had been blocked out, and Mackie and Nick Blackman had close-range efforts cleared to safety. Randolph made a flying save to keep out a fierce McCleary shot and the keeper also had to stop two decent long-range attempts from Nathaniel Chalobah. Reading fans showed their support for Adam Federci following his blunder at Wembley on Saturday . Donaldson goes one-on-one with Federici, who was hoping to make amends for his mistake against Arsenal . Birmingham threatened only rarely, Paul Caddis blazing over from a Diego Fabbrini cross, which Donaldson had missed, and Jonathan Grounds heading straight at Federici from a Caddis corner. Reading kept up the momentum after the interval but, as Birmingham defended stubbornly, the home side spoiled good approach work with poor final touches. Nathan Ake did manage to fashion a chance when wriggling clear of his markers but drove straight at Randolph. Reading lost their second game in as many matches as their poor Championship form continues . Birmingham continued to sit back, inviting the pressure. Jordan Obita missed with a powerful drive and then drilled over a low cross that no team-mate was able to reach. Andrew Shinnie was off target from distance but Reading regained the upper hand with efforts from Chalobah, a 20-yard shot saved by Randolph, substitute Jack Stacey and Ake. Birmingham rallied late on, with Federici having to make two smart saves to deny substitute Demarai Gray. And the visitors broke the deadlock in the 83rd minute. Stephen Gleeson delivered a corner from the left and Donaldson rose unchallenged to glance a header past the helpless Federici.","Reading are 18th in the Championship while Birmingham City sit in 15th .

"In a matter of moments, Samantha Rawcliffe was catapulted towards an uncertain future. Without warning, the mother-of-two lost all control of her body while she was behind the wheel of her car. Gripped by what would later be diagnosed as a rare brain disorder, the 40-year-old crashed. She blamed her uncontrollable shaking in the aftermath of the accident on her shock. But over the following days, when she lost control of her bladder repeatedly, she feared something else was to blame. Tests revealed she was suffering functional neurological disorder - an umbrella term for a wide variety of neurological symptoms that doctors cannot explain. Samantha Rawcliffe, 40, from Morecambe, has been diagnosed with the rare condition functional neurological disorder - an umbrella term to cover a range of neurological symptoms . The mother-of-two suddenly lost all control of her body and crashed her car last May. In the days after the accident she lost control of her bladder and was shaking uncontrollably . 'It wasn't a bad accident, but I went home shaken and had a drink,' she said. 'I just couldn't stop shaking. 'The next day I wet myself and I wet the bed for the next three nights. 'But I didn't know what was wrong with me, and thought I had a trapped nerve or something like that. 'Even a year on, I have no feeling in my bladder, and I don't know when I need the toilet or even when I am actually weeing. 'There is no sign that will ever return. 'When I was told I had FND, I didn't even know what  it was and it just isn't out there, it's so rare.' Following her accident on May 26, last year, Mrs Rawcliffe was taken to the Royal Preston Hospital to meet neurologists. They eventually diagnosed the rare illness functional neurological disorder in September, following a series of tests. Last September doctors diagnosed the rare brain disorder. Mrs Rawcliffe is now confined to her house, unable to walk and relies on a mobility scooter. Each day she has to take a cocktail of 32 different drugs . Mrs Rawcliffe, from Morecambe, has since had to give up her job as a teaching assistant, and can no longer drive. She struggles to walk further than eight metres, and relies on a mobility scooter to get around. Functional neurological disorder is an umbrella term that covers a variety of symptoms that cannot be explained. The condition can be as debilitating as Parkinson's disease and MS, and may share many common symptoms. Very few effective treatment plans exist. Physical therapy is often the most effective form of treatment, with the aim of reintroducing proper movement and motor control. Many patients are also prescribed cognitive behaviour therapy. The condition can cause the following symptoms: . Source: FND Hope . The 40-year-old spends most of her time confined to her home, and has to take 32 tablets each day to prevent choking fits and tremors. 'Life is quite boring and I can't do anything myself whether it's washing, showering, cooking cleaning,' she said. 'Before I was diagnosed I was going to the gym five times a week and I loved my job. I'm 40 - I never wanted to retire. 'In fact, I get quite tearful when I think about it and my old colleagues always say there is a hole where Sam should be at work. 'I've got no independence anymore and I sold my car in the end because I was sick of looking at it.' Doctors cannot determine whether the condition had been lying dormant in Mrs Rawcliffe's body before it revealed itself. She suffered a mini-stroke as a teenager but recovered within three weeks and met her husband Phillip a few months later. Despite back pain from another car accident 12 years ago, the mother-of-two has not suffered any other ailments. Power plant technician Phillip, 47, and the couple's children Rhys, 19 and Rebecca, 17, have rallied to help. 'I think the kids took it hard at first - there was a lot of crying,' Mrs Rawcliffe said. 'But I have a big family and support network and they have all adapted so brilliantly. 'I used to be the life and soul of the party and I've never been a miserable person but there is so much that I can't do and it's hard to take. 'I end up kind of mourning for the life that I had had before this.' Mrs Rawcliffe is hoping to raise awareness of the condition by drumming up funds for the organisation FND Hope to help boost support for sufferers.

"Police in Houston say a 34-year-old man got behind the wheel of his car while under the influence Sunday, leaving a path of destruction in his wake and killing two people, one of them a 6-year-old boy. Blaine Boudreaux has been charged with intoxication manslaughter, intoxicated assault and failure to stop and render aid involving death in connection to at least three separate DUI collisions that took place within three hours in Houston. Boudreaux, who also has an extensive DUI record in his native Louisiana, was allegedly drunk when he ran a red light on Lockwood Drive at around 6.3opm and slammed his Dodge pickup truck into a Honda Civic. Path of destruction: Blaine Boudreaux (left), 34, has been charged in connection to three separate DUI crashes in Houston that killed 6-year-old Josh Medrano, injured his mother and led to the death of a homeless man . Heartbroken: The family of 6-year-old Joshua Medrano are seen Wednesday leaving the courtroom where Blaine Boudreaux made an appearance on charges stemming from a trio of accidents in Houston. On of the boy's relatives screamed at the suspect: 'I hope you die!' Joshua Medrano, 6, who was a passenger in the sedan, was fatally injured. His mother, Cynthia, was hospitalized with a punctured lung and broken bones. Boudreaux was arrested at the scene after failing a field sobriety test. Three wrecks: The 34-year-old, who has a history of DUIs in Louisiana, is also accused of crashing into another car carrying a woman and a toddler . Several hours earlier, according to police, the 34-year-old man struck and killed 61-year-old vagrant Leonard Batiste walking along Texas 5 Spur near the University of Houston. Investigators say the homeless man was mowed down at around 5.15pm Sunday but his body was not discovered until Monday afternoon. Boudreaux’s entire bumper, complete with his license plate, was found nearby. Blaine Boudreaux also has been linked to a third collision that occurred about two hours before Batiste's death. The two-car crash took place in the 6600 block of Fannin Street and involved a mother and her 2-year-old child, who were taken to a hospital and later released. In that case, Boudreaux was issued a ticket by a police officer and allowed to leave the scene. After slamming into the elderly man on Texas 5 Spur, Boudreaux allegedly dozed off behind the wheel and didn't wake up until another driver honked at him to get his attention. That is when he ran the red light at the intersection of Lockwood and the East Freeway and slammed into Cynthia Medrano's black Honda, killing her son, according to officials. Joseph Rodriguez, the boy's stepfather, said little Joshua wanted to become a firefighter when he grew up. Rodriguez said the officer who stopped Boudreaux after the first accident involving the mother and toddler should have detained him instead of letting the man go. Prosecutor Alison Baimbridge told the Houston Chronicle investigators are now looking into that collision and resulting citation in light of Boudreaux's apparent intoxication about two hours. Cynthia Medrano, pictured here with her family, was driving Sunday evening with her young son in the passenger seat when police say Boudreaux ran a red light and plowed into her Honda Civic . Doomed: Even though the 6-year-old was buckled in, he suffered fatal injuries and died upon arriving at a hospital . When questioned by police after his arrest, Boudreaux allegedly admitted that he had taken anti-depressants and a drug used to treat addiction to opiates before getting behind the wheel of his pickup truck Sunday afternoon. Blaine Boudreaux, a Catholic school dropout who moved to Houston in his late teens, has recently lost his home security business and allowed his pharmacy technician license to lapse, reported the Chronicle. During his arraignment Wednesday morning, prosecutors revealed that the suspect has multiple outstanding warrants for DUIs in Louisiana. In one case, he also had jumped bail. In light of these facts, his bond was set at $100,000 on each of the three counts, reported the station KTRK. Boudreaux’s arraignment was attended by several members of Joshua Medrano's family who sobbed in court and showed Boudreaux the middle finger. One woman cried out 'I hope you die!' as the suspect clad in an orange jumpsuit was being led out of the courtroom.

"Pep Guardiola has denied claims of a dispute with former Bayern Munich club doctor Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt, who quit the club on Thursday after 'being blamed' for the defeat by Porto. The 72-year-old, who had worked at Bayern for almost 40 years, sensationally quit the Bundesliga club, claiming 'the bond of trust is damaged', but Guardiola has played down claims of a feud. 'The reaction is on me, I was disappointed,' he told reporters in the wake of a shock Champions League quarter-final defeat by Porto. 'It was nothing to do with the doctor.

'We have players who were out a long time with injuries. Their legs don't last very long. It's a tough result to take into the second leg, but we'll give it a go.'

Bayern boss Guardiola looks perplexed as his side fall two goals behind during the early stages of the game . Guardiola also appeared to publicly humiliate Muller-Wohlfahrt eight days before his exit from the club, sarcastically clapping him when Benatia left the pitch injured. Continuing at his press conference on Thursday, Guardiola said: 'The responsibility for the defeat in Porto lies with me. Put together, my players have had 30 operations over the last two years, but we've still won the league and cup. 'We can't win every match 3-0 or 4-0 in this situation. It's impossible.'

"A Missouri inmate was executed Tuesday night for killing a man in a fit of rage over child support payments 16 years ago. Andre Cole, 52, became the third convicted killer put to death this year in Missouri. His fate was sealed after the U.S. Supreme Court turned down several appeals, including one claiming Cole was mentally ill and unfit for execution. Cole was executed by lethal injection at 10.15pm on Tuesday at the Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center in Bonne Terre, Missouri and was pronounced dead at 10.24pm, a spokesman for the Missouri Department of Corrections wrote in a statement to Daily Mail Online. Scroll down for video . Andre Cole, 52, became the third convicted killer put to death this year in Missouri . He declined to order a last meal and received the day's inmate tray meal of a turkey and bologna sandwich, a cookie and fruit punch. He did not provide a final written statement, the spokesman said. Department of Corrections Director George A. Lombardi read the following statement from Gov. Jay Nixon: 'Next week marks the observance of Crime Victims’ Rights Week in Missouri, and tonight I ask the people of our state to especially remember Anthony Curtis, murdered by the man whose sentence was carried out tonight. 'Far too often, the names of those who are victims of violent crime, such as Anthony Curtis, are the names that are forgotten. 'Please join us in keeping Anthony Curtis and his loved ones in your thoughts and prayers.' On Tuesday, Gov. Nixon refused a clemency petition that raised concerns about the fact that Cole, who was black, was convicted and sentenced by an all-white jury. Cole and his wife, Terri, were married for 11 years and had two children before divorcing in 1995. The couple fought about visitation and he was upset about child support payments, authorities said. By 1998, Cole was $3,000 behind in child support. Attorney General Chris Koster said Cole became angry when he learned that a payroll withholding order was issued to his employer, taking the money out of his check. 'Before I give her another dime, I'll kill (her),' Cole told co-workers, according to Koster. The first deduction appeared on his August 21, 1998, paycheck. Hours later, Cole forced his way into his ex-wife's home by throwing a tire jack through a glass door, Koster said. He was confronted by Curtis, a friend who was visiting. Andre Cole used a kitchen knife to repeatedly stab Curtis, then Terri Cole. Curtis died but Terri Cole survived. Cole fled the state but surrendered 33 days later. He claimed at trial that he did not bring a weapon into Terri Cole's house and that Curtis initiated the attack with a knife. Andre Cole's brother, DeAngelo Cole, 38, of Las Vegas, said the attack was out of character for his sibling. He called it a crime of passion. 'It was a one-time thing,' DeAngelo Cole said. 'He didn't have a history of that kind of behavior.' Cole's attorney, Joseph Luby, said Cole's mental health deteriorated during the more than a decade he spent in prison. He said Cole was plagued by psychosis and constantly heard voices in his head. Cole was executed by lethal injection at 10.15pm on Tuesday at the Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center (above) in Bonne Terre, Missouri . The courts were not convinced. Both the Missouri Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to halt the execution based on mental health concerns. The U.S. Supreme Court also turned away appeals based on Missouri's secretive method of obtaining the execution drug pentobarbital and over how instructions were given to the jury. The jury itself was the source of the clemency request to Nixon. Advocates for Cole, including the NAACP, the American Civil Liberties Union and others, said his case was among many in which St. Louis County prosecutors unfairly prohibited black jurors from hearing a death penalty case involving a black suspect. All 12 jurors in Cole's case were white. Kimber Edwards, who was scheduled for execution in May, was also convicted and sentenced by an all-white jury. The Missouri Supreme Court, without explanation, canceled the execution orders for Edwards earlier this month. Missouri tied Texas for the most executions in 2014 with 10. Missouri has now executed 15 men since November 2013.","Andre Cole, 52, became the third convicted killer put to death this year in Missouri and was executed by lethal injection on Tuesday .

"A woman who died suddenly was eaten by her pet dogs after her body lay undiscovered for days, an inquest was told. Noelle Baynham was found by a close friend who let himself in after she failed to answer the door. The body had been partially eaten by the Jack Russell and Staffordshire Bull Terrier, which are initially thought to have tried to wake her before becoming desperate for food. It is believed the 61-year-old from Winchester, Hampshire, collapsed and died following an accidental overdose of medication. Eaten: Noelle Baynham's dogs started to eat her remains after being locked in the house for days. The most likely cause of death was an accidental overdose, an inquest was told . However a pathologist could not determine the exact cause of death because the dogs, who were trapped in the house, ate parts of her vital organs. Concerned friend Grant Donovan made the 'horrific' discovery of her remains after nobody answered the front door at her home. He told the inquest that he could hear her two dogs barking and jumping behind the door and became concerned that there did not appear to be anyone in with them. Finding the back door unlocked, he entered the house where he said the floors were covered in dog faeces. Walking through, he then discovered Ms Baynham's body lying on the landing. 'This was the most horrifying thing I have ever seen,' he told the inquest. 'I could not look at her long, so I just came away and called 999.' Detectives who searched the house following the grim discovery, on January 17 this year, could find no evidence of a struggle or foul play. The hearing was told how former jeweller Ms Baynham was found was in her dressing gown and had run a bath just before her death. Pets: A Staffordshire Bull Terrier (left) and Jack Russell (right) like the ones owned by Noelle Baynham . Detective Constable Wesley Arnold from Hampshire Police told the coroner that scratch marks on her chest indicated that her dogs may have tried to wake her after she collapsed. Home Office pathologist Dr Amanda Jeffery reaveled that she had probably died 'a few days' before she was found, but because the dogs had eaten her organs it was impossible to establish exactly what had killed her. The 'combined effect' of a variety of drugs found in her system was likely to have been the cause of an accidental overdose, she added. The hearing was told that Ms Baynham suffered from bipolar disorder and chronic alcoholism and was prescribed a variety of medication. Blood tests found a range of drugs in her system including potentially toxic levels of painkillers. Recording an open verdict, senior central Hampshire coroner Grahame Short ruled that there was no evidence of suicide or an accidental fall, but said Ms Baynham may have had a stroke. 'The horrific element in this case is what happened after death rather than before, and it's entirely plausible that when there are dogs in the house with no one to care for them, that they will then start to eat her remains. 'That clearly was a major hindrance to Dr Jeffery in her examination, and as she's explained, she was not able to look at her important organs and she could not establish a clear cause of death. 'I have to say there's no sign to say this was a deliberate overdose. There can come a point where [the drug level over time is] just too high and one pill too many can tip over the balance.' The dogs were subsequently put down on the advice of police officers.","Jack Russell and Staffordshire Bull Terrier were trapped in house .

"A predatory convicted paedophile with an obsession with young girls has gone on the run after vanishing from a psychiatric unit. Stephen Munden, 54, described as having a 'fanatical obsession' with small girls after he targeted a toddler on a bus, has been missing since 6.15pm on Tuesday and was last seen leaving a hospital, near Hook, Hampshire. Now officers have launched a manhunt to find Munden  - who was detained under the Mental Health Act after sexually touching the three-year-old girl. A predatory convicted paedophile with an obsession with young girls has gone on the run after vanishing from a psychiatric unit. Stephen Munden, 54, (pictured with and without a beard) was last seen leaving a hospital, near Hook, Hampshire . He is described as about 5ft 8ins tall, of a heavy build, and has dark hair. Officers said they believed that Munden, who suffers from learning difficulties, may have shaved off his beard before leaving the hospital in Winchfield and have released images of him with both facial hair and a clean shave. He was detained at the private facility under a hospital order following his sentence last August for sexual offences. Munden was convicted of sexually touching a child under the age of 13. A court heard he deliberately sat near a three-year-old girl and stroked her hand with his finger - in full view of the child's mother and grandmother. Munden, formerly of Marchwood, near Southampton, denied the offence, claiming it was accidental when he appeared at Southampton Crown Court. During the sentencing David Jenkins, prosecuting, told Judge Peter Henry that the defendant had admitted ten unrelated offences of possessing or attempting to possess indecent images of children. The court heard he had been arrested after using one of the public computers at Hythe library in an attempt to download images. Mr Jenkins said children's clothes, books and dolls were found at Munden's home and added: 'He has a fanatical obsession with young girls.' A court heard he deliberately sat near a three-year-old girl and stroked her hand with his finger - in full view of the child's mother and grandmother. Munden, formerly of Marchwood, near Southampton, denied the offence, claiming it was accidental when he appeared at Southampton Crown Court . Consultant physiatrist John O'Shea said the defendant was autistic and also suffered from mild learning difficulties. He added that Munden had difficulty controlling his sexual interest in small children but the girl on the bus was probably unaware of his intentions. Keely Harvey, in mitigation, said: 'He did not accept that he deliberately touched the child's hand.' But the judge said 'the move from non-contact offences to a contact offence is significant' and he was made the subject of a hospital order. Detective Chief Inspector Tim Rowlandson said: 'We are extremely keen to hear from anyone who has seen this man since yesterday evening or knows where he might be. 'Mr Munden is subject to a hospital order after being convicted and sentenced for sexual offences and also suffers from learning difficulties, so we need to know where he is as a matter of urgency.'","Stephen Munden, 54, has absconded from hospital, near Hook, Hampshire .

"A  photographer captured an intimidating site as he parachuted off the coast of south Florida last week. Photographer John Massung was flying over Sebastian Inlet on Thursday when he saw hundreds of sharks swarming just 100 feet from the beach. Massung says he flew for about a mile down the shore and that the hordes of sharks never ended. A fellow photographer was even further out and saw the same scene. Worst nightmare: A swarm of sharks was spotted off the coast of south Florida last Thursday . Stay out of the water: When the following pictures were posted to Facebook, users theorized that the swarm was a mix of Blacktip and Spinner sharks . Swarm: Blacktip and Spinner sharks migrate each year to breed in shallower waters . 'It looked like they had traveling in mind. They were heading north,' Massung told NBC Miami. Since he wasn't certain what kind of shark was gathering south of the inlet, Massung posted the photos to the Indian River by Air Facebook page to see if any experts could offer some enlightenment. Most responded that the sharks looked like either Blacktips or Spinners, which migrate this time of year to breed. The picture had been shared more than 2,000 times by Sunday. Massung says the sharks were still out in the water on Friday, but the conditions weren't clear enough to photograph the scene.

"It may have been Miley Cyrus' pink heart-shaped nipple pasties that garnered all the attention when she paid honour to rocker Joan Jett on Saturday, but eagle-eyed fans were distracted by something else. Savvy social media users noticed that the 22-year-old, who attended the 30th Annual Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame Induction Ceremony on Saturday in Cleveland, Ohio, had given her razor a night off. Miley, 22, who is known and loved for her controversial sartorial choices, displayed a somewhat bushy underarm region as she posed for a social media snap. Scroll down for video . Miley Cyrus posed for a social media snap ahead of the 30th Annual Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame Induction Ceremony on Saturday in Cleveland, Ohio... and it appears that she had given her razor a night off .

Some users leapt to her defence, with El adding: 'Why do people even care that Miley Cyrus has armpit hair? Like wow imagine that, a human with hair! How gross!' A lot of users didn't understand why people were 'freaking out' over the singer's armpit hair, with Charlie saying: 'Miley Cyrus' armpit hair isn't ""hideous"", we all see men's armpit hair but that's apparently acceptable because they're men. Please shut up' Of course, loyal fans sprung to her defence. One, named Abi, tweeted: 'Stop telling @MileyCyrus to shave her armpits? She's a woman. She doesn't have to do what you say! There is nothing wrong with body hair.' Stephanie added: 'People are losing their minds over Miley Cyrus not shaving her armpits.. how can hair offend you? It's hair...'

"Tens of millions of people in China marked the annual 'Tomb Sweeping Festival' this weekend by travelling home to their ancestral villages. Families across the country descended on graveyards to clean their tombs of the deceased and honour their loved ones, burning fake paper money and leaving their favourite food and drink to ensure they are not poor or hungry in the afterlife. As part of the Qingming Festival – which means 'pure brightness' – China celebrates the coming spring and the beauty of nature, says People’s Daily Online. A grand and colourful ceremony was held in honour of the 'Yellow Emperor' Huangdi in Huangling County, Shaanxi Province . Huangdi is considered the ancestor of the Qingming Festival which sees the Chinese mark the start of spring with outdoor celebrations . Lines of dancers take to the stage as part of the celebration, which was watched by thousands of people during the public holiday . Around 1.3 billion Chinese people marked the Qingming Festival, a three-day holiday in China, by watching parades and travelling home . Traditional Chinese dancers wear intricate gowns as they swirl and dance in the sunshine during the celebrations in the city of Huangi . An actor dressed as a soldier takes a break from the celebration to check his phone . In Shaanxi Province, a huge outdoor celebration was held as part of the Qingming Festival and in honour of the 'Yellow Emperor' Huang Di, considered the founding father of the Chinese nation. A bell was rung from the top of the city's temple, while the drums were struck 34 times, one for each of China's provinces including Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. The festival falls in the first week of April every year, and is one of the 24 Chinese solar terms - the date from which temperatures rise, rainfall increases and marks an important time for the land to be prepared for the sowing of seeds. Hundreds of visitors filmed the celebrations on their smart phones, as a colourful inflatable dragon dances in the sky. It is said that the Yellow Emperor Huang Di did not die, but instead ascended into heaven on the back of a dragon - making the creature a Chinese symbol . Participants carry platters of fruit as part of the ceremony in the central China, which had hundreds of dancers and performers .

A young performer casts a smile on a guard, as she fixed her hair during the Qingming festival celebrations . Dancers make offerings to the water in a service at the Duijang Dam for Qingming - praying for favourable weather for their crops . Opinion on the origins of the festival differ, but it can be traced back to the Tang Dynasty which ruled China between 618 and 907. While millions of Chinese people made the trip to their ancestral villages, opportunistic traders took advantage of some people's inability to make the visit - advertising 'tomb sweeping packages' which include weeping, praying and cleaning. Depending on the package, costing between 100 yuan and 1,300 yuan, the buyer receives a commemorative photo of the occasion. A record-breaking 36.5 million passenger trips were made over the weekend and public holiday - up 5.8 per cent on last year and an all-time high. The rise is partially due to the construction of new railways in recent years, particularly high-speed railway, say commentators. A couple pray as they burn paper money during Qingming.

"A Church of Scientology-backed organization is facing a bizarre land use battle over its plans to turn a patch of secluded in woods near the presidential retreat Camp David into a drug rehab center. Lawyers hired by drug rehab network Narcocon have argued that Trout Run, a property in Frederick County, Maryland, has historic significance because President Herbert Hoover once caught a fish at the site. Opponents view the proposed designation as a trick to circumvent current zoning laws for the 40-acre plot of land and create a drug rehabilitation program that some call dangerous. Narcocon, a Church of Scientology-affiliated drug rehab network, is trying to prove that a patch of land near Camp David is historic enough so that they can build a center for twelve patients . A Scientology-back real estate company bought Trout Run for $4.85million in 2013, and has been trying to change its land designation so that it can build a center that uses saunas and vitamin therapy for addicts . Narcocon, which uses sauna sessions and the teachings of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard, has been sued in the past for wrongful deaths. It has denied wrongdoing. The group's treatment program claims that megadoses of the vitamin Niacin and spending five hours a day in a sauna for a month eliminates addiction cravings that are stored in the body's fat cells. Treatments at the center can cost more than $30,000 per month and typically last for as long as six months. Narcocon officials, who run more than 120 centers around the world, deny that the program tries to convert addicts to Scientology, though the group prominently features a quote from Hubbard on its website. The organization says that is focused on a secular approach to helping people overcome addiction. Its Maryland center would house 12 patients, with eight staff living there and eight living off-site. However, the current zoning laws for Trout Run, which includes a collection of stone cottages, classify it for resource conservation and do not permit any medical purpose for the site, according to the Washington Post. Though Narcocon says that it is non-religious and does not try to convert people to Scientology, its website features the religion's founder L Ron Hubbard (pictured) prominently . Placing the property on the county register of historic places would allow Narconon to conduct its program. The rehabilitation program was founded in 1966 and is based on the teachings of Scientology's founder L. Ron Hubbard. Narconon claims it is a non-religious, non-profit, non-medical . rehabilitation program with patients around the world. Its methods include . spending up to five hours a day in a sauna for 30 days straight and mega . doses of the vitamin Niacin. The hypothesis underlying the program is . that drugs and their metabolites are stored in the body's fatty tissues . for years, causing the addict's cravings when partially released later . on. But these can be flushed out through a regimen comprising elements such as . exercise, sauna and intake of high doses of vitamins, according to the facility's methods. This hypothesis does not enjoy . mainstream acceptance, and researchers and practitioners tend . to discount Narconon due to its connection with Scientology. No independent study that has not been funded by the center exist to confirm the supposed efficacy of its treatment, which has repeatedly been cited as curing 75 per cent of addicts. Since its establishment, it has faced considerable controversy over the . safety and effectiveness of its rehabilitation methods and the . organization's links to the Church of Scientology. Fees can sometimes reach more than $30,000 per month and centers bring in millions of dollars a year from patients. An aide of Herbert Hoover bought the property in the late 1920s and the president went on fishing trips there,  the Frederick News Post reported. Narcocon hired a consultant whose history of Trout Run said that Hoover 'reeled in a fine one-and-one-half pound trout' during a visit. 'No President was born or died there. No epic battles were won or lost, no proclamations penned, no foreign dignitaries lodged and feted,' local drug counselor Kristin Milne-Glasser wrote in opposition to the historic designation. She said that the area merits a roadside plaque at most. President Dwight Eisenhower and other Washington elites also fished at Trout Run during his time in office. Frederick County's Historic Preservation Commission ruled that the site is eligible to be voted onto the register because of its early 20th century architecture. Social Betterment Properties International, a real estate company tied to Scientology, bought the land in 2013 for $4.85million from a government official who had long been trying to sell it. Narconon has been working on building its center since. County councilors delayed voting on the measure two weeks ago so they could have more time to review the proposal and plan to grant or deny approval on Tuesday. Beyond questions of history, opponents to the rehab center have cited safety concerns about the mysterious organization being so close to Camp David and Narcocon's alleged checkered past. Celebrity Scientologists such as John Travolta and Tom Cruise have repeated Narconon's message about how it saves 75 per cent of addicts. Trout Run was first built and developed by an aide of President Herbert Hoover (right) in the late 1920s. It is located in a woods several miles from presidential retreat Camp David (left during G8 Summit in 2012) Trout Run in Maryland was used for fishing by President Hoover (right) and President Dwight Eisenhower (left) during their times in office (file photo, Colorado, 1954) However, the organization previously lost its license  in Georgia after the death of  28-year-old former Marine Patrick Desmond, who was being treated for alcoholism but died after allegedly trying heroin for the first time while in treatment. Previous deaths at Narcocon include three young people who  died within a year at a flagship Oklahoma facility, according to NBC. Hilary Holten, 21, was found dead in her bed at the center in April 2012 of unknown causes. Stacy Murphy, 20, died of an oxymorphone overdose in July. Gabriel Graves, a 32-year-old father of two, died of unknown causes in October 2011. Narconon denied responsibility for any patient deaths. The group's Arrowhead in Oklahoma was estimated to have brought in $10.88million in revenue in 2011. The group has already approached the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene about acquiring a license for its facility but has not filed an application. Its website says it currently runs 16 centers in the United States, though the only one on the East Coast is in Massachusetts. Narcocon and its rehab network have attracted criticism from residents in western Maryland for its checkered past, though celebrities such as Tom Cruise (pictured, 2004) endorse it .

"Such has been the volatility at the top of the Championship this season that predicting future outcomes has proved a futile exercise, but what is certain is that Middlesbrough hold the aces. With just four weeks remaining, Aitor Karanka's team are top of a division that has witnessed the leadership change hands 15 times. Seven points separate eight teams with six matches to play but Boro know if they keep winning, they cannot be caught. Their buffer over second-placed Bournemouth is a point with Watford, their opponents on Monday, and Norwich a point further back. Patrick Bamford (left) of Middlesbrough celebrates his goal against Wigan with his team mates . Another advantage for the Teesside club is that their contest at Vicarage Road is a lunchtime kick-off. As they discovered on Good Friday, when they triumphed over relegation-threatened Wigan, stealing a march can have a psychological effect. Previous leaders Bournemouth and 10-man Watford could only draw, at Ipswich and Derby respectively, in the evening matches. 'It definitely puts pressure on other teams, like Watford and Bournemouth found on Friday night,' said Boro defender Ben Gibson. 'It gives us a few more hours to recover when the turnaround for games is short and sharp, as well. Monday will be the same, big style.' Watford's 18-goal striker Odion Ighalo intends to have a say in what happens next. Ighalo helped Granada reach La Liga in 2011 and admits he only signed for Watford to play in the English top flight. Odion Ighalo rescued a point for Watford with this equaliser against fellow promotion hopefuls Derby . Bournemouth have been this season's surprise package and led the Championship for 101 days . 'I came to Watford not because I want to play in the Championship but because I have the opportunity to be in the Premier League,' he said. 'Our fans have to scream from the start to the end. I know by God's grace we are going to win that game at home.' Such is the precarious nature of the promotion race, however, that the division could have a completely different top two on Monday evening if Watford and Norwich, who host mid-table Sheffield Wednesday, win and Bournemouth fail to secure three points against Birmingham. With the stakes so high it is perhaps understandable that Karanka is hoping Jonathan Woodgate, his experienced captain, can continue to play through the pain. He missed the recent defeat at Bournemouth due to his broken toe but returned against Wigan. Crucially, each of the defender's five appearances this season, and eight of his last nine, have resulted in wins. Alex Neil (left) has impressed since taking over at Norwich and the Canaries remain in contention at the top . Derby led the way earlier in the season but have now not won in seven games under Steve McClaren . Derby, meanwhile, have seemingly forgotten how to win. Seven games without victory has seen them slump to sixth but Steve McClaren insists he will not sacrifice his principles. McClaren, who takes his team to Wigan, said: 'I don't want to put 10 defenders on and kick the ball long and not play our football. We have a certain way of playing, a certain style, which has got us where we are.' The eighth side in the division are Wolves, who have the most potent striker in 28-goal Benik Afobe, signed from Arsenal for £2million in January. Afobe has made himself instantly at home and has Leeds in his sights today. Final word to the English forward: 'Every time we go into the changing room we see everyone else has won.'

"Documented and undocumented immigrant population in the United States could reach a record high of 51million in just eight years, according to U.S. Census figures. And by 2060, immigrants could account for 82 per cent of all population growth in the country. One in seven U.S. residents will be an immigrant by 2023, the report from the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) said. Documented and undocumented immigrants in the United States could reach a record high in the United States by 2023, when their share of the population could hit 14.8 per cent . That number could rise to one in five by 2060, when immigrant population reaches 78 million. This report comes as President Barack Obama is trying to use executive powers to expand Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) policies. Net immigration will steadily increase over the next 45 years, totaling at 64million . Without no change in current immigration policy, by 2023 the total immigrant population in the United states will reach 14.8 per cent, the highest ever recorded in American history . Immigration population will grow almost four times faster than native-born population and will reach 15.8 per cent of the nation's population by 2030, 17.1 per cent by 2040 and 18.8 per cent by 2060 . In 1990, immigrants accounted for just 7.9 per cent of U.S. population . U.S population could grow to 417million by 2016. In 2010 the population was 306million . Without a change to immigration policty, immigrants who arrive in the future and their descendants could account for three quarters of future U.S. population . Center for Immigration Studies . This could potentially exempt about five million undocumented immigrants from deportation. And with the surge in immigrant population, Republican presidential candidates have to figure out what their stance is on the subject as potential new policies could be established. CIS director of research Steven Camarota said that the growth in immigrant population has 'important implications for workers, schools, infrastructure, congestion and the environment'. 'They also may have implications for our ability to successfully assimilate and integrate immigrants,' he added. 'Yet there has been almost no national debate about bringing in so many people legally each year, which is the primary factor driving these numbers.' Currently there are approximately 12million undocumented immigrants in the United States and 70,000 more are expected to cross the border this year, according to the Washington Examiner. There are also more than 4.4million people on a U.S. State Department green card waiting list. And within years, Immigration population will grow almost four times faster than native-born population. From a starting point of 2010, immigration population will reach 15.8 per cent (57million) of the nation's population by 2030, 17.1 (65million) per cent by 2040 and 18.8 per cent (78million)  by 2060. Immigrants and their descendants will account for 75.5 per cent of the nation's population growth between 2010 and 2050 and 82 per cent of growth between 2010 and 2060. By 2060, immigrants and their descendants will account for 82 per cent of the nation's population growth since 2010 . President Barack Obama is trying to use executive powers to expand immigration policies, which could potentially exempt about 5million undocumented immigrants from deportation . Alabama Rep. Sen. Jeff Sessions, who has been a leader in the immigration debate, said in a letter to the New York Times on Saturday that an increase of immigrants in the country will hurt the middle class. He wrote: 'It defies reason to argue that the record admission of new foreign workers has no negative effect on the wages of American workers, including the wages of past immigrants hoping to climb into the middle class. 'Why would many of the largest business groups in the United States spend millions lobbying for the admission of more foreign workers if such policies did not cut labor costs?' Key business leaders form a group association with former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and members of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are meeting on Friday to discuss expanding immigration. The meeting it titled 'Understanding and Improving the High-Skilled H-1B Visa Program', according to the examiner. Republican leaders, particularly those running in the presidential race for 2016, have to figure out what their stance is on the subject as potential new policies could be established .","Documented and undocumented immigrant population in the United States could reach a record high of 51million in just eight years .

"Despite the hype surrounding its first watch, the iPhone is still the engine behind Apple's phenomenal success, its latest figures have revealed. The results far surpassed most analysts' expectations for the first three months of the year, when sales traditionally fall from their holiday-season peak. Apple sold more than 61 million iPhones in the quarter, accounting for more than two-thirds of its $58 billion in revenue for the quarter and the lion's share of its $13.6 billion in profit - and up 40% from a year ago . Sales of iPhones in China were also revealed to have outstripped those in the US. Apple sold more than 61 million iPhones in the quarter, accounting for more than two-thirds of its $58 billion in revenue for the quarter and the lion's share of its $13.6 billion in profit. $58 billion in revenue, $13.6 billion in profit . $200 billion in cash, up from around $150 billion a year ago. More than 61 million iPhones sole . iPad revenue fell 29% to $5.4 billion . Revenue from Mac computers rose 2%from a year earlier, to $5.6 billion . 'We are thrilled by the continued strength of iPhone, Mac and the App Store, which drove our best March quarter results ever,' said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO. 'We're seeing a higher rate of people switching to iPhone than we've experienced in previous cycles, and we're off to an exciting start to the June quarter with the launch of Apple Watch.' As expected, the numbers were down from the previous quarter, when holiday shoppers snapped up a record 74 million of Apple's new iPhone 6, 6 Plus and older models. But it was a 40 percent increase over the number of iPhones sold in the first three months of 2014. 'We're seeing great results all over the world,' Apple chief financial officer Luca Maestri told The Associated Press, adding that iPhone sales grew 72 percent in China, where the company has big hopes for expansion. Other products played a much smaller role. Revenue from Mac computers rose 2 percent from a year earlier, to $5.6 billion, while iPad revenue fell 29 percent, to $5.4 billion — continuing a steady decline in tablet sales. Apple didn't report any results for the new Apple Watch, which it began selling this month, after the quarter ended. Maestri said customer response had been 'positive.' Analysts estimate about 2 million have sold to date, suggesting early demand is healthy but not of blockbuster proportions. Apple shares have gained more than 50 percent over the last year, making it the world's most valuable company. 'It's been really great to see the reaction of customers,' said Cook. 'The response has been overwhelming. We can't wait to see more of the inspiring apps developers dream up.' The iPhone is another story. Since it began offering models with bigger screens last fall, Apple has vied with South Korea's Samsung for the No. 1 position in the global smartphone market. By some estimates, Apple outsold Samsung in the quarter that ended in December, and analysts will be watching closely when Samsung reports its latest results this week. Apple also announced an expansion of its effort to return more of its sizable cash war chest to investors. The company said it will raise its quarterly dividend by 11 percent, to 52 cents a share, and has increased a $90 billion stock buyback program to $140 billion. Apple didn't report any results for the new Apple Watch, which it began selling this month, after the quarter ended. In total, the company said the program will return $200 billion to investors by the end of March 2017. As iPhone sales have surged, so has Apple's stock. Apple shares have gained more than 50 percent over the last year, making it the world's most valuable company. The stock closed Monday at $132.65, up 1.8 percent for the day, and was rising in late trading. The iPhone isn't just Apple's 'dominant product,' said Frank Gillett, a tech industry analyst at Forrester Research. 'It's more than anything else what's driving the success of their company.' Market researchers, however, expect growth in the world smartphone market will slow this year, particularly at the higher price range where Apple competes, as most consumers in developed countries have already bought one. That could make it difficult for Apple to maintain its recent pace. 'They're extremely dependent on the iPhone,' said investment Colin Gillis at BGC Partners. 'At some point, the market dynamics change,' he said, adding that 'the question is what could replace the iPhone' if sales begin to slow. Customers looking at Apple iPhones in an Apple store in Shanghai, China, on January 14, 2014. Apple CEO Tim Cook has said he's optimistic about new markets such as China, where Apple has made a strong showing against Samsung and China's Xiaomi. And even if Apple is increasingly selling new iPhones to people who are simply upgrading older models, 'that's still a pretty healthy market,' said Gartner analyst Van Baker, noting that more than 700 million iPhones have been sold since the first model was introduced in 2007. Maestri also stressed the potential for new products like Apple Watch and Apple Pay, the company's mobile payment service. While these currently provide minimal revenue, analysts say they have big potential. And they are designed to work closely with the iPhone, which means each may bolster the other's popularity in the future, Gillett said.","Apple sold more than 61 million iPhones in the quarter .

"Just like humans learning to talk, puppies can sometimes take a while to learn to bark. At least, that seemed to be the case for one young Shibu Inu, who caused hilarity with a somewhat chatty display at an American Kennel Club centre. The pup was filmed squeaking and squawking after meeting a young husky dog and attempting to bark at its new companion. Captured on video, the puppies are held in the air by their respective handlers and one of the dogs makes a high-pitched whining sound. Opening its mouth, the Shibu Inu then begins vocalising with a yappy bark before the husky – leaning back in its handler’s arm – whines. People standing by laugh and put their hands to their mouths as a staff member turns to address and pacify the dog. The puppy Shibu Inu and husky feature opposite one another while conversing at an American Kennel Club centre . Falling quiet for a second, the Shibu Inu pipes up once more – louder than before – causing the husky to respond. As the dogs continue to converse, the video maker asks with a giggle: ‘What is that noise?’ But it is barely audible over the sounds of the intense barking, whining and yapping. Later in the video the excited Shibu Inu begins running in its owner's arms in its attempts to get closer to the husky. Passers-by laugh and film the two dogs as they begin yapping, whining and barking at one another . And people in the video can be seen laughing while mimicking the dog’s erratic and entirely humorous actions. The video concludes with the husky losing interest slightly and chewing on its handler’s sleeve. Before the same handler speaks to the Shibu Inu and gives it a rub, causing it to momentarily settle down. A staff member from the American Kennel Club centre attempts to pacify the puppy by giving it a rub . Canine vocalisation usually begins when a puppy is around two-to-three-weeks-old and generally consists of grunts and whines. At seven-to-eight-weeks-old, the vocalisation will develop into stronger sounding barks, although some dogs wait as long as 16 weeks before even making an attempt.","The Shibu Inu puppy has the impromptu chat with a husky .

"Nicola Sturgeon will today launch an extraordinary bid to ‘lead the UK’ as she unveils a string of policies apparently tailor-made for a power-sharing deal with Labour. The SNP leader will unveil a manifesto including proposals for British foreign policy, welfare payments, energy bills and English university tuition fees. Several of her election pledges overlap with Labour policy, including slashing tuition fees in England from a maximum of £9,000 a year to £6,000, and rolling back competition in the English NHS. Others are calculated to drag a minority Labour government to the left, including halting the roll-out of Iain Duncan Smith’s popular changes to benefits and cancelling the Trident nuclear weapons system. Scroll down for video . Control: The Tories warn SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon will be Ed Miliband's puppet master if he becomes Prime Minister after the election . Several election pledges in Miss Sturgeon's manifesto overlap with Labour policy, including slashing tuition fees in England from a maximum of £9,000 a year to £6,000, and rolling back competition in the English NHS . The SNP also wants the UK to formally recognise Palestine as a state, give energy regulator Ofgem the power to force suppliers to cut prices and to increase public spending on infrastructure in northern England and Wales. At the heart of the SNP’s manifesto are plans for what Miss Sturgeon has called ‘modest’ spending increases funded by yet more borrowing – but which in fact total £180billion over five years. Scotland’s First Minister, who is not herself running for a Westminster seat, said yesterday the SNP had much in common with Left-wing Labour MPs and aimed to build a ‘progressive alliance’ for people ‘right across the UK’. ‘There is an opportunity to build progressive alliances for progressive policies. It is a real rather than a pretend alternative to austerity,’ she told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. Today’s SNP election manifesto will be the first to be the focus of intense national scrutiny. Polls suggest the party is on course for a landslide victory north of the border, winning as many as 50 seats and holding the balance of power at Westminster. That could trigger constitutional turmoil of the sort that followed the 1910 election, when Irish Nationalists surged and ended up with more than 70 seats. In the years that followed, there was bitter conflict and the larger part of Ireland eventually seceded from the UK. The huge surge in support for the SNP could see senior Labour figures such as Jim Murphy (left) and Douglas Alexander (right) lose their seats . The latest Scotland-wide YouGov survey shows the SNP on a record 49 per cent, up three, with Labour trailing on 25 per cent, down four. The Conservatives were on 18 per cent and Liberal Democrats on just four per cent. The scale of the shift in traditional Labour strongholds in Scotland is unprecedented in modern European politics. Even senior Labour figures, including the Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy and the shadow foreign secretary and the party’s election campaign coordinator, Douglas Alexander, are facing defeat. The SNP will declare today that a ‘strong team’ of SNP MPs in Westminster would help ‘rebalance the UK - both politically and economically - from the chronic over-dominance of the City of London, which has harmed the overall UK economy and left regions of England neglected’. Miss Sturgeon insisted those who had asked Scotland to remain in the UK in last year’s independence referendum could not now object to it calling the shots at Westminster. ‘We were told by leaders of the No campaign during the closing stages of the referendum debate that Scotland’s voice really mattered. Indeed, we were told that Scotland shouldn’t leave the UK but lead the UK,’ she said. ‘So it is more than a bit rich, now that Scotland has decided to remain part of the Westminster system, for anyone in London or elsewhere to try and imply that Scotland’s voice shouldn’t be heard or that Scotland’s voice somehow becomes an illegitimate one if people here decide to elect a large number of SNP MPs.’ However, the First Minister will face tough questions at today’s launch over her plans for ‘full fiscal autonomy’ or effective ‘home rule’, which would see almost every power apart from foreign affairs and defence devolved to Holyrood. It would end the generous Barnett Formula that funds Scotland. The Institute for Fiscal Studies  has predicted that a ‘fiscally autonomous’ Scotland would have a £7.6billion black hole in its finances.","Nicola Sturgeon will today unveil SNP manifesto as a 'bid to lead the UK'

"Muslim women should be allowed to wear a full-face veil while appearing in court, Britain's most senior judge has suggested. Lord Neuberger, the President of the Supreme Court, said judges and courtrooms should allow women to wear the traditional dress as they should 'show, and be seen to show' respect towards different customs. He said judges should be 'sensitive' to the fact that they usually came from 'more privileged sector of society' than many of those facing them and they should have an understanding of the 'different cultural and social habits'. Lord Neuberger said Britain's privileged judges must be aware of their 'subconscious bias' when dealing with poorer members of society . His address to the Criminal Justice Alliance came at a time of uncertainty over the place of Muslim traditional dress in the legal system. Following a controversial trial in 2003 of a Muslim woman accused of witness intimidation, Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas said there was a need for clear guidance on the issue. Rebekah Dawson refused to give evidence after being told she had to remove her face veil to let the jury see her face while testifying. The 22-year-old was later sentenced to six months in prison at Blackfriars Crown Court after changing her plea. Rebekah Dawson refused to give evidence after being told she had to remove her face veil to let the jury see her face while testifying. Here she pictured during her court hearing . Last year, the European Court of Human Rights upheld a ban by France on wearing the Muslim full-face veil, the niqab. A case was brought by a 24-year-old French woman, who argued that the ban on wearing the veil in public violated her freedom of religion and expression. In Lord Neuberger's address, he said judges and lawyers often failed to recognise how 'artificial and intimidating' courts could be for ordinary people. He said: 'I sometimes wonder whether our trial procedures really are the best way of getting at the truth. 'Would you feel that you had given of your best if you had been forced to give evidence in unfamiliar surroundings, with lots of strangers watching, in an intimidating court, with lawyers in funny clothes asking questions, often aggressively and trying to catch you out, and with no ability to tell the story as you remember it?' Dawson was later sentenced to six months in prison at Blackfriars Crown Court (pictured) He said this did not mean a call for a major overhaul of court proceedings but said judges, lawyers and court staff must do as much as possible to help people feel at ease in court. He continued: 'Judges have to show, and have to be seen to show, respect to everybody equally, and that requires an understanding of different cultural and social habits. 'It is necessary to have some understanding as to how people from different cultural, social, religious or other backgrounds think and behave and how they expect others to behave. 'Well known examples include how some religions consider it inappropriate to take the oath, how some people consider it rude to look other people in the eye, how some women find it inappropriate to appear in public with their face uncovered, and how some people deem it inappropriate to confront others or to be confronted – for instance with an outright denial. Lord Neuberger also suggested Muslim women should be allowed to wear a full face veil while appearing in court . 'More broadly, judges should be courteous and, generally, good-humoured; and, while they should be firm, they should never, however great the temptation, lose their temper.' The judge made the comments a week ago during an address to the Criminal Justice Alliance, in which he spoke of modern aspects of the British legal system. In a lengthy speech entitled 'Fairness in the courts: the best we can do', Lord Neuberger also said judges and lawyers should always keep in mind how 'intimidating' the court process can be for those involved in trials, including 'the parties, their families, the victims, the witnesses and the jurors'. Speaking in the context of legal aid cuts, he said the importance of ensuring all parties involved in a case understand the goings-on in a court is now greater because 'people are having to choose between representing themselves or not getting justice at all'. He also said: 'Judges may not appear to be neutral because they will almost always be seen, normally rightly, to come from a more privileged sector of society, in both economic and educational terms, compared with many of the parties, witnesses, jurors in court. 'A white male public school judge presiding in a trial of an unemployed traveller from Eastern Europe accused of assaulting or robbing a white female public school woman will, I hope, always be unbiased. 'However, he should always think to himself what his subconscious may be thinking or how it may be causing him to act.' Keith Porteous Wood, Executive Director of the National Secular Society, told the Daily Telegraph: 'Lord Neuberger understandably recommends judges understand the expectations of how those 'from different cultural, social, religious or other backgrounds think and behave and how they expect others to behave' and that the judiciary should show 'respect to everybody equally'. 'It was a missed opportunity, however, not to acknowledge that occasionally – for example on a defendant wearing a full face veil – doing so might conflict with justice being seen to be done, or even justice being done. 'My concern is not theoretical; it is now 18 months since a judge at Blackfriars Magistrate Court wasted a great deal of court time dealing with the question of full-face veils, and made a heartfelt plea for central guidance to avoid this inefficient use of expensive court's resources being replicated elsewhere. 'The Lord Chief Justice's office has been dealing with this for a long time but seems disappointingly reluctant to issue any direction.'","Lord Neuberger said Muslim women should be allowed to wear a full-face veil when appearing in court to show respect to 'different customs .

Buckingham Palace confirmed His Royal Highness Prince Edward's injury and said: 'The Duke of Kent was admitted on Monday to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, where he was successfully treated for a dislocated hip. 'The Duke is expected to leave hospital later today.' The dislocation comes just two years after the Duke suffered a 'mild' stroke. In March 2013, he was taken to University College Hospital in London after suffering a the stroke, also known as a transient ischaemic attack. Despite his age, the Duke still undertakes a large number of royal engagements. He became the Duke of Kent at just six when his father died in a wartime flying accident in 1942. The Duke is the son of Prince George, the younger brother of King George VI and King Edward VIII. He enjoyed a lengthy military career and was a respected Army officer who also acted as Britain's international trade ambassador for 25 years.

"These extraordinary pictures show more than 1,700 Chinese students taking an exam in their high school's playground - because they could not all fit inside. The freshmen students from Yichuan, Shaanxi province took the exam on Saturday in the first attempt by the school to allow pupils to sit exams in the open. The school said the reason behind the unusual move was the lack of sufficient indoor space - and added that it could be a test of the students' organizing capacity, the People's Daily Online reported. The paper reported that the Grade One students at Yichuan Senior High School suggested and organised the outdoor exam themselves. The students thought of everything and in order to avoid being dazzled by the sunshine, which may have caused them to feel dizzy, a regular radio announcement ordered pupils to turn their chairs and desks collectively from time to time. The newspaper reported that many of the students believe sitting the exam outside is a novel way to broaden their horizons and encourage them to feel more relaxed. Some of the students also suggested it could help to prevent cheating. 'Grade One students suggested they organise the exam in such a way,' said one unnamed teacher.

"Ed Miliband will do 'more damage to the country than he did to his brother', Boris Johnson said this morning as the pair clashed on live TV. The London Mayor, who appeared alongside Mr Miliband on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, launched a furious personal assault on his rival - with their encounter descending into a furious shouting match. But Mr Miliband, who beat his elder brother David to the Labour leadership in 2010, ended up laughing off the attack, responding: 'Come on Boris, you're better than that.' Animated: Boris Johnson wags a finger at Miliband, who appears to have a clenched fist, on the Andrew Marr Show this morning. The rivals' encounter quickly descended into a slanging match . No let-up: The Tory and Labour politicians go at it hammer and tongs in front of their TV audience . The heated exchange ends with presenter Andrew Marr (right) injecting and the men trying to laugh about it . Mr Johnson's verbal mauling of the Labour leader comes after the Tories were accused of 'descending into the gutter' for claiming that Mr Miliband may 'stab the country in the back' by doing a deal with the SNP to get into power. But today, Mr Johnson insisted that Labour could not take power without the support of the SNP, and claimed the prospect was 'actually deeply alarming'. He said Mr Miliband would have to take help from the Scottish party 'crouching on his back like a monkey' - making it impossible for him to govern in the interests of the whole UK. The London Mayor added: I am not saying that your brother had to present himself at A&E with a dagger in his back... [but] he [Ed Miliband] would do more damage to this country than he did to his brother, and that is the key point.' Verbal onslaught: Mr Johnson said that Labour could not take power without the support of the SNP . Time to go: Mr Johnson and Mr Miliband leave the politics programme after their massive on-air argument . Mr Miliband arrived at the BBC studios in Central London by car, while Mr Johnson cycled there . Ed Miliband won the Labour leadership in September 2010 by narrowly beating his brother David, who had been the runaway favourite for the top job. The younger sibling won the ballot by just over 1 per cent after the second, third and fourth preference votes came into play. David had garnered the majority of support from Labour MPs and party members - but Ed was ahead with the trade-union members. He hugged David after the result was announced - but later admitted the decision to stand against him caused deep division between the brothers. David stayed on as an MP until 2013, then announced he was quitting Parliament to become head of the giant New York-based charity International Rescue Committee. Mr Miliband hit out at the Conservatives for their campaign, saying: 'They are so desperate they are reduced to trying to set one part of the country against another.' Mr Johnson insisted the Conservative attacks on the SNP were not risking the union. 'I'm so proud and so positive about what's happening in this country at the moment, and I just think there are unnecessary risks involved in this Labour-SNP condominium,' he said. 'So the answer would be, no I don't think we are in any way imperiling the union. The people who would imperil the union, because that's what their party is called, is the Scottish Nationalist Party. 'And I imagine their strategy - like the parable, or the fable, of the frog and the scorpion - is to be allowed to be carried across the river and then ultimately to sting... [he is cut off]' The Conservatives have made the prospect of a Labour administration that's reliant on SNP votes one of the central planks of their election campaign in the last fortnight. But Mr Miliband has repeatedly insisted that he will not make any 'deals' with the SNP to become Prime Minister. And he told Andrew Marr today: 'No coalition, no tie-ins, I have said no deals - I have been clear about that. I am not doing deals with the Scottish Nationalist Party.' Asked explicitly whether he was ruling out a confidence-and-supply agreement, he replied: 'No deals.' Ed Miliband and Boris Johnson livened up the election campaign this morning when they went head-to-head on live TV. After being interviewed separately by presenter Andrew Marr, the pair of would-be Prime Ministers were brought together to challenge each other directly. Mr Miliband kicked off the heated exchange by demanding to know if Mr Johnson backed rules that allow wealthy foreigners living in Britain to avoid tax on their overseas earnings. He said: ‘Are you for keeping non-dom status? You’re defending those people who come here, they live here for 30 years, they are permanently here and they don’t pay taxes here.’ Mr Johnson responded: ‘Hang on, is this the Ed Miliband who was in the Treasury with Gordon Brown for about ten years? Are you the same creature? I mean, is there some sort of doppelganger going on?’ The Labour leader hit back, saying: ‘Don’t get rattled, come on now. Andrew Marr interjected to ask the London Mayor to defend inflammatory remarks in which he had accused Mr Miliband of being a back stabber. He said: ‘You attacked Ed Miliband very forcibly today, Boris, for backstabbing. Do you really think that is a fair approach to somebody who is standing in an election? Before Mr Johnson could speak, Mr Miliband said: ‘He doesn’t believe it. Come on, Boris, you are better than that.’ But the London Mayor replied: ‘I am not saying that your brother had to present himself at A&E with a dagger in his back. But he would do more damage to this country than to his brother - and that is the key point.’","London Mayor appeared with Mr Miliband on BBC1's Andrew Marr Show .

"Jeremy Clarkson has finally spoken out about his high-profile sacking from Top Gear, admitting he will 'miss' fronting the BBC2 show. Clarkson, 54, who was fired in March after attacking a producer during filming, has not publicly addressed his dismissal, apart from to say that 'everyone's upset'. But the presenter today gave his 'heartfelt thanks' to those who sent their support in the aftermath of his sacking, saying he would 'miss being there'. It came as Ms Rippon, 70, who first presented the show 38 years ago, said she would be keen to return to the motoring show if she were invited back. Scroll down for video . Jeremy Clarkson (left) today revealed he would 'miss' fronting Top Gear, as it emerged that former presenter Angela Rippon (right) would be keen to return to the motoring show . Ms Rippon, 70, who first presented the show 38 years ago, said it would be 'great' if she were invited back to front Top Gear . Writing in The Sun, Clarkson said: 'Heartfelt thanks to all those who have written to say how much they will miss me on Top Gear. It's not as much, however, as I'll miss being there.' Clarkson was dropped by the BBC after an internal investigation found he had launched an 'unprovoked' 30-second physical attack on producer Oisin Tymon because he was offered a plate of cold cuts instead of steak and chips. The presenter was found to have split the producer's lip and verbally abused him. Following weeks of speculation over the star's future, Lord Hall, the director-general of the corporation, publicly announced  that the BBC would not be renewing Clarkson's contract. He said Clarkson had 'crossed the line' and that 'there cannot be one rule for one and one rule for another'. Now, with the future of the show still up in the air, former newsreader Ms Rippon said it would be 'great' if she was invited back. Clarkson, who was dropped by the BBC after launching an 'unprovoked' 30-second physical attack on producer Oisin Tymon. today gave his 'heartfelt thanks' to those who have supported him . She told The Daily Mirror: 'It would be great if they said ""let's get the old girl back to do the odd film for us"". What I did all those years ago is totally different to what they do now. 'If a programme is going to have longevity, which Top Gear has, it has to keep evolving.' She added that there should be a woman included in the team - because half the drivers on the road are female. Jodie Kidd, the former model, has already been linked to the show. It also emerged last month that DIY SOS star Nick Knowles could become the new Top Gear presenter because the BBC believe he is a 'safe pair of hands'. Meanwhile, BBC bosses are said to be desperately trying to hold onto James May (left) and Richard Hammond (right) - Clarkson's co-presenters - for the BBC2 show . Mr May has previously said that the trio 'came as a package', while Hammond - not ruling out a return - said the sacking marked 'the end of an era' But BBC bosses are reportedly still trying to persuade Richard Hammond and James May to continue with the show, in a bid to cling onto long-term fans. Although May, 52, and Hammond, 45, have both hinted separately that they do not see a future with Top Gear, both have remained silent on the issue for the past few weeks. A source told the Daily Mirror: 'Richard is a TV presenter and this could be his chance to become top dog - he's been on the show a bit longer than James. That is a big opportunity to pass over.' They added: 'It would be a great shame to lose all the talent in one go - re-booting it from scratch would be a far harder task than replacing one.' Mr May has previously said that the trio 'came as a package', while Hammond - not ruling out a return - said the sacking marked 'the end of an era'. But little has been said since the initial reaction to the sacking. Some believe the presenters are remaining silent while waiting for bids from rival channels, which may want to sign up the group as a trio. All three were on the cusp of signing new three-year deals when the Clarkson fracas unfolded. Some believe the pair are remaining silent while waiting for bids from rival channels, which may want to snap up the former Top Gear group as a trio . The day after Clarkson's sacking, May gave a big hint that he has no plans to return to Top Gear, suggesting he is to ‘go back to normal life.’ The presenter admitted he was already considering what to do next with his life - and suggested he might even ditch cars to become a teacher. He said: 'I might want to do something completely different with my life, I'm quite old now. (I might do) something outside of cars, I always wanted to be a teacher.' He also seemed to confirm speculation that he would leave the top-rating programme, saying: 'We always knew it wasn't going to last forever'. Clarkson, 54, was sacked after attacking Oisin Tymon in an episode which Lord Hall said had 'crossed the line' But the BBC's creative director Alan Yentob previously made it clear he wanted May and Hammond to continue presenting the show without Clarkson, despite acknowledging it would be 'perfectly natural' for them to have reservations about continuing. He said: 'It's perfectly natural for them. They are a team they have worked together for a very long time, they are all very attached. 'If Jeremy is not in it and Richard and James are, that needs to be a conversation with them as well. They need to be happy about what's going on and where they think the programme needs to be.' May fronts several other TV programmes, including the popular James May's Toy Stories, James May's Man Lab and Oz and James' Big Wine Adventure with wine expert Oz Clarke. Hammond has a successful career as a children’s television host, fronting the second series of National Geographic's Science of Stupid. He also hosted BBC1’s physical game show Total Wipeout and the CBBC series Blast Lab before they were axed. Clarkson, May and Hammond are scheduled to take part in the live Top Gear shows next month. But the shows have been renamed, without BBC branding. Earlier this month North Yorkshire Police said that following an investigation Clarkson would face no further police action over his attack on the producer at a hotel. Clarkson pulled out of his planned appearance hosting BBC satirical show Have I Got News For You, which was due to be filmed next week, and aired a day later. It would have marked his first BBC appearance since the fracas which led to his departure.","Clarkson has not spoken publicly about sacking since news broke in March .

"(CNN)Giovanni Lo Porto put himself in harm's way to help, heading to Pakistan to work on a much needed reconstruction project following deadly flooding there. His work and his life, as he knew it then, came to a halt on January 19, 2012. That's when, according to Italy's state-run ANSA news agency, four armed men burst into the building where Lo Porto lived and abducted him along with colleague Bernd Muehlenbeck. Two years later, Lo Porto was dead -- killed accidentally by a U.S. drone strike, according to American authorities. The native of the Sicilian city of Palermo died along with a fellow al Qaeda hostage, American Warren Weinstein. That same counterterrorism operation in a border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan killed at least one al Qaeda leader, Ahmed Farouq, who was also a U.S. citizen. His family members, including his four brothers, called him Giancarlo. Lo Porto grew up in Sicily and then studied at London Metropolitan University, getting his undergraduate degree there in Peace and Conflict Studies in 2010, according to the school. A professor there remembers him as ""passionate, friendly (and) open-minded,"" according to an ANSA report. And the university, in a statement, described him as ""a popular student who was committed to helping others."" ""We are tremendously proud of him and the humanitarian work he did,"" the school said. At the time he was taken captive, Lo Porto worked with the German aid organization Welthungerlife, a 53-year-old group dedicated to fighting hunger and poverty worldwide. Such work means going to places where the need is most -- places like Multan in Pakistan. That community was one of many in Pakistan devastated by major flooding in 2010, which covered about one-fifth of the country and left more than 1,500 people dead. These conditions are all too common in the South Asian nation, as evidenced by flooding one year later that forced upwards of 660,000 into refugee camps and killed more than 430 people, about a quarter of whom were children. ""He told me, 'I'm pleased to have returned to Asia and Pakistan, I love the people, culture and food in this part of the world,' "" said the London Metropolitan University professor. Specifically, Lo Porto was a project manager with Welthungerlife's clean water and sanitation program, working with 8 to 10 fellow international staffers and 100 to 200 locals starting in October 2011, according to Simone Pott, a spokeswoman for the aid group. Pott described Lo Porto as a lively, very positive man who made friends all over the world. Some of those friends in Italy, England and beyond pressed for Lo Porto's release after he was taken captive, urging Italy's government and newspaper editors to get his story out, ANSA reported. The same story said that al Qaeda (after first claiming he was being held) denied abducting Lo Porto, as did the Pakistani Taliban. Muehlenbeck, a German national, was freed last October, at which time he said that he and his colleague had been separated, according to ANSA. But Lo Porto never got the chance to savor freedom again, like his German counterpart. Italian Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni said his country's government ""carried out every effort possible to trace and try to return Giovanni to his loved ones."" ""Unfortunately, the conclusion is now different (than we wanted) because of the tragic and fatal mistake of our American allies, which has been recognized by President Obama,"" Gentiloni said. ""The responsibility of his death and (that) of Warren Weinstein ... is that of the terrorists."" On Thursday, after the U.S. government reported Lo Porto's death, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi expressed his ""deepest sorrow for the death of an Italian who dedicated his life to the service of others."" Lo Porto's death left those at his former charity Welthungerlife speechless and confused, Pott said. And then there are his family members like his mother, who ANSA reports became ""another person"" after her son's kidnapping. ""Her only hope was to embrace Giovanni,"" a neighbor said. CNN's Hadia Messia contributed to this report.","NGO where Lo Porto works describes him as a lively, positive man with lots of friends .

"(CNN)He might have just won one of sport's most prestigious events, but it wasn't long before Jordan Spieth's thoughts turned to his autistic sister in the glow of victory. The 21-year-old golfer equaled Tiger Woods' 1997 record winning score of 18 under par to realize his childhood ambitions of donning the green jacket on Sunday as he swept through the field to become Masters champion at Augusta. An ice-cool display made him the second-youngest winner -- behind only Woods, who was 155 days younger that year -- and only the fifth man to have led from start to finish over the tournament's four days. ""I miss her a lot, and I wish she could have been here,"" Spieth told CNN's Don Riddell in the aftermath of his triumph as he opened up about younger sibling Ellie, who was not able to attend the tournament. ""But I can't wait to get back to her and maybe let her try on the jacket. ""I'll have to bring her back a present from here. That's what she'll be expecting."" Amid all the pressure of playing professional golf, Spieth's 14-year-old sister provides him with perspective. ""How has she shaped my upbringing? Well, she's the most special part of our family. She's the funniest part of our family,"" he said. ""I love having her around. She's an incredible sister, my biggest supporter. She is somebody who you can watch and then reflect on the big picture of life and understand that all these frustrations in a day, or in a round of golf, are really secondary. ""We wouldn't have that realization without her."" At the age of just 14, the prodigy from Texas -- who was named after basketball legend Michael Jordan -- had been clear about what he wanted: his aim was to take the Masters title one day. And he betrayed virtually no sign of nerves throughout his stunningly dominant performance, letting slip only a muttered ""oh dear"" when he marginally sliced a tee shot halfway through the final round. Last year, Spieth lost the lead just before the nine-hole turn on the last day -- but he never looked like being denied this time, beating Phil Mickelson's Masters record of 26 birdies for good measure. ""To sit with this jacket on and to be a part of the history of Augusta National and the Masters was something I watched slip away last year,"" said Spieth, who described the reality of winning as ""even better"" than his dreams. ""I had a chip on my shoulder (about that). I carried some momentum into this week and it all came together, right at the right time."" Shown a picture of himself wearing one of the most coveted pieces of clothing in sport, Spieth, born in Dallas, added: ""Putting on the jacket, it looks good. It looks good. I'm OK wearing green!"" He couldn't stop grinning as he said that he hoped to be finishing his final Masters appearance in 50 years' time, but added that he would ""still remember what it was like walking up the 18th hole today."" And as he looked less far ahead, he revealed that he would be staying true to his roots at next year's Champions Dinner. Asked what he would put on the menu for that event, he said: ""It would be some form of Texas BBQ."" The unassuming Spieth's success brings to mind other stars whose supreme ability and self-belief saw them become major champions in the early days of their careers. In 1985, German tennis player Boris Becker stunned Wimbledon when, at the age of 17, he defeated Kevin Curren to become the event's youngest ever men's champion -- a record that still stands today. Becker said people ""thought I had done something I wasn't supposed to do, something that shouldn't have been possible. But I did it -- and then I did it again at 18, just to make the point."" American player Michael Chang was 118 days younger than Becker when he won the French Open in 1989, while Swiss star Martina Hingis was just 16 when she triumphed at the 1997 Australian Open. Last year, at the age of only 15, Martin Odegaard became Norway's youngest international footballer when he played in a friendly against the United Arab Emirates, provoking huge media interest and the attention of Europe's top clubs, before he signed for Spanish giant Real Madrid. For them, as for Spieth, perhaps success was meant to be from the earliest days. And as he looked at a picture of himself with a golf club in hand, taken at the age of 6 or 7 at his grandparents' home in North Carolina, he reflected on the determination that had put him in the green jacket, referring to another Major winner. ""How about the focus on that swing?"" he asked. ""That's a little John Daly-like there, isn't it?""","Jordan Spieth hails autistic younger sibling as his biggest supporter .

"Arsene Wenger insists his woeful record against Jose Mourinho will have no bearing on Arsenal's top-of-the-table clash with Chelsea at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday. Wenger has failed to win in 12 games against Mourinho across the Portuguese coach's two spells at Stamford Bridge, drawing five and losing seven of their clashes. But the Arsenal manager says the past shared between the two managers on the touchline in Sunday's 4pm kick-off will be irrelevant as the Barclays Premier League's top two sides face off. Arsene Wenger has drawn five and lost seven of his 12 clashes with Jose Mourinho ahead of facing Chelsea . Wenger and Mourinho rowed on the touchline in October's 2-0 win for Chelsea in the reverse fixture . 'I think we have not always lost in 12 attempts. We have been close,' Wenger said. 'Having said that, the result on Sunday will just be down to the performance on the day. We are on a good run and we have an opportunity at home to beat them and we want to take it. 'We have a good run of form and good belief and solidarity. We have passed many tests recently when we were questioned. We have another test on Sunday that we want to pass. 'Chelsea's strengths are they have been very efficient on counter attacks and set-pieces as well. We have to nullify their strengths.' Asked about his frosty relationship with Mourinho, Wenger said: 'I do not want to talk about that. What is interesting for people is when the game starts at 4pm we have a great game. It is not about the relationship between the managers.' The managers of London's two biggest clubs have long had a frosty relationship in the opposing dugouts . Cesc Fabregas set up Diego Costa to seal a 2-0 victory for Chelsea against Arsenal earlier this season . Arsenal are 10 points behind Chelsea but come into the game on the back of excellent form. Wenger said: 'Look, mathematically it will be possible, yes, but Chelsea has their future and the championship in their hands. We can get closer and we have an opportunity to do that at home and want to take it.' Wenger added: 'They have been very consistent until now. They have fewer losses than any team. The Premier League rewards consistency. On that front they gave been defensively very strong and consistent.' Fabregas gets ahead of his now-team-mate Branislav Ivanovic to score against Chelsea for Arsenal in 2010 . Sunday's game marks the return of former Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas, who will be wearing Chelsea blue at the Emirates for the first time. Fabregas left for Barcelona in 2011. Arsenal supporters are expected to give their former hero a hot reception after he joined their fierce rivals, but Wenger has asked for some respect for one of their best players of the last decade. 'I want every player to be respected, and Cesc Fabregas when he comes to the Emirates on Sunday to be respected like he deserves,' he said. Asked if he regretted not signing Fabregas in the summer when he had the option to, Wenger added: 'The regret I have is that he wanted to leave here. 'This club and myself had a very positive influence on Cesc’s life, so I would be a bit uncomfortable to have to justify today why he is not here. I believe I would rather it was the other way around.' Wenger is without Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Mikel Arteta on Sunday, while Per Mertesacker is rated as '50-50' by his manager having not trained at all this week.

"Yaya Toure will not be forced out of Manchester City, but the club are set to make the midfielder available this summer. Sportsmail revealed earlier this week that the Barclays Premier League champions will listen to offers for the Ivorian as they look to reshape their squad after a disappointing season. But Toure will fight for his City career this summer despite the club pondering his future. Yaya Toure will not be forced out of Manchester City, but the club are set to make him available this summer . Sportsmail revealed earlier this week that the  Premier League champions will listen to offers for the Ivorian . He is said to be content with life at the Etihad Stadium despite the difficulties and is in no rush to leave. The Ivorian has played a major role during City's recent trophy-laden period, helping the club to two Premier League titles, an FA Cup and League Cup since joining from Barcelona in 2010. And the powerhouse midfielder still believes he can have a major impact for City in the future and remains fully committed to the cause. Another stumbling block towards a potential move is the four-time African Player of the Year winner's wages. Inter Milan, managed by Roberto Mancini, are interested but given his huge wages there are some doubts . Toure has more than two years left on his current £220,000-a-week deal and is unlikely to move for anything less. A number of clubs, such as Inter Milan, are interested in the 31-year-old, but given his huge salary there must be doubts over whether they would be able to afford it. Inter are prepared to offer Toure a five-year deal to compensate for the pay-cut he would be required to take if he moved to Italy — although, it remains to be seen whether he'd agree to such a compromise. There have been preliminary talks about a contract extension for Toure at City — which included the possibility of an ambassadorial role when he hangs up his boots. But it seems the club are now happy for him to leave. City, meanwhile, will resist any attempt by Valencia to pull out of a £24million deal for Alvaro Negredo to fund a move for Radamel Falcao, currently on loan at Manchester United. City will resist any attempt by Valencia to pull out of a £24million deal for Alvaro Negredo this summer . Negredo joined Valencia on loan last summer and the agreement included a clause involving a permanent move to the Mestalla. Reports in Spain  suggested that Valencia are having second thoughts about keeping Negredo next season, but City are adamant that the deal will go through as planned. The 29-year-old striker scored 23 goals in his first season at the Etihad following a £20.6m move from Sevilla, but he has only found the net five times for Valencia. When he scored in Monday’s 3-0 win over Levante, the Spain striker refused to celebrate, fuelling speculation over his future at the club. Negredo joined Valencia on loan last summer but reports in Spain say they are looking at Radamel Falcao . Victory kept Valencia in fourth place in La Liga and on course to qualify for the Champions League, but financial problems mean they are already struggling to hold onto key players like defender Nicolas Otamendi. It has, however, not stopped Valencia being linked with a summer move for Falcao, who is set to leave United at the end of his season-long loan from Monaco. Falcao’s agent Jorge Mendes has been acting as an advisor to Valencia owner Peter Lim and offloading Negredo is seen as one way of affording the Colombia star. City had scouts at Porto, watching their 3-1 Champions League win over Bayern Munich on Wednesday night, with the home team’s Brazilian left-back Alex Sandro said to be the main focus of interest.

"The majority of people taking antidepressants may not actually have depression, a new study claims. Researchers discovered more than two-thirds (69 per cent) of people taking antidepressants did not meet the criteria for major depressive disorder, which is also known as clinical depression. Antidepressants are also prescribed for other psychiatric disorders. But the researchers found 38 per cent of those taking the drugs did not meet the criteria for obsessive compulsive disorder, panic disorder, social phobia or generalised anxiety disorder either. Scroll down for video . More than two thirds of people taking antidepressants did not meet the criteria for clinical depression . The U.S. investigators looked at those taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), the most commonly prescribed type of anti-depressant. SSRIs are usually the first choice medication for depression and other psychiatric conditions because they generally have fewer side effects than most other types of antidepressant. Writing in the report,  published in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, the researchers concluded: ‘Many individuals prescribed antidepressants may not have met the criteria for mental disorders. ‘Our data indicates that antidepressants are commonly used in the absence of clear evidence-based indications.’ Commenting on the study, Dr Howard Forman, medical director of the Addiction Consultation Service at Montefiore Medical Center, said clinical depression is distinct from temporary feelings of sadness. He told Medical Daily: 'We all experience periods of stress, periods of sadness, and periods of self-doubt. 'These don’t make us mentally ill, they define us as human.' In the U.S., official guidelines say clinical depression should be diagnosed if a person has five or more depressive symptoms over a two week period, most of the day, nearly every day. The symptoms include a depressed mood; a loss of interested or pleasure in activities; weight loss, weight gain or changes in appetite; insomnia or increased desire to sleep.

Prescriptions for anti-depressants have more than trebled since 1998 in the world’s richest countries, a study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development found. The research noted a particular rise in in the use of SSRIs like Prozac and Seroxat. The OECD figures showed Iceland to have the highest prescribing rate, at 106 doses a day for every 1,000 inhabitants in 2011, up from 71 a decade earlier. Behind Iceland is Australia, then Canada, Denmark, Sweden and Portugal. The lowest levels were seen in Chile and South Korea. Separate data from the US shows 11 per cent of Americans over 12-years-old use anti-depressants. As part of the new study, doctors used data from the Baltimore Epidemiologic Catchment Area (ECA) Study Wave 1, which began in 1981, up to Wave 4, which ended in 2005. In total, they used data on 1,071 participants, carrying out four interviews and assessing the use of antidepressants. They found 13 per cent of people in the group reported using antidepressants. The study found 38 per cent of SSRI users did not meet the criteria for obsessive compulsive disorder, panic disorder, social phobia or generalized anxiety disorder or clinical depression (file photo) It's thought that SSRIs work by increasing the levels of a chemical called serotonin in the brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter (a messenger chemical that carries signals between nerve cells in the brain). It's thought to have a good influence on mood, emotion and sleep. After carrying a message, serotonin is usually reabsorbed by the nerve cells (known as 'reuptake'). SSRIs work by blocking ('inhibiting') reuptake, meaning more serotonin is available to pass further messages between nearby nerve cells. The NHS Choices website while it would be too simplistic to say that depression and related mental health conditions are caused by low serotonin levels, a rise in serotonin levels can improve symptoms and make people more responsive to other types of treatment. Source: NHS Choices . They then assessed whether the people in this group met the criteria for a mental disorder, as laid out in the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the U.S. bible for psychiatric conditions. They found that 38 per cent of SSRI users did not meet the criteria for a mental disorder, and 69 per cent did not meet the criteria for major depressive disorder. The news comes after a study found women who take antidepressants during pregnancy are more likely to have a baby with autism. The U.S. study supports previous research which has shown that taking SSRI antidepressants during pregnancy increases a woman’s risk of having a child with the developmental disability. And other American research revealed young adults taking high-dose antidepressants such as Prozac and Seroxat have double the risk of suicidal behaviour. Researchers pointed to previous studies, which found antidepressant drugs are linked with an increased risk of suicidal behaviour and thoughts in children and adolescents, particularly in the early stages of treatment.","Study analysed those taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)

"Lionel Messi is not the best player in the world, neither is Cristiano Ronaldo - that title belongs to Paris Saint-Germain forward Javier Pastore, according to Eric Cantona. Making a rare foray into discussing football matters, Manchester United legend Cantona delivered his surprising verdict that the Argentine was the ‘most creative’ player in the world. ‘The best player in the world, the most exciting player in the world, is [Javier] Pastore from Paris Saint-Germain,’ said Cantona, ‘Why? Because I watched two games just to see Pastore playing, giving passes. He has got something special. Because football is interactive, it's why football is so popular, I think.’ Javier Pastore (right) celebrates after winning the French League Cup with PSG last Saturday . The Argentina international is the best player in the world, according to former striker Eric Cantona . The former Manchester United forward was speaking at the Laureus World Sports Awards in Shanghai . Pastore, who cost the French league leaders £29million, has three goals and five assists this season compared with Messi’s 45 goals for Barcelona and Cristiano Ronaldo’s 51 for Spanish rivals Real Madrid. But statistics did not colour Cantona’s assessment. ‘Pastore can do things that the other ones don't know, he does things that surprise you every time. Not only in scoring goals, spectacular goals - everything. Just passing. He's a very creative player. He's the most creative player, I think, in the world today. It's why I think he's the best player in the world, because I love this kind of player.’ Cantona was third in the Ballon d’Or in 1993 behind Roberto Baggio and Dennis Bergkamp. He won the Premier League four times with United before retiring from playing aged 30. No stranger to prompting debate, Cantona invited more controversy by suggesting Spain had only won the World Cup because of the influence of Barcelona on the national team. Cristiano Ronaldo was crowned the best player in the world for 2014 at the award ceremony in January . The Real Madrid forward has scored 51 goals in all competitions this season . Barcelona forward Lionel Messi has also been overlooked by Cantona despite netting 45 times this season . ‘Catalonia won the World Cup,’ said Cantona, speaking at the Laureus World Sports Awards in Shanghai. ‘Spain won it with 10 Barcelona players in the team. Spain did not win the World Cup, Catalonia did. Barcelona won it. ‘My grandparents are from Catalunya, from Barcelona. They arrived in France in '39. There was a civil war. So, I am very proud of Barcelona and all that they have done. ‘I’m sure that as soon as the youth set-up from Barcelona and other Spanish teams draw new, good players, Spain will emerge again.’","Eric Cantona says PSG midfielder Javier Pastore is world's best player .

"Men with advanced prostate cancer could benefit from a pioneering drug originally meant for women. Clinical trials show that olaparib can delay the moment when the disease gets dangerously out of control. The drug already works for women with cancer fuelled by BRCA gene mutations, the defect that led to actress Angelina Jolie having her ovaries removed. New ‘exciting’ new research suggests the drug, already used to treat women with breast cancer, could also help men with genetic faults within their prostate cancer (pictured) tumours . Up to 30 per cent of men with advanced prostate cancer have tumours that have DNA defects and these respond particularly well to olaparib. The London trial of olaparib, which is owned by AstraZeneca, was led by researchers at the Institute of Cancer Research and the Royal Marsden hospital. They found 16 out of 49 men with advanced prostate cancer responded to the drug, also known as Lynparza. It stopped prostate cancer growth, generating lower tumour cell counts in the blood and improved responses in medical scans. The drug - called olaparib - can extend the length of time that a prostate cancer patient lives with the disease without it getting worse, according to new clinical trials. Olaparib is the first cancer drug to target inherited genetic mutations. It is one of the first of a new class of drugs called PARP inhibitors. PARP inhibitors work by blocking the cancer cell’s ability to repair damage. Cancer cells that have a mutation in a BRCA gene rely completely on the PARP protein to fix the damage. PARP inhibitor drugs suppress this protein and can stop BRCA mutated cells from growing so they eventually die. Side effects from traditional anti-cancer treatments are reduced because only cancer cells with genetic defects are targeted. Most of the men who had detectable DNA repair mutations had disease control lasting much longer than expected. This suggests the men most likely to benefit from the drug could be identified by testing to look for mutations. Olaparib became the first of a new class of drugs called PARP inhibitors to be granted approval last month for use in ovarian cancer by the European Commission and the US Food and Drug Administration. The inhibitors work by blocking the cancer cell’s ability to repair damage. Cancer cells that have a mutation in a BRCA gene rely completely on the PARP protein to fix the damage. The inhibitor drugs suppress this protein and can stop mutated cells from growing. Side effects from traditional anti-cancer treatments are reduced because only tumour cells with genetic defects are targeted. Professor Johann de Bono, who was the trial chief investigator, said: ‘This opens up the exciting possibility of delivering precise treatment for advanced prostate cancer, guided by genomic testing and based on the molecular characteristics of patients’ tumours. 'It shows that PARP inhibitors can be effective in a wider group of patients than had been thought – in men as well as women, patients with mutations in their tumours as well as those with inherited mutations, and in those with a wider range of gene defects.’ The drug, olaparib, is the first cancer drug to target inherited genetic mutations. It works by blocking the cancer cell’s ability to repair damage . Dr Emma Hall of the Institute of Cancer Research said: ‘We’ve seen a significant improvement in the length of good quality life men can hope to live even with the most advanced prostate cancers. 'These encouraging results show that olaparib could be the next drug to add to those already available.’ The results of the trial were presented at the American Association of Cancer Research conference in Philadelphia. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence will now decide whether olaparib should become widely available on the NHS. A decision is expected in September. Dr Iain Frame of Prostate Cancer UK said: ‘We want to get to a stage where every man gets the treatment he needs for his specific cancer.’ Researchers did not specify the length of time for which olaparib was able to stop advanced prostate cancer worsening.","Olaparib is the first cancer drug to target inherited genetic mutations .

"Former England captain Mike Gatting believes Kevin Pietersen should not walk straight back into the international set-up, even if he piles on the runs for Surrey this season. Pietersen has returned to the LV= County Championship in a bid to stake a claim for an England recall, although the 34-year-old only managed 19 runs against Glamorgan on Sunday. England were held to a draw in the opening Test of a three-match series against West Indies last week, and calls for a Pietersen comeback continue to linger ahead of the Ashes this summer. Kevin Pietersen scored 170 in his first outing for Surrey this season but scored just 19 against Glamorgan . 'There are a few bridges that still need to be rebuilt,' said Gatting, who had just penned a congratulation message to James Anderson, England's leading Test wicket-taker, as part of Slazenger's celebratory flag tour. 'Even if KP scores runs there might not be spaces available. If Gary Ballance, Ian Bell and Joe Root play well, there might not be a place for him. 'You've got to have somebody who isn't playing well to get Pietersen in. 'He doesn't just come straight back - that would be unfair on the people in there at the moment. 'If he does get runs, fine, but that's not the end of it. 'If people are playing well in the team, why should he just get straight in?' Pietersen is keen to play for England again after being sacked in 2014 . Bell and Ballance both hit centuries in Antigua while Root also showed signs of good form with scores of 83 and 59. The scorecard was less encouraging for England captain Alastair Cook, however, who could only manage 11 and 13, stretching his run without a Test century to 33 innings. Cook's poor performances saw him removed as One-Day captain before the World Cup earlier this year and Gatting admits more questions will be asked of the England skipper if he fails to find runs against West Indies. 'Alastair knows what he's got to do, he's got to get some runs,' Gatting said. 'We can keep speculating but I suspect at the end of the West Indies series, they'll look at it and if he hasn't got any runs there might be some questions asked. Gary Ballance scored a century in the first Test against West Indies . 'He might possibly get the series against New Zealand - the fact is Alastair has got more 100s than anyone else has and people do go through bad patches in their careers. 'Alastair has had a break, when he was left out of the One-Day series, he's had time to get himself sorted. 'Maybe he needs a break from the captaincy, that's for people to sit and decide, I suspect it's about the runs though, not the captaincy. 'He's a well-respected man in the team, the fact is he's a batsman, he's a captain and if he fails to get the runs somebody will have to make a decision.' Cook's future may be affected by who the England and Wales Cricket Board chooses for the new director of cricket role, created to replace sacked managing director Paul Downton. Mike Gatting has signed a giant flag congratulating Jimmy Anderson on becoming the leading England wicket taker in Test matches . Michael Vaughan, Andrew Strauss and Alec Stewart have all been mentioned in connection with the post, but Gatting is unsure what the point of the position will be. 'I've tried to think what the role could be,' Gatting said. 'If it's going to be someone more hands on with the team, how is that going to affect the coach? 'Can it be any different to the job Paul Downton did? You do need someone in charge of the overall structure. 'At the end of the day, it's all about the players - it's about how they perform. 'I just hope the ECB don't rush into the decision and they get the right person, because different people will do a different type of job.' Former MCC president Mike Gatting was signing Slazenger's 'Congratulations Jimmy' flag which will be touring the country this week. Slazenger is celebrating Jimmy Anderson becoming England's all-time leading Test wicket-taker by giving 10 per cent off its entire cricket range.

"No blame: Baroness Hale of Richmond said that she wanted to see the bitterness taken out of most matrimonial disputes . Divorce laws in England and Wales should remove the need for allegations of adultery and blame, Britain’s most senior female judge has said. Baroness Hale of Richmond said that she wanted to see the bitterness taken out of most matrimonial disputes so a person does not need to be held at fault in order to obtain a divorce. Divorcing couples currently have to cite one of five reasons: adultery; unreasonable behaviour; desertion for two or more years; two years’ separation with consent; or five years’ separation without consent. The second reason – unreasonable behaviour’ – is by far the most widely used. Around 120,000 couples divorce in England and Wales each year and those who want to divorce quickly are encouraged to cite unfaithfulness or unreasonable behaviour, which, critics argue, encourages recriminations. Lady Hale, who is deputy president to the Supreme Court and the only woman among the 12 Supreme Court justices, also wants couples to be made to sort out arrangements for children and money before obtaining a divorce as part of the overhaul. She told The Times: ‘We should make it take longer to get a divorce and encourage people to sort out what happens to the home, children, money before, rather than after, they get a divorce.’ Couples would have a one-year ‘cooling off period’ after declaring that their marriage had permanently broken down in order for them to sort out arrangements. Lady Hale, 70, was behind the move for ‘no fault’ divorce in England and Wales 20 years ago. Conservative MPs saw off the proposals and said that removing fault would take away responsibility and undermine the concept of marriage. Last night campaigners and lawyers backed the proposed overhaul. Resolution: Lady Hale also wants arrangements for children and money resolved before divorce is finalised . Sir Paul Coleridge, former family High Court judge and chairman of the Marriage Foundation, told The Times: ‘Lady Hale, a complete expert with decades of experience across this whole field, is entirely right. ‘Our current system which pretends to be fault-based is in practice and reality no such thing. 'The fault is largely invented to get a quick divorce — a hangover from pre-1970 days which is manipulated by lawyers and parties.’","Baroness Hale of Richmond wants to see 'bitterness' taken out of disputes .

"Manny Pacquiao has become one of the most recognisable stars in the world of sport after a series of mega-fights and another one to follow on Saturday night against Floyd Mayweather at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. The Filipino has been involved in some of the biggest bouts in the world over the past decade or so, facing the likes of Oscar De La Hoya, Ricky Hatton, Miguel Cotto and four fights against Mexican warrior Juan Manuel Marquez. But it's been a tough road to the top for Pacquiao from being born into poverty in the Philippines. He spent the early part of his career boxing in the Far East before being given his chance on the big stage in 2001 against Lehlo Ledwaba in an IBF world super-bantamweight title fight in Las Vegas.

Ever since dethroning the South African world champion on that June night at the MGM Grand 14 years ago, Pacquiao hasn't looked back and is set to take on Mayweather in the Fight of the Century on Saturday. Just days away from the $300million showdown on the Vegas Strip, pictures have emerged of Pacquiao as a teenager in a Manila boxing gym, when occasions such as this Saturday night were just a dream. Pacquiao moved away from home a the age of 14 to the country's capital Manila to pursue his boxing career and the rest, as they say, is history. The 36-year-old is now one of the biggest stars in the world. These incredible pictures show Pacquiao training at the LM Gym in Manila in 1996 at the age of 17 after he won his first 10 professional bouts - all of which were in 1995. In the same year that these pictures were taken, Mayweather was preparing to box at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, which ended for him in a controversial loss  against Serafim Todorov in the semi-finals. Nineteen years later, Mayweather and Pacquiao will finally cross paths in the biggest fight of this generation. The pair will make their first public appearances of the week on Tuesday as the bout draws ever closer. Boxing fans have already begun pouring into Las Vegas to taste the atmosphere building around the richest fight in history, even though only 500 tickets for the clash were made available for general sale. Pacquiao will host a fans' rally on Tuesday at the Mandalay Bay Hotel with trainer Freddie Roach, promoter Bob Arum and his pet Jack Russell Pacman also present. Attention then turns to the MGM Grand, the venue for the fight on Saturday and where Mayweather will be making his grand arrival. The welterweight rivals were both due to attend the traditional grand arrival that marks the beginning of fight week only for Arum to withdraw Pacquiao, claiming the event is a 'waste of time'. Arum also pulled the plug on a media conference call with Pacquiao last week before a question had been asked, while Mayweather spoke for almost half an hour the following night. The one upmanship is sure to continue until fight day. Pacquiao has been involved in some of the biggest fights over the last decade but Saturday's occasion will eclipse all of them .

"These shocking photographs show the bed where a severely disabled boy was left to sleep for seven nights in hospital. They show two mattresses squeezed together on the cramped hospital floor, with wires from an oxygen tank and tubes dangling across the room. Cody Neatis, from Preston, was admitted to Royal Preston Hospital last Thursday with a chest infection. But rather than a bed in the children's ward, has had to sleep on a mattress on the floor since arriving. The eight-year-old - who has Down's syndrome, epilepsy, autism and is fed by a tube - has been without a hospital bed because staff do not have the special cot he needs to keep him safe in his sleep. Cody Neatis, eight, has been in hospital for a week with a chest infection but has had to sleep on a mattress on the floor as the hospital doesn't have a suitable bed for him to sleep in . Cody has Down's syndrome, epilepsy, autism and is fed by a tube. The hospital does not have the specialist high-sided cot he must sleep in, to prevent him from injuring himself in the night . Cody's mother, Lynne Neatis, 48, has had to sleep with Cody - who has a developmental age of 12 months - on the mattress. She watches him sleep in case he pulls out his oxygen or hurts himself in the night . His mother, Lynne, 48, has slept on the floor alongside him for the past week. She fears her son - who has a developmental age of around 12 months - will injure himself or pull out his oxygen. She is now demanding answers from the local health trust as she claims she has waited two years for the high-sided bed needed for Cody and other disabled children. The mother-of-six said: 'Cody was admitted to hospital last Thursday and we were told there was no special needs bed for him. 'This situation has been ongoing  for years with this hospital and I don't understand why they still don't have a suitable bed. 'We had to stay in for nine days in August 2013, I complained about it then and was told that the ward was getting a special needs bed. 'So I fully expected them to have it this time, but there is still nothing.' She added: 'They have baby cots and single beds with side rails, but they aren't safe as Cody rolls around so much in his sleep and is restless all night long. 'I have to sleep on the floor with him and I have had to fight for a nurse or health care assistant to be with us during the night to watch him too as I can't stay awake for 24 hours. 'It has been a very stressful and exhausting time.' Cody's father Stephen Neatis, 45, said he 'cannot believe' his family are forced to sleep on the floor during their stay in hospital . Cody's mother says she has been battling the hospital for a special bed ever since Cody was forced to stay there two years ago in 2013 . While Mrs Neatis is furious at the lack of provisions for disabled children, the hospital trust insists it has ordered a suitable bed from America and is waiting for it to arrive. Karen Partington, chief executive at Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the hospital, said other sleeping arrangements had been offered, but the family had agreed a mattress on the floor would be the safest option at this point. She added: 'We offered Mum the options of a traditional bed plus 1:1 nursing staff and we also brought in a special bed again with 1:1 nursing. 'We believe we have appropriate beds available to meet the needs of Cody along with appropriate nursing support. 'However based on the options available her preference was for Cody to have a mattress on the floor.' Mrs Neatis and husband Stephen, 45, are full time carers not only to Cody, but his brother Dexter, seven, who is also disabled and has autism and ADHD. Cody has to be tube fed and cannot be left unattended. At home he sleeps in a specialist bed which cost more the family more than £3,000. Mr Neatis said he cannot believe his family are forced to sleep on the floor during a stay in hospital. Cody, pictured here with his father, has to be tube fed and can't be left unattended. At home he sleeps in a specialist bed which cost more the family more than £3,000. Mrs Neatis says she has had to ask for staff to come and help her watch Cody sleep, as she can't stay awake 24 hours a day . He said: 'I just can't believe that there is nothing to cater for him, or that they wouldn't try to at least get something for him during the stay. 'I got a call from Lynne and she is having to stay with him on the floor. 'We have one of the special needs beds at home and I saw the two guys assemble it, it took half an hour so it wouldn't be a big job to move one. There must be one somewhere.' Mrs Neatis threatened to take Cody home after finding out the sleeping arrangements but his oxygen levels fall dangerously low when he is taken off the ventilator so he cannot be discharged. She said she was told the hospital did get a special bed and used it on a trial basis, but it proved unsatisfactory. She said: 'When they came up with the idea of sleeping on a mattress on the floor I told them I would take him home as we had a bed there but his oxygen levels were too low. 'I told staff he needs someone to watch him all night long but they made me feel like I was being awkward and said they had no staff to do that. 'I took the photo of Cody and the floor and sent it to my friend who tweeted it and that night we had a nurse, and for the next two nights we had a health care assistant, they were great. Mrs Neatis said when she first heard about the sleeping arrangements at the hospital, she said she would take Cody home. But his oxygen levels were so low that he couldn't be discharged . Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, who run Royal Preston Hospital, say they have ordered a special bed from America and are waiting for it to arrive . The chief executive came to see me and she was really nice. 'But on the fourth night they said there was a staff shortage again so I threatened to take him home - I took his oxygen out but they insisted we stay, and someone did come to watch him. 'Other hospitals have these beds and special needs children are admitted to hospital more often than other children so I don't understand why it's so difficult here. The bed wouldn't be left unused, she claims. She said: 'I know of other parents who have had the same problem and have brought their own special needs beds with them from home.' A spokesperson for the trust told MailOnline that a specialist bed from America was due to arrive in February, but the delivery was delayed. Chief executive Ms Partington added: 'Our priority is to always provide excellent care with compassion for our patients and we have had several discussions with Cody's family regarding his care. 'We are awaiting delivery of a specialist bed from America and we have discussed a number of alternatives with Cody's family, which have been declined.' 'Clearly when making these decisions regarding the care of children we believe it is important to do so in collaboration with parents. We continue to work with her to find a solution that meets Cody's needs and his mum's preferences.'","Cody Neatis, 8, has Down's syndrome, epilepsy and autism and is tube-fed .

"The devastated fiance of the late 'wellness warrior' Jessica Ainscough has written an emotional letter to her followers, revealing she was undergoing radiation treatment in her final weeks and 'giggling and drinking green smoothies' in her hospital bed until the day she died. Ms Ainscough, 30, died in late February following a lengthy fight with a rare and aggressive form of cancer known as epithelioid sarcoma. She spurned chemotherapy and radiation, choosing to fight the cancer with a controversial treatment known as Gerson Therapy, which involves a vegan diet and coffee enemas and does not have scientific support. But after discussions with 'oncologists, healers and specialists around the world', in her final weeks - the most 'difficult' weeks of her fight - Ms Ainscough began a course of targeted radiation, her partner Tallon Pamenter has revealed. 'This was a risky and tough decision, but Jess bravely embraced this last chance option,' he said. Jessica Ainscough (left) was planning to marry her partner Tallon Pamenter this year. She died after a long fight with cancer in February . 'This year has stripped me from the one thing that brought magic to every other aspect of my life,' Mr Pamenter said . Tribute: Jessica Ainscough died in late February after a seven-year-long battle with cancer . 'In true wellness warrior style, we integrated our natural healing regime with the recommended radiation. 'Finally the walls were broken down between conventional and unconventional medicine - I don't know why as a society we must choose one or the other. 'This was something Jess was looking forward with sharing (with her followers). It was an exciting evolution from her earlier days of feeling that she had to be part of one extreme world or the other.' Mr Pamenter said the six weeks of her radiation were among the toughest the couple - who were planning to marry this year - had been through. 'Jess displayed a sense of courage and grace that I am yet to see in anybody else I have ever met - myself included.' The radiation successfully managed to shrink the tumour but 'some complications arose during the final stages of treatment'. 'Not long after, the words I LOVE YOU would leave my lips only to fall softly upon Jess's ears for the last time. 'I said goodbye to the love of my life that day and my heart has been in a million pieces since.' 'Jess displayed a sense of courage and grace that I am yet to see in anybody else I have ever met - myself included,' She 'showed (her partner Tallon) what it means to live in a world full of love', he said in his tribute . 'I said goodbye to the love of my life that day and my heart has been in a million pieces since' 'This year has stripped me from the one thing that brought magic to every other aspect of my life. 'I have been taken to a place so foreign and unknown with no navigational bearing on how to get back. 'Loved ones tell me to be strong during this time... but the thing is I don't want to be strong... I want to cry when I'm sad, yell when I'm angry and smile during those fleeting moments of happiness brought on by the memories we created together. 'I want to sit in silence and be present with every single emotion that decides to show up. 'It's in those moments I feel closest to her.' Ms Ainscough made the decision to undergo radiation after the fungating tumour in her left shoulder became large and painful. It began to interfere with her 'ability to enjoy her favourite things like walking our furbabies on the beach', Mr Parmenter said. Mr Pamenter told Daily Mail Australia she planned to tell her followers about her new treatment just days after she passed away. Ms Ainscough was diagnosed with cancer in 2008 when she was 22 and working at Dolly magazine, a favourite of teenage girls. She initially underwent targeted chemotherapy to her left arm, according to reports, but the cancer returned a year later. She also refused doctors' advice to have her left arm amputated. Jessica's mother was also diagnosed with cancer in 2012, and, inspired by her daughter's fight, she also adopted the Gerson Therapy method. The alternative treatment did not work, and her mother passed away in 2013, an event which Ms Ainscough said brought her to her knees. Mr Pamenter said his partner 'showed me what it means to live in a world full of love'. She was laid to rest in early March.","Devastated fiance of late 'wellness warrior' Jessica Ainscough writes touching tribute to followers .

"West Bromwich Albion had just produced a typical Tony Pulis performance to beat his former club Crystal Palace 2-0 when he claimed he will never change. The 57-year-old’s gritty, resilient playing style is well reflected in the touchline attire he insists on wearing at every game; cap, track suit and shiny white trainers. James Morrison headed in within two minutes and Craig Gardner added a stunning 30-yard strike in the second half, but Alan Pardew’s side dominated the remainder of the game only to be met by West Brom’s stubborn doggedness.

West Brom midfielder James Morrison (right) dribbles with the ball away from Palace's Jason Puncheon (left) All viewed by Pulis beneath the peak of that cap. ‘I’d never take my cap off during a game they’d have to put it in my contract,’ he explained. ‘I watched the first game for Albion and sat upstairs in a suit. I came down after 10 minutes because I’d had enough of sitting there. That’s just the way I am. I want to be close to the action.’ West Brom ended their run of 10 away games without a victory, drawing five and losing five. Pulis will turn up to the stadium in suit and tie, then return to that again straight after the match to address the press before he leaves. Pardew was resplendent in full suit and tie on Saturday. Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino admitted last week that he started smartening up on the sideline after his chairman Daniel Levy told him to. ‘I’ll leave it for all the sophisticated lads,’ Pulis added. ‘I’ve always done it and I don’t see no reason not to just because we’re in the Premier League with all the TV cameras and everything. I’ve done it right from my days at Bournemouth.’ Why change a ritual that works? The three points moved West Brom to 36 points which virtually guarantees them safety. Much like he achieved at Palace last year. That’s worth doffing your cap to. Palace winger Wilfried Zaha (left) is tackled by West Brom's Gardener (right) during the match on Saturday .

"Countdown co-presenter Rachel Riley was left embarrassed on a recent episode of the show when contestants offered up a rather rude eight-letter word as their answer to the word game. Host Nick Hewer faced a conundrum of his own as he tried, and failed, to stifle his giggles as a blushing Ms Riley spelt out the word 'erection'. Hewer, who first found fame as Lord Sugar’s sidekick in The Apprentice, was clearly trying not to laugh when Dubliner Gerry Tynan and Anne Lewin, from Brighton, both offered up the double entendre. Scroll down for video . Countdown co-presenter Rachel Riley looked embarassed when the two contestants  came up with the same eight-letter double entendre in the word game (pictured) as host Nick Hewer failed to stifle his laughter . Fortunately celebrity guest Dr Phil Hammond, who was in dictionary corner with Susie Dent, saved the day with nine letter word 'recondite'. It is not the first time the show's host has struggled to contain himself when a rude word has popped up - last year Hairy Biker Dave Myers offered up the seven-letter word 'todgers', causing much hilarity among the hosts. In February an English teacher shocked viewers when submitting the word 'm*nges', an expletive sometimes used to describe female genitalia. It is not the first time Nick Hewer (pictured) has struggled to contain himself when a rude word has popped up . In 1991, two contestants offered 'w***ers', and in 2010 another suggested 's**tface'. In 2010 the presenters looked uneasy when the letters U, D, F, C, K and E all came up in a selection - but luckily the contestants resisted the temptation to go for the obvious and instead submitted the five letter words 'caged' and 'faced'. It's not the first word to have left Rachel Riley blushing. The former Strictly Come Dancing star found herself stifling laughter after drawing the words 'p*ss' and 'a*se' shortly after replacing Carol Vorderman in 2009. During her 26-year stint, Ms Vorderman was left red-faced more than a few times. Words such as fart, porn and poo were among the collection of letters which had the Loose Women star and her co-hosts laughing.

"Prince Harry will tonight fly out of the UK to Australia without seeing his new niece or nephew . A disappointed Prince Harry will tonight fly out of the UK to Australia without seeing his new niece or nephew. With the Duchess of Cambridge now overdue for the birth of her second child, the prince will not be able to meet the new royal baby until he returns to this country in mid May. Harry, who will be bumped down to fifth in the line of succession by the new arrival, had returned briefly at the weekend to hand out prizes at the London Marathon after undertaking several engagements in Turkey to mark the centenary of the Gallipoli campaign. He was dragging out his return until tonight in the hope of getting to meet the new little prince or princess. But with Duchess now several days overdue, Harry is being forced to return to Australia where he is on a month-long placement with the army, followed by a week long official tour of New Zealand. Instead he spent time playing doting uncle to his nephew, Prince George, who turns two in July, at the Cambridge's apartment at Kensington Palace. Kate and her husband, Prince William, had been told to expect their new son or daughter – who will be fourth in line to the throne – by Saturday, according to sources. The Duchess – whose son, Prince George, was also around a week late - herself told well-wishers earlier this year that the new little prince or princess was due 'mid to late April'. When Prince George's little brother or sister is born the news will be revealed to royal correspondents in a press release followed by an announcement two minutes on the Kensington and Buckingham Palace social media accounts on Twitter and Instagram. Details of their arrival – including their six, birth weight and details of the attending medical staff - will then be posted in the traditional way on an easel outside Buckingham Palace. Scroll down for video . Although palace officials have barred media from camping outside the private Lindo Wing at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, where Kate is due to give birth, in order to prevent what they describe as a 'media circus', excitement was mounting yesterday with royal 'superfans' continuing their own round-the-clock vigil. The Duchess – whose son, Prince George, was also around a week late - herself told well-wishers earlier this year that the new little prince or princess was due 'mid to late April' Harry had returned briefly at the weekend to hand out prizes at the London Marathon after undertaking several engagements in Turkey (pictured) to mark the centenary of the Gallipoli campaign . The mounting tension saw bookmakers' cash in with a flurry of bets on everything from the time of birth to the new baby's name – and even their hair and eye colour. Prince Harry will no doubt be encouraged to see that 4/1 odds are being offered for the baby to be a fellow red head. Ladbrokes customers appeared to favour Arthur for a boy, with odds collapsing to 8/1, and Alice remaining the hot favourite for a girl with odds of just 5/4. Some were still hankering after Diana (14/1), in memory of William's late mother, or even Elizabeth in honour of the Queen (6/1). The firm said one male customer in the Manchester area had bet £10,000 on the new baby being a girl, the largest single wager so far received. Spokesman, Jessica Bridge, said: 'As far as the money is concerned they will soon welcome Princess Alice into the family.' Coral said yesterday that it had seen a slew of bets come in that the baby will arrive today (Monday) – now 6/1 joint favourite – with odds of 10-1 that the nation is still waiting at the end of the week. Many bookmakers are also offering 4/1 odds of the couple welcoming their new child into the world on Wednesday – their fourth wedding anniversary. Prince William and Kate pose with their son Prince George at the National History Museum in London . Preparations have been made outside the Lindo Wing of the hospital for the huge crowds expected to welcome the royal birth - with the Duchess said to be up to four days overdue . As the 'spare to the heir', it is unlikely that the duke and duchess's new baby will accede to the throne – although it is not unheard of. Most recently the Queen's own father became King George VI when his elder brother, King Edward VIII, unexpectedly abdicated over his love for 'unsuitable' American divorcee Wallis Simpson. Thanks to recent changes in the law of succession, if the new baby is girl then their claim to the throne cannot be superseded by a younger brother, should William and Kate go on to have a third child. She will also be known as HRH Princess (forename) of Cambridge after the Queen altered a century-old ruling in the run up to Prince George's birth which had meant that only the eldest son of a Prince of Wales (as well as the children of a monarch and the sons of those children) was entitled to the honour. The new arrival will also bump Prince Andrew out of the 'top five' for the first time. He will drop to sixth in line to the throne. His eldest daughter, Princess Beatrice, will find herself relegated to seventh – the advantage being that she will no longer require the Queen's approval for her marriage. Her younger sister, Princess Eugenie, will become eighth. If the baby is a girl it will be the first Princess of Cambridge to be born for 182 years. Kate has said in the past that she favours a boy but that her husband rather likes the idea of a girl. Grandfather Prince Charles has said he would like a girl – while his late wife, Diana, Princess of Wales, always longed for a daughter.","Prince Harry will  fly out of UK tonight to continue placement in Australia .

"Jameela spent £3,000 on having all her amalgam fillings removed and replaced with white fillings . Jameela Jamil has the dazzling smile that you'd expect of a television presenter and former model. Yet the 29-year-old broadcaster is convinced her teeth - or rather, the dental work done on them - triggered a host of health problems that plagued her for nearly seven years. 'From the age of 21, I would wake up in the morning with a puffy, swollen face feeling utterly hungover - even though I don't drink,' says Jameela, who has presented the Radio 1 Chart Show and programmes for Channel 4. 'My head felt heavy and I was permanently exhausted. Occasionally, I would even faint. There were days when I'd arrive at work and the make-up artists would send me home because I just looked awful and felt terrible.' After several months of this, she went to a private doctor who referred her for tests. Jameela thought she might have a serious disease such as lupus, an auto-immune condition which can cause inflammation and swelling in the joints and other parts of the body. In fact, the tests suggested she had high levels of mercury. After other potential causes such as diet were ruled out, it was suggested the problem was down to the ten amalgam fillings she'd had as a child. So she spent £3,000 on having them all removed and replaced with white fillings. Dental amalgam has been used for more than 150 years, and every year 12 million fillings made from it are given to patients in Britain. Amalgam remains a standard material to use, especially on back teeth because it is particularly robust. It is made from a mixture of metals including silver, tin and copper. Liquid mercury is used to help mix these components together. Breathing in extremely high concentrations of mercury can trigger bronchitis and pneumonia and affect the central nervous system, causing muscle tremors. Long-term exposure to high levels can affect kidneys. But mercury poisoning is very rare, suggests Dr Prem Mahendra, a consultant haematologist at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham. 'In 27 years as a haematologist I have never been asked to test for mercury,' he says. Dentists agree that when fillings are being put in or removed, the mercury can release vapour. This is absorbed into the bloodstream in the lungs and then taken to the kidneys to be passed out harmlessly in the urine. Blood tests showed she had high mercury levels. With nothing else to account for these raised levels, her fillings were pinpointed as the cause . But the amounts taken in from fillings is 'minuscule', says Salford dentist Dr Ben Atkins. Indeed, a review by the EU Commission's Scientific Committee in 2008 concluded there was no risk from amalgam, says Professor Damien Walmsley, the British Dental Association's scientific adviser. Amalgam is 'strong, durable and adaptable' and there is 'no evidence to suggest these fillings are anything other than safe to use', adds StJohn Crean, professor of medicine in dentistry and an oral and maxillofacial surgeon at the University of Central Lancashire. It is true that mercury can sometimes cause sensitivity and soreness in teeth - 5 per cent of the population react to contact with amalgams in this way - but this poses no risk to health, adds Professor Walmsley. And yet dental amalgam is banned in countries such as Sweden and Norway, because of patient concern about the risk. Finland and Japan have restrictions on its use, with a view to phasing it out. This follows research linking mercury to certain diseases. A 2012 review of 106 studies published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease suggested mercury from amalgams could be a contributing factor to the condition. But fillings aren't the only source of mercury. It can get into the blood through food - nearly all fish and shellfish contain traces, though the Food Standards Agency says this isn't a concern for most people. However, some fish and shellfish contain higher levels of mercury that could harm an unborn baby or young child's developing nervous system. That's why young children and women planning to have a baby or who are already pregnant or breastfeeding are advised to avoid fish that can have higher levels of mercury, such as shark, swordfish and marlin. Pregnant women are advised to limit their tuna to no more than two steaks or four medium-sized cans a week. And yet dental amalgam (pictured, posed by model) is banned in countries such as Sweden and Norway, because of patient concern about the risk . But Jameela doesn't eat fish, so knew the mercury levels couldn't be due to her diet. She's allergic to peanuts, shellfish and dairy foods and at 12 was diagnosed with coeliac disease - a condition which causes an adverse reaction to gluten, found in wheat, barley and rye. Following blood tests, it was discovered that she had high mercury levels. With nothing else to account for these raised levels, her fillings were pinpointed as the cause. 'All I could think of was I had to get rid of them,' says Jameela. But while she expected her symptoms to immediately subside once her fillings were removed, they continued to affect her over the next few years. 'I hated the fatigue, the headaches, the fact I should have been fit and healthy but felt rotten all the time,' Jameela says. 'I read up on this and discovered that not only does it take time for mercury levels to drop, but vapour can be released from the mercury when the fillings are removed and leak into the system. 'I think that the mercury was affecting my immune and digestive system.' Dentist Dr Atkins has spoken to many patients who have wanted to have their silver fillings removed because they're concerned about the potential health issues. But he warns that removing amalgams can do more harm than good as more vapour can be inhaled into the system by doing this. 'Aside from the fact there is no evidence to suggest amalgams are anything other than safe, every time a dentist drills a tooth, they remove a little dental tissue. So you are essentially damaging the tooth,' he says. The number of fillings in the average adult's mouth . Still struggling, Jameela saw a nutritionist who recommended drinking solutions made from clay and algae chlorella three times a day. These apparently bind to mercury and help remove it. She did this for two years, and tried various diets to tackle the 'inflammation' linked to the mercury that was making her ill. 'For my 25th birthday, my flatmate gave me a piece of melon with a candle in it - cake was out of the question,' she says. 'It took about a year before I started to feel better. It's all had a massive impact on my life.' However, Anton Emmanuel, consultant gastroenterologist at University College Hospital, London, is not convinced mercury could affect digestion in this way. 'You would have to be exposed to massive overdoses of mercury for the gut to be affected,' he says. 'Not in the level or forms that you get with mercury fillings. 'In fact, I see patients whose gut symptoms, ironically, seem to be caused by the stress and anxiety of thinking that it is their mercury fillings which are causing stomach problems, when there is no physical sign of any gut disorders.' But Jameela remains convinced that the mercury was the cause of her problems. 'There is so much we don't know about amalgam fillings. I know I feel much better now,' she says. Private clinics offer mercury testing. But Dr Mahendra says anyone thinking of having this done should check that the clinic's laboratories have clinical pathology accreditation (CPA) to ensure that the tests are carried out properly. Jameela is supporting Allergy UK to raise awareness of food allergies and is ambassador for Holland & Barrett’s Free From range .","Jameela Jamil, 29, is convinced dental work triggered health problems .

"Sao Paulo, Brazil (CNN)Hundreds of thousands of Brazilians are taking to the streets in protests across the country, lashing out against President Dilma Rousseff as she struggles with an economic downturn and a massive bribery scandal. The demonstrators have called for the President to be impeached. On the other side Rousseff's base is holding rallies in her support. There are a number of issues at play. One of the biggest: an investigation into a multimillion-dollar kickback scheme at the state-run oil company Petrobras. Petrobras was long considered the corporate jewel in Brazil's crown, one of the biggest companies in the world by market capitalization. But last year, investigators launched a sweeping investigation. According to suspects-turned-witnesses, construction companies paid bribes to executives at Petrobras as well as politicians to secure lucrative contracts. Most of the politicians accused in the investigation belong to the President's Workers Party and its allies. During many of the years that the alleged corruption took place, Rousseff was the chairwoman of Petrobras. There hasn't been any evidence she was involved with the scheme, and her supporters say the position is merely a figurehead. Rousseff has defended Brazilians' right to protest and acknowledged the need to clean up corruption at Petrobras -- but denied any prior knowledge of it. But Brazilians are still outraged. Rousseff won re-election with just over 50% of valid votes in October, but her approval rating plummeted to 13% after the protests last month. Compounding the frustration is the economy, which is expected to contract this year. Inflation is stubbornly high, and the currency has lost more than 20% of its value against the dollar this year alone. Both sides are. The country was already sharply divided during presidential elections in October. Roughly half of the voting population didn't vote for Rousseff, and many of those same people joined protests immediately after elections. Rousseff's supporters like to characterize the protesters as Brazilian elite and right-wingers, and some small groups do carry signs calling for a military intervention to oust the President. But with the Petrobras scandal growing and the economy sinking, the protests have gotten bigger and broader, with many demonstrators saying they initially voted for Rousseff. Protesters say Rousseff should be impeached for failing to halt the corruption at Petrobras. On the other hand, labor unions, social activists and groups such as the Landless Workers Movement who support the government have organized their own marches. The demonstrations are meant as a show of force for democracy, with participants saying the President was democratically elected and cannot be impeached. But participation has not been consistently strong. The President has said Petrobras should be cleaned up. Has she done anything about it? She says she's given prosecutors and the Federal Police free rein to investigate the Petrobas scandal. Some of her allies who have been implicated in the investigation think Rousseff should do more to protect them. This scandal has been known publicly for at least a year, and during Rousseff's election campaign, she said she would root out corruption. The Brazilian economy was booming for the good part of a decade, bolstered by voracious demand for its commodities from China. But with China's economy cooling, Brazil has failed to find a successful alternative to promote growth and shore up investor confidence. Now, with the President's approval rating abysmally low, it will be difficult to implement the savings needed to get the economy back on track. Rousseff has appointed a market-friendly economy minister, Joaquim Levy, to try and fix the country's fiscal problems. But in the current political crisis, he hasn't been able to make much progress.","Protesters angry over bribery scandal involving state-run oil company Petrobras .

"An alleged fraudster has been accused of posing as Oprah Winfrey, executives from her TV network, former Obama aide Reggie Love and Madonna's manager in an attempt to trick people into giving him jobs, clothes, free food and jewelry worth $2.4million. Justin Jackson, a Florida man, has been carrying out the bizarre schemes in the hope of cashing in on the freebies, or winning himself a job in luxurious hotels, according to court documents. Jackson is being sued by Oprah's TV network as well as Love - the college basketball star who went on to be the President's personal assistant. 'Con man': Justin Jackson, right, has been accused of pretending to be a host of celebrity-linked characters in order to score freebies and jobs. Angel Agarrat, left, is also named in a Florida lawsuit attempting to get the pair to stop posing as other people . Legal papers filed in a south Florida federal court describe Jackson waging an eight-year trail of deceit in which he variously posed as Oprah herself, Oprah's nephew, Love, an executive at the Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN), and managers of Madonna and Johnny Depp. The earliest fraud, the papers said, saw Jackson trick a New York City jeweler into lending him items worth $2.4million by pretending to be Madonna's manager. He contacted a store in July 2007 and said she needed the lavish items for a photoshoot, the papers said. When he got the items, he reportedly sold them to another jeweler and fled. The court papers say he was convicted for grand theft over the ruse, but later dreamed up new celebrity-linked schemes. The latest claims say Jackson pretended to be Oprah and her representatives in the hope of getting more freebies - and even posed as the famous talk show host to recommend him for jobs. He allegedly sent letters on forged OWN stationery to  five different hotel groups with locations in Florida, recommending himself for work at the locations. 'Impersonator': Jackson (right) is accused of sending messages purporting to be former Obama aide Reggie Love (left), whom he said worked for Oprah. The right-hand photograph, court papers claim, was emailed from an email account allegedly belonging to Johnny Depp's manager, asking for tickets to see Oprah . The papers claim some of the notes purportedly to be directly from Oprah, while others claimed to be from Love, who was signed off as the star's 'executive assistant and personal aide'. Also named in the claims was Angel Agarrat, whom lawyers claim was also involved in the deception, and was subject of some of the bogus letters of recommendation for jobs. In one of the exchanges, Jackson allegedly suggested that if he and Agarrat were to be given work at the hotels, Oprah would make a personal appearance there. One letter even claimed Jackson was Oprah's nephew. Love has never worked for Oprah. Other schemes allegedly saw Jackson write to four different jewelry companies, as well as a clothe retailer, to get free goods allegedly meant for Oprah. Scheme: According to the claims, Jackson signed some emails off as Oprah, left, and others as Scott Garner, an executive at the Oprah Winfrey Network . The claims date from around September 2013 to the end of 2014. The documents also say Jackson has a history of pretending to be Love, and had tried in 2010 to trade off Love's own name to get free designer clothes, handbags and Cheesecake Factory vouchers. In a final case, Jackson . OWN, Love and Scott Garner, an executive at Oprah's company whose name was used, filed a joint suit against Jackson and Agarrat this week. It accuses the two of invasion of privacy, misappropriation of names, infringing trademarks and conspiracy. The documents ask that a judge files an injunction to stop the two using any of the false names, and also stakes a claim for financial damages. Although no figures are specified, arguments in the court papers imply that the figure will be at least $75,000.","Justin Jackson allegedly pretended to be celebrity-linked characters .

I train hard at it and I feel that's why I stand out from the rest,' he said ahead of Monday's two-day warm-up against a St Kitts & Nevis Invitation XI. 'I feel like I'm adaptable but you might need those little patches in the game - where it's a bit dead and there's good batters - to try and rough them up a bit. 'That's why I'm in the team, because I do bowl fast. 'I'm not a bowler who runs up and just hits line and length all day, I want to do something, I want to ruffle batsmen up. If that's what I'm asked to do, I'm happy to do that.' With James Anderson and Stuart Broad likely to retain new ball duties for the first Test in Antigua on April 13, Plunkett is fighting for a place with Barbados-born Chris Jordan and the uncapped Mark Wood. There is a case to be made for both his rivals, Jordan being more familiar with conditions in his homeland and Wood an unknown quantity to the opposition, but Plunkett relishes the scrap. 'It's a good unit, a good bunch of lads and we're all working hard. There's massive competition,' he said. 'It's up to me to bowl well in practice and in the warm-up games and get the chance to play in the first Test. 'You don't want to just get in easily. You want to feel like you've earned your place and outbowled the other guys. You want to be the best bowler. 'Last summer I felt the best I had in my career, I felt good with the ball, I felt confident. Plunkett is fighting for a start in the England Test side with Chris Jordan and Mark Wood . Plunkett (second left) could feature in a warm-up game for England that begins on Monday . 'I felt I was in a situation where I could win games for England. It didn't quite happen but I bowled nicely. 'Then I got the injury, went away this winter with the Lions and I feel good again. I got some wickets and some good rhythm so it would be good to play that first Test.'

"Freddo Frog has shrunk from 15g to 12g . Cadbury is cutting the size of its beloved Freddo Frogs by 20 per cent but keeping the recommend retail price the same. The miniature chocolate amphibians, which weighed a plump 20g two years ago - before they dropped to 15g, will now weigh just 12g. The shrinking of one of Australia’s most popular children’s chocolates was not widely announced but was in fact spotted by a shop owner who stocks the treats, the Herald Sun reports. Cadbury’s spokesman Julian Polachek said: ‘We’re making a change to the size of the product because of manufacturing cost increases that we can no longer absorb.’ The Freddo’s downsize is just the latest product to feel the pinch in the declining confectionery world. In February, chocolate lovers expressed their anger after Cadbury announced plans to reduce the size of their family blocks by ‘one row’ in a cost cutting deal. The best-selling blocks dropped from 220 grams to 200 grams. The Australasia managing director for Mondelez International, Cadbury’s parent company, Amanda Banfield told the Financial Review: ‘Clearly any chocolate lover is going to be a bit disappointed.’ Anticipating a backlash, Ms Banfield explained the company had decided the shrink the family block because of ‘unprecedented cost headwinds’. She blamed the increased price of ingredients and rising packaging costs for the change. Cadbury still recommends the blocks are sold for $4.99 – a price which won’t increase or decrease – but Ms Banfield highlighted that shops set the prices that they choose to sell the products at in store. Cadbury's parent company’s profit before tax rose 46 per cent from $87 million to $127 million in 2013. Thousands of angry chocolate fans complained about the change on Cadbury’s Facebook page. Creator of the Freddo Frog, Harry Melbourne, who thought up the idea of the chocolate frog named Freddo when he was an 18-year-old. He died aged 94 in 2007 . Cadbury have reduced the size of their family block of Dairy Milk by one row of chocolate . Tony Abbott carefully pours chocolate into a mould during a visit to the Cadbury chocolate factory in Hobart . Rebecca Isaako wrote: ‘You turned a $127 million dollar profit last financial year. This is complete & utter baloney!’ Kyria Economidis said: ‘What do you take us for? You guys are thieves, you want to cut it down and charge us the same? You are plain greedy.’ ‘Good bye Cadbury it has been a fun ride, but when you make it not worth it and unaffordable and then lie pffft not worth wasting my money how much would it cost to change the size of the chocolate with new moulds smaller packaging lots of money I would assume. I'll just wait for the tim tams to go on sale,’ Kirsty Logan commented. Nestle has sliced its Killer Python lolly in half in a bid to help Australians better manage their health . Cadbury chocolate produced for the Australian market is made in Claremont in Tasmania. A statement on the company’s website read: ‘Confectionery companies around the world are feeling the squeeze of increasing costs. At Cadbury, we’re feeling it too. We’ve reached a point where we can no longer absorb these increasing costs into the price of our chocolate blocks.’ In October last year, Cadbury rival Nestle sliced its Killer Python lolly in half in an apparent bid to help Australians better manage their health. The new 'treat size' Allen's Killer Python measures 21cm instead of 32.5cm and weighs 24g instead of 47g. Nestle has also reduced the size of Smarties 'fun size' boxes from 20g to 16g. The move is part of Nestle's efforts to help Australians improve their health by controlling the amount of food they eat - 'especially treats'. The company said the Killer Pythons still have the same 'recipe, taste and stretchiness' but the new size cuts the lolly's kilojoules from 630 to 336, meaning a 10-year-old can run it off in 30 minutes instead of one hour. Customers have expressed their outrage over the move but Nestle's General Manager of Confectionery, Martin Brown, said it was the 'right thing to do'. Nestle has also reduced the size of Smarties 'fun size' boxes from 20g to 16g . The new 'treat size' Allen's Killer Python measures 21cm instead of 32.5cm . 'I think lollies are just such a fun part of growing up and people have got a lot of passion for them, I really understand that, l used to love eating Killer Pythons as a kid,' Mr Brown told Daily Mail Australia. 'I can understand why there will be some disappointed Python fans, it's a short term sacrifice because it will upset customers and we'll sell less Pythons but it's the right thing to do for ongoing trust. 'This is a really important initiative for a product primarily eaten by kids, getting it at the right portion.' When Red Rock Deli chips dropped 20 grams from their packets the prize remained the same . The company said the new treat size Killer Pythons bags are the same price as the old ones, but have gone up in weight, so customers will be getting more lolly snakes in smaller portion sizes. The recommended retail price on individual Killer Pythons will be halved from $1 to 50 cents. In the past manufacturers have been called out for slashing product sizes while keeping the same packing and price. Red Rock Deli-Style potato chips were shrunk by 20 grams. And Choice spotted Oat Crisp Honey cereal packets were reduced by 14 per cent while maintaining similar packaging and that the price per 100 grams increased by 10 per cent.","Cadbury's Freddo Frogs have decreased from 15g to 12g .

"Forget dogs' dinners, stylish cook Gizzi Erskine's fussy feline loves poppadoms, tortilla chips and taramasalata. In an interview with Puss Puss magazine, the stylish cook, 35,  posed at a feast fit for only the classiest cat, that included bowls brimming with caviar and salmon roe, jellied fish heads, a seafood sculpture made of octopus, lobster and prawns. Although the lavish feast was in fact a set (created by food stylist Iain Graham), the cat fancier admitted that her British shorthair, Kimchi, has such a discerning palate he loves crunchy 'human food'  and that taramasalata would be his 'death row dish'. Draped in peach silk and surrounded by cat delicacies, TV chef Gizzi Erskine appears with her pet Kimchi in cat magazine, Puss Puss . The TV chef seen baring her back tattoo with pet cat Kimchi says: 'I’d love a really small cat tattoo either behind my ear or somewhere discreet' In the shoot for the publication that pitches itself as a Vogue for cat lovers, the east London-based cook told writer Gemma Lacey: 'She won’t eat anything unless it’s proper meat.' Adding that Kimchi, 'loves human food and will steal it off our plate if we’re not looking. 'She loves anything crunchy, so if there are poppadoms or tortilla chips around that’s it. I don’t like her having it as they’re not supposed to, but she just takes it. But Gizzi insists that living in a foodie household isn't to blame. 'It’s not my influence at all, she’s just a pig!'

When I make taramasalata she’ll eat and eat and eat it, it’s her death row dish. 'She loves cheese, caviar and anything really fishy.' But Kimchi occasionally indulges in cat food and is 'obsessed' with Dreamies cat biscuits. 'It’s insane,' says Gizzi. 'She purrs as she eats and she doesn’t do that normally.' Gizzi also recently added a new addition to her cat family, Ponzu, named after her favourite Japanese dressing. 'I was also thinking about calling him Neeps or Haggis as he’s Scottish, but it didn’t suit him, so eventually I just went with what suited him best. He was nameless for a week,' she says. 'Kimchi is called Kimchi because of my love of Korean food,' she adds. The new addition to the Erskine feline family is also a food lover - and has even more unusual tastes.

"A group of U.S. senators has written to football's world governing body FIFA, calling for Russia to be removed as host of the 2018 World Cup because of its role in the Ukraine crisis and occupation of Crimea. In a letter dated Tuesday and released on Wednesday, the 13 Democratic and Republican U.S. lawmakers said they 'strongly encourage' FIFA to move the global competition. 'Allowing Russia to host the World Cup inappropriately bolsters the prestige of the (Russian President Vladimir) Putin regime at a time when it should be condemned and provides economic relief at a time when much of the international community is imposing economic sanctions,' the senators wrote to FIFA President Sepp Blatter. FIFA president Sepp Blatter announces Russia as the host nation for the 2018 World Cup . Republican John McCain is one of 13 US senators urging FIFA to think again . The lead signers were Senator Robert Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Senator Ron Johnson, the Republican chairman of the foreign relations panel's Europe subcommittee. Republican Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, also signed the letter, as did Senator Richard Durbin, the number two Democrat in the Senate.

Meanwhile, England are interested in bidding for Euro 2028 but are very unlikely to bid for the 2026 World Cup, FA chairman Greg Dyke has revealed. FIFA announced last week that the decision on the 2026 tournament will be made in 2017 - when Blatter is still likely to be FIFA president.

"A Spanish town on the Camino de Santiago pilgrimage route is warning pilgrims and other visitors to stop defecating along the famous path. Graphic signs telling visitors not to stop for a poo break during their walk to the holy city of Santiago de Compostela, in north-western Spain, have been erected in the municipality of Lastres. But no one knows who put up the signs, which show a squatting figure defecating within a red circle with a diagonal line across it. Someone in the municipality of Lastres has posted signs warning pilgrims not to defecate on the trail . The pilgrimage, known as the Way of St James, attracts thousands of pilgrims every year, but there can be very few places to go when nature calls. In Lastres, angry residents have complained about pilgrims defecating outside their homes. The signs are posted next to warnings that urge people not to litter. The pilgrimage begins at various points, with the longest route nearly 500 miles from the Spain-France border, which lead to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, where Saint James the Great is said to be buried. Antonio Fernandez, a resident of Lastres, told Spain’s EFE news agency that the signs are found to be so amusing they have become an attraction. Some pilgrims will walk nearly 500 miles (800 kilometres) to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela . Pilgrims and other visitors are now stopping to pose for photos with them, he added. Two other residents, Jose Ramon Fernandez and his wife, Maria Paz, said they were surprised the warning signs were posted, as the pilgrims ‘are very polite’ and ‘always friendly’. Lantres is a parish in Santos, and its mayor said ‘it makes no sense’ that there are no public facilities for pilgrims at regular points during their long journey on the historic route. Julio Gallego told the Spanish newspaper La Voz de Galicia that it is a ‘huge failure’ that needs to be remedied.","No one knows who put up the signs in the municipality of Lastres .

The Liverpudlian continued to still largely control the fight but Luis showed plenty of aggression himself, coming forward and making life difficult for Mathews, landing a good uppercut of his own at the end of the sixth. Luis' pressure and all-action style was beginning to tell on Mathews, who was more and more often going to the ropes and both men were deducted a point in the eighth, Mathews for a low blow and Luis for use of the head.

"Planners in Windsor have allowed two Costa cafes less than 500 yards apart (file picture) Coffee addicts in Windsor won't have to go far for a fix – after planners in the royal borough allowed two Costa shops less than 500 yards apart. And anyone really desperate can always stop off at the Costa Express in between. The latest Costa will open on the site of the former Dedworth Road HSBC branch, the last bank in the area before it closed last year amid protests. Less than 500 yards away is a Costa which replaced a cycle shop earlier this year. It means there will be two Costas just a brisk five-minute walk apart, plus the Costa Express at a petrol station between them. One resident, Samantha Taylor, wrote online: 'I think it's mad and I wish our local councils could see that we are drowning in fast food and coffee shops in Windsor.' However, Matt Gordon-Smith said: 'The important point here is that this is in Dedworth which formerly wouldn't have had such businesses coming here. 'Surely places like Costa coming in rather than another fast-food shop or betting shop - there will soon be three within a mile - is that a sign that this part of Windsor is on the up?' Costa's planning application says the new shop would be a 'significant driver to local trade'. Planners said there was no legal reason to refuse. Costa were unavailable for comment.

"There is an image of Jose Mourinho and Pep Guardiola deep in conversation during a Barcelona training session that did the rounds on social media a few years ago. Mourinho was Bobby Robson’s assistant at Barcelona and Guardiola was in his final years as a player at the Camp Nou at the time. The picture became the perfect ‘guess the caption’ competition the best one having Guardiola say to Mourinho: ‘I’ll be Barça coach one day and I’ll win the treble’ and Mourinho replying: ‘yeah right, and I’ll manage Real Madrid.’ Jose Mourinho and Pep Guardiola in deep conversation following a Barcelona training session . No sooner had Luis Enrique joined Barcelona at the start of this season and the photo libraries threw up an even better shot – one of Luis Enrique, Pep and Jose in their time at Barcelona. Then the archive scanners began to notice something about some of the other faces in the pictures from this era – isn’t that current PSG coach Laurent Blanc? And isn’t that current Porto coach Julen Lopetegui? And aren’t four of the coaches of the last eight in this season’s Champions League from the same club at the same time? (From L-R) Barcelona's Juan Carlos Busquets, Luis Enrique, Mourinho and Guardiola at training . Laurent Blanc comes up against Enrique at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday in the Champions League . Blanc was a huge part of the Barcelona XI that won the Spanish Super Cup under Bobby Robson in 1996 . Luis Enrique comes face to with Blanc in the Parc des Princes stadium on Wednesday night and both will have plenty to catch up on. They were both in the Barça team that started the 1996-97 season by winning the Spanish Super Cup against Atletico Madrid 6-4 on aggregate. With Robson in charge and Mourinho’s assisting him the team that won the first silverware of the new season included not just the French World Cup winner and the 62-times Spain international and the aforementioned Lopetegui and Guardiola but Albert Ferrer, who started the season as Cordoba coach; Abelardo Fernandez, who is now coaching Sporting Gijon in Spain’s second tier; and Sergi Barjuan, who has just taken over at Almeria.

Also in the team were Hristo Stoichkov who has coached Celta Vigo and Bulgaria among others and Juan Antonio Pizzi, who managed Valencia last season and is now at Leon in Mexico. Even those players from that team who never went on to manage have stayed in football with Giovanni now working as a scout for Olympiakos and Guillermo Amor a former director of Barcelona’s youth academy who is now director of football at Adelaide United FC. Among the squad players that season were Roberto Prosinecki and Emmanuel Amunike now coach with Azerbaijan and Nigeria’s Under-17s teams respectively.

Enrique travels to Paris to take on Blanc's PSG side at the Parc des Princes in the Champions League . Ahead of his meeting with Blanc on Wednesday, Luis Enrique crossed swords with old friend and former team-mate Sergi Barjuan two weeks ago when Barça played Almeria. “It was the last thing we looked like becoming,” he said when I asked the Barcelona manager if both he and Sergi had looked like coaches-in-waiting in their playing days. “You change the way you look at things once you retire.” Luis Enrique believes those who played in positions where they had the pitch in front of them for most of the game – the full-backs, the centre-backs, Pep Guardiola in holding midfield – went on to coach in part because of how tactically astute they had had to become to be successful in their positions as players. Former Argentinean striker Juan Antonio Pizzi went on to manage Valencia and is now in Mexico . Julen Lopetegui: Porto boss . Albert Ferrer: Former Cordoba coach .

Michael Laudrup: Former Swansea, Getafe and Mallorca coach . Juan Carlos: Coaching role at Valladolid . Julio Salinas: Television pundit . Hristo Stoichkov: Former Bulgaria and Celta Vigo coach . It’s perhaps more of a surprise that so many attacking players also graduated to the technical area. Some will have got jobs because they played for Barcelona rather than because of all they learned at Barça – it’s the irresistible pull of giving a Barça old boy a job in the hope he will be able to build a side in his former team’s image. But for every failure there has been a success and there is a 50 per cent chance that whoever wins this season’s Champions League, via the coach, Barcelona’s prints will be on the trophy.","Four of Bobby Robson's 1996 squad are still in the Champions League .

"A selection of thirsty animals were captured drinking water in their own unique way – and the results are hilarious. Elad Hershkowitz, a zookeeper at the Zoological Center in Tel Aviv, placed a GoPro camera at the bottom of water troughs to capture the different perspectives. The animals – ranging from a rhino who almost kisses the surface of the water to a lemur who delicately licks it – were recorded for a total of 30 hours. Zookeeper Elad Hershkowitz, of the Zoological Center in Tel Aviv, filmed animals drinking on a GoPro camera . He placed the camera in the animals' water troughs and filmed them  for a total of 30 hours . The 26-year-old then cut the final footage down to four minutes. He said: ‘Capturing this footage was really special. It offers a completely unique perspective to anything I’ve ever seen before. ‘I had the idea whilst walking around the enclosures and I saw the zebras drinking. ‘It made me curious to see what was going on below so I decided to check how the rest of the animals drink. Hershkowitz said some of the animals were initially sceptical about the foreign object in their troughs . A commanding rhino appears to almost kiss the surface of the water after it purses its lips and takes a drink . ‘There is a massive difference in how each animal drinks. Carnivores, like lions, drink a lot like domesticated cats and dogs. Herbivores like the rhinos and zebras suck up the water with their lips.’ According to Mr Hershkowitz, some of the animals were initially sceptical about the foreign object placed at the bottom of their trough. He said they attempted to check them out by putting their hooves and paws into the water first before going to take a drink. Eventually however, they got used to the camera’s presence and drank freely. A lemur is featured in the four minute footage and delicately licks the surface of the water with its tongue . A herd of zebra humorously bare their teeth while gently sipping the water from their trough . The zookeeper also anticipated a range of reactions from the animals before the experiment and ensured that the camera was secure before it took place. ‘I was really worried the lions would bite off the GoPro, so I placed a sheet of acrylic glass above the camera,’ he said. In the clip the lion can be seen aggressively breaking the surface of the water with its tongue, and is in complete contrast to a herd of zebra, who humorously bare their teeth while gently sipping.","A zookeeper at the Zoological Center in Tel Aviv recorded the footage .

"A couple who chose to forsake their dream wedding in order to pay for one final shot at IVF are celebrating giving birth to twins and even found a way to say their 'I do's' Becca Litchfield, 29, and partner Dale, 30, from Gotham, Nottingham, were heart-broken when they discovered their savings would only be enough to cover the cost of a wedding, or fertility treatment. Desperate for a family, the couple chose to sacrifice their dream wedding and go ahead with IVF, but were over the moon when weeks later they became winners of a wedding competition. Becca and Dale Litchfield decided to give up their dream wedding in order to have one last shot at IVF and have since welcomed twins,  Darci-Mai (left) and  Stanley (right) The happy couple said their vows, and were overjoyed when they discovered the fertility treatment had worked - and Becca gave birth to twins Stanley and Darci-Mai. The full-time mother says that the couple can't believe their luck having achieved both of their dreams. 'When we realised we'd couldn't have children and get married, it was heart breaking,' she said. 'It was devastating to give up one of our dreams. We knew that we weren't getting any younger so the best option was to try IVF one last time, and sacrifice the wedding. 'It was a risk, because the IVF could have failed - and we'd have ended up with neither. 'But when we won the wedding competition, and then found out I was pregnant, it was unbelievable. Although they had given up on the idea of their perfect wedding the couple were blessed with yet another stroke of luck when they won a wedding contest which allowed them to finally get married . Before they conceived Darci-Mai (right) and Stanley (left) Becca and Dale had attempted two rounds of IVF . 'Now I've got my dream - the perfect husband and children, I couldn't be happier.' Becca and Dale, first started IVF treatment in 2012 after a year of failing to conceive naturally. The couple spent £5,500 on two rounds of IVF, keeping back an additional sum of money that they planned to spend on their wedding day. But after two failed attempts, Becca and Dale were forced to make a decision, Becca says that it was an incredibly difficult one to make. 'We were spending all of our money on IVF treatment hoping we'd conceive but after we failed twice I wondered if I'd ever get pregnant,' she said. 'We planned to use the spare money to get married but knew because of our ages we'd have to have kids now or never. 'I'd always dreamt of feeling my baby kick for the first time and the bond after giving birth, so I knew we had to try IVF one last time.' After winning the wedding competition the couple were able to have the white wedding they had always wanted . Becca, pictured with Darci-Mai (left) and Stanley (right) In order to conceive, Becca, pictured with Darci-Mai, had to take three hormone injections a day but she says it was entirely worth it . After abandoning hopes of a big celebration the couple decided to at least secure their relationship with a proposal. 'We were advised to wait for a year before trying again - I was just counting down the days,' she said. 'It felt like time was ticking away so quickly. At the end of the year, Dale and I officially became engaged - it was a way to lift our spirits and we thought if we couldn't have a big wedding, we could at least get engaged.' But unbeknownst to Becca, during their year long wait for IVF, Dale, who works as an electrician, entered the pair into a win a wedding competition. Becca says that once again fate was in their favour having initially been runners-up. Becca says that she and Dale couldn't stop beaming when they discovered they were expecting twins . 'We actually came second in the competition, but then the first place dropped out and so we won,' she said. 'We couldn't believe it - after all the heart ache and the decision making, we were getting both. 'It felt like a miracle. I'd always dreamt of a big white wedding and walking down the aisle, but I'd put that to the back of my mind. 'I couldn't believe my dreams were going to become a reality.' After the wedding, the pair changed fertility clinics and had their final round of IVF. It was here that medics discovered Becca had low hormone levels and started to treat her for the problem, giving her three hormone injections a day to increase the chance of her falling pregnant . When Becca first discovered she was pregnant she was so shocked she took four tests to make sure. She gave birth to twins Darci-Mai (left) and Stanley (right) Becca says that it was a challenging period but she was prepared to carry on in hope of having her dream family. 'I felt like a pin cushion while I was having all the treatment but knew it was worth it. 'Then after the eggs were implanted I took two weeks off work to relax and do nothing other than sit with my legs up in the hope it would help us to get pregnant. 'Then we did a pregnancy test and it was positive. We didn't want to get our hopes up but after four more tests said we were pregnant I believed it.' Overjoyed with the news Becca was then astounded to find out that she was not carrying just one baby but two. 'Once I knew I was pregnant I had a feeling we were going to have twins and when doctors confirmed it we couldn't believe it. 'When the doctor told me there were two heartbeats we were all gobsmacked. The twins were born on 27th September last year . Becca says that even when the Darci-Mai (left) and Stanley (right) are screaming she feels lucky to have them . 'Me and Dale sat beaming at each other, we couldn't believe we were about to have one baby let alone twins.' The twins were born in September last year and six months later the couple still can't quite believe their luck. Becca said: 'It's amazing to think how dramatically our life changed in one year - we got married and now have a beautiful boy and girl. 'Even now I still feel so privileged to have children - even when they are screaming I keep thinking thank goodness that they are with us. 'Before I thought of myself as very unlucky, I'd never won anything in my life. 'But since winning our wedding and having kids it still doesn't feel real. 'I've definitely used my life's worth of luck now but I don't care because I've got everything I ever dreamed of so I'm happy. 'Finally everything's gone right, we are finally married parents after everything we've been through it is incredible.'","Becca and Dale Litchfield spent their wedding savings on IVF .

"Just a quarter of voters think David Cameron is hungriest to win the election, a poll reveals today as the Prime Minister tries to step up his campaign passion. After criticism of a dull campaign from the chillaxing PM, Mr Cameron used an interview to insist he was working 'bloody hard' to secure a majority. But only 25 per cent of people think he wants to win most, compared to 43 per cent who believe Ed Miliband is most up for the fight. Scroll down for video . Some 43 per cent of voters think Ed Miliband 'comes across as wanting to win the most' when compared to David Cameron . Opinion polls continue to suggest the result is too close to call, although two surveys yesterday put the Tories ahead, including one which gave them a six-point lead. But while Mr Cameron is frequently seen as the strongest leader when compared to Mr Miliband, voters appear to think he wants to win less. In a YouGov survey for The Times, 43 per cent of voters think Mr Miliband 'comes across as wanting to win the most' when compared to Mr Cameron. Only 25 per cent thought Mr Cameron was hungriest for the job, and 13 per cent said neither of them. Mr Cameron appeared without a tie or jacket again today at Kelvin Hughes in north London as part of a 'sleeves rolled up' strategy designed to show he is fighting hard for a Tory victory. Meanwhile, Mr Miliband is giving a speech on how a Labour government would tackle immigration. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, riding high after strong TV debate performances and a surge in the polls, was judged to be enjoying the fight more than anyone by 34 per cent of voters . Just 7 per cent also thought Mr Cameron was enjoying the campaign the most out of all the main party leaders. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, riding high after strong TV debate performances and a surge in the polls, was judged to be enjoying the fight more than anyone by 34 per cent of voters. Ukip's Nigel Farage was the second happiest leader on 16 per cent, followed by Mr Miliband on 13 per cent. In recent days senior Tories and business backers had begun to criticise the campaign, warning it was dull and suffering from a 'curious lack of energy and belief'. Former Prime Minister Sir John Major warned against relying on dry economic data, when people want to know how their lives will be better. David Cameron appeared without a tie or jacket again today at Kelvin Hughes in north London as part of a 'sleeves rolled up' strategy designed to show he is fighting hard for a Tory victory . More people think Ed Miliband is hungriest for a win and appears to be enjoying the campaign more than his Tory rival . Mr Cameron appears to have taken the criticism to heart, making a series of passionate stump speeches in the last 72 hours. After weeks of criticism that the Conservatives were running a boring campaign, the Prime Minister found the fire in his belly as he declared in London yesterday: 'If I'm getting lively about it it's because I feel bloody lively about it.' In an interview with The Times today he adds: 'The real David Cameron has been standing up and working bloody hard for the last five years. 'I'm feeling pumped up. There's ten days to go, it's a bloody important election and I'm determined to get across the line. The line is victory — and victory is a Conservative majority. I know the polls are tight but victory is doable.'","Poll shows 43% think Labour leader Ed Miliband wants to win the most .

"France's biggest handball star Nikola Karabatic will stand trial for fraud over his suspected involvement in an illegal betting case. Karabatic, a multiple world and Olympic gold medalist, and his younger brother Luka were among a group of players banned by the French league two years ago for betting on the result of a match in which their Montpellier club, which had already secured the title, lost to a struggling team. Karabatic's lawyer Michael Corbier told Sportsmail on Wednesday the trial will likely take place within months. French handball star Nikola Karabatic has been accused of match fixing along with 15 others . Former Montpellier ace competes for France in Handball World Cup match against Iceland in January . 'We would have preferred the charges to be thrown out, but we'll aim for a not-guilty verdict,' said Corbier. 'In theory he is facing five years in prison and a fine, but even a suspended sentence of just half an hour in jail would be too much.' Karabatic, who was briefly detained when the case emerged, now plays for Barcelona in the Spanish league. Karabatic leaves the Montpellier's courtroom after attending his appeal in October 2012 . Other former or current Montpellier players including Mladen Bojinovic, Samuel Honrubia, Dragan Gagic, Primoz Prost, Issam Tej and Mickael Robin will also be tried. Karabatic has denied placing bets on the match that Montpellier lost 31-28 to Cesson-Rennes. Betting authority Francaise de Jeux reported an unusually high increase in betting at halftime in the match, raising suspicions and triggering a police investigation.

"Kicked out: Elizabeth Sedway, 51, says Alaska Airlines had her ejected from a flight because she has cancer and lacked a doctor's note clearing her to fly . A married mother of two battling cancer has been ejected from an Alaska Airlines flight from Hawaii to California along with her family because she lacked a doctor's note clearing her to fly. Elizabeth Sedway, 51, from Granite Hill, California, posted an emotional video on her Facebook page Monday showing her family being kicked off a packed plane. Mrs Sedway, who suffers from multiple myeloma - a rare form of plasma cancer - detailed her ordeal in a status update accompanying the short video, which has been shared nearly 10,000 times as of Tuesday evening. In the message, the mother of two explained that she was sitting in the handicapped section of a boarding area at Lihue Airport on Kauai when an Alaska Airlines representative noticed she had put on a surgical mask to shield herself from germs and came up to her asking if she needed anything. Mrs Sedway initially said she was fine, but when the airline employee approached her a second time, she indicated that she might require a little extra time to board the plane because she sometimes felt 'weak.' Homeward bound: The married mother of three, her husband (right) and their two sons were returning home to California Monday after vacationing in Hawaii when they were kicked off the flight . Caught on camera: Sedway posted an emotional video on her Facebook page Monday showing her family being kicked off a packed plane . In Sedway's video, her husband is seen removing their carry-on luggage and helping their sons out of their seats . Brought to tears: As the family of four walk towards the exit, Elizabeth Sedway breaks down and tearfully apologizes for holding everyone up . The Sedway family eventually boarded the plane and were awaiting takeoff in their seats when an airline representative came on board and announced that the cancer-stricken passenger could not fly without a note from her doctor. In Sedway's video, her husband dressed in a brightly colored Hawaiian shirt is seen removing their carry-on luggage and helping their sons out of their seats while his wife narrates their removal from the flight. 'All these people are waiting, and I am being removed as if I'm a criminal or contagious because I have cancer,' she says. 'My family is being forcibly removed from an airplane because I have cancer and no note to fly.' As the family of four walk towards the exit, Elizabeth Sedway breaks down and tearfully apologizes for holding everyone up. One of the passengers tells the woman, 'God bless you.' In an interview with NBC Bay Area, Elizabeth Sedway said the airline was concerned she might collapse during the eight-hour flight to San Jose, California. After being asked to leave the plane, Mrs Sedway emailed her oncologist in California and he gave her the green light to fly, but she told the local NBC affiliate in a phone interview that the airline was not satisfied and refused to let her re-board. Named and shamed: Sedway shared this photo of Alaska Airline staff at Lihue Airport on her Facebook page, identifying them as the employees whom she had to deal with during the incident . Damage control: Alaska Airlines later apologized to the family for mishandling the situation . The Sedways spent Monday night in a hotel in Maui, for which they were forced to pay out of pocket, and they were scheduled to return home on a Hawaiian Airlines flight Tuesday evening. Elizabeth Sedway lamented on her Facebook page that because of the delay caused by Alaska Airlines, she will miss two chemotherapy sessions, her husband will miss important meetings and her sons will miss school. Earlier today, a spokesperson for Alaska Airlines told CBS San Francisco that the company apologized to Elizabeth Sedway for the inconvenience and for the way its employees handled the situation. ‘Her family’s tickets have been refunded and we will cover the cost of her family’s overnight accommodations in Lihue,’ Alaska spokeswoman Halley Knigge stated. ‘While our employee had the customer’s well-being in mind, the situation could have been handled differently.’","Elizabeth Sedway, 51, has rare plasma cancer and was returning to California with her husband and two children from Hawaii vacation .

"From 'here's you a piece of pizza' to 'this glass needs washed', every state has its own set of phrases that can seem bizarre to the rest of the English-speaking world. In New York, for instance, there's a tendency to use the word 'so' for drama, such as 'I'm so totally over this.' Some people in San Jose think nothing of saying 'didn't nobody help him', while Florida residents can be heard using the phrase, 'I ain't never had no trouble with none of 'em.' Click on a location marker in the map below to hear common phrases for each state . All of my clothes needs washed - Idaho . ..and wadn't anybody home but me - Alabama . Don’t none of y’all work as hard as I do - Virginia . We all use night-crawlers anymore - Iowa . I so might run this [race] with you - California . I ain't never had no trouble with none of 'em - Florida . You are so in the Doghouse for that on - New York . Twitter can be a professional job anymore - Nebraska . Now researchers at Yale University have revealed these patterns by documenting the subtle differences in sentence structure across the US. Their interactive map allows you to click on a location and see common phrases for a region, as well as its source. While the map focuses on the US, it also has a small amount of data for the UK, with sentences such as 'yer lugs needs washed' used in Scotland and 'Ne mon nule don hum no good', in Aylesbury. 'Unlike variation in phonology (often referred to as accent) and in the lexicon (different words), variation in grammatical systems within English has for the most part not been systematically investigated,' says Larry Horn, professor of linguistics and philosophy at Yale University. 'This variation may be found among speakers who live in a certain geographical region, or who belong to a certain age group, or to a particular social or ethnic group,' he adds. During the past year, members of the project have been conducting nationwide surveys using an online crowdsourcing platform asking for people's judgment on sentences. The researchers were not interested in what is considered to be correct  grammar, but in what people do naturally. As well as the map, the team has also created a comprehensive guide that lists the different types of sentence structures used. One of the most interesting discoveries  are presentative sentences like 'Here's you a water bottle.' 'That sentence just floored me,' says postdoctoral associate Jim Wood, a Yale University lecturer in linguistics. 'It seemed very alien and different to me.' The overall pattern was clear; In the South people found that sentence to be completely normal, while in the North, it was almost unheard of. From 'here's you a piece of pizza' to 'this glass needs washed', every state has its own phrases that can seem odd to the rest of the world . 'It's a reason didn't nobody help him', is a common sentence structure used in San Jose, claims the study authors at Yale University . While the map focuses on the US, it also has a small amount of data for the UK, with sentences such as 'yer lugs needs washed' used in Scotland (left) and 'Ne mon nule don hum no good', in Aylesbury. And New York isn't the only region that uses 'so' to add emphasis to a sentence. Londoners also appear to have picked up the habit (right) 'It was pretty stunning, and it turns out you can do it with ""where"" as well. ""Where's me a screwdriver?"" or ""Where's me a place to eat around here?""' he added. Other notable examples include ‘Don’t none of y’all work as hard as I do’ in Virginia; ‘we all use night-crawlers anymore’ in Iowa; and ‘I ain't never had no trouble with none of 'em’ in Florida. Meanwhile, people in New Haven sometimes use 'so don't I', such as in the sentence, 'he plays guitar, but so don't I'. Linguistics Professor Raffaella Zanuttini explained that there is also a social implication to this research. 'Often people are convinced that there is a right way of speaking a language and a wrong way of speaking that language. 'From the point of view of a linguist, that is really off the mark for many reasons,' she says. 'We linguists can see through this, because we have a more scientific approach to language,' says Zanuttini. 'We believe that creating an awareness of what we consider to be basic facts about language can have a positive social effect, by making people aware that they are expressing a negative evaluation of others.' In New York, as well as California, the map shows there's a tendency to use the word 'so' for drama, such as 'I'm so totally over this' Linguistics Professor Raffaella Zanuttini explained that there is also a social implication to this research.

"Labour received more than £1 every second from trades unions in the second week of the election campaign, official figures revealed this morning. Union barons gave more than £700,000 to Ed Miliband’s party, swelling Labour’s election war chest for the last 14 days of the campaign.

Unison general secretary Dave Prentis (left) and the Unite chief Len McCluskey (right) have boosted Labour's election campaign with donations worth more than £400,000 between them . Most of the Tory cash came from wealthy individuals, who handed over £460,000. Christopher Rokos, who was a co-founder of hedge fund Brevan Howard Asset Management, donated £170,000 - the largest single amount in the period - to the Tories.

They will call the tune and the British people will pay the price.’ By law, political parties must submit weekly donation and loan reports to the commission if they are standing candidates in the UK parliamentary election and they have received any donations or loans over £7,500.

"Internet users were left scratching their heads after an old hoax video showing a wave rider surfing in front of the Sydney's Opera House started trending for a second time. The video was uploaded to Twitter on Tuesday morning by popular Sydney radio duo Fitzy and Wippa, before quickly being reposted by a spell of other sources.

YouTube commenters were quick to point out inaccuracies in the video, such as the appearance of rocks around the Opera House and the cardboard-esque appearance of the man in the final shot. It was also rebutted by several wave experts who vowed it was a sham.

"We all need a helping hand sometimes, and nobody more so than Kecil the baby orangutan, who had a tough start to life after his natural mother and another surrogate mother rejected him. But the one-year-old ape found love at the third time of asking with second surrogate mother Maggie at Chicago's Brookfield Zoo, and has today been pictured cuddling up to the experienced mother ahead of his first public outing this weekend. Maggie, 53, who has already raised one surrogate child, has proved herself yet again by helping to raise Kecil (pronounced Ka-cheel) for the past 10 months, and the two now have an inseparable bond. Scroll down for video . Taking care: Maggie, 53, wraps a protective arm around Kecil the baby orangutan who she has been raising for the past ten months after his mother and a surrogate mother both rejected him . Inseparable: Zookeepers were nervous that Maggie might reject Kecil after raising four of her own children and another surrogate which was given to her in 2002, but she has proved her parenting prowess once again . When the pair appeared in front of news crews earlier today, Kecil began crying after losing sight of Maggie for a few moments. But the elder orangutan quickly returned, at which point Kecil quietened down and scooted over to join her, reports the Chicago Sun Times. Kecil had to be moved from his birthplace at Toledo zoo, in Ohio, 14 months ago after his natural mother failed to bond with him properly after birth. He was moved to Milwaukee County Zoo and given to a second surrogate, but she did not form a bond with him either. In a final attempt to find a parent for Kecil, he was handed over to Maggie, the oldest orangutan in North America, who has already raised four children of her own, and a fifth surrogate which was given to her in 2002. The pair immediately showed signs of intimacy, but zookeepers still faced a tense wait to see if the elderly orangutan would take on full parental duties. Nava Greenblatt, one of the zoo’s lead primate keepers, said that the turning point came when a fire alarm sounded at the zoo a few weeks ago, frightening Kecil, who ran to Maggie and cuddle up to her. Turning point: Keepers in Chicago said the turning point for Kecil came a few weeks ago when a fire alarm went off on the zoo, frightening him. Usually he turned to people for comfort, but instead he ran and cuddled up to Maggie . Big day: After settling into his new enclosure, Kecil will go on display for the first time this weekend in two hours slots between 10am and midday, allowing him to nap in the afternoons . Getting into the swing of things: Keepers said when Kecil and Maggie were first put into their new enclosure, the older ape would wander too far ahead, and Kecil would get lost, but the pair have now learned to stick close to one another . She said: 'Initially when he would be feeling insecure he would turn to people, and then there was a shift where he would turn to Maggie if he felt insecure. That was a big milestone. He really needs her to learn how to be an orangutan.' The pair will eventually become part of an exhibit featuring the zoo's four other orangutans, but at the moment they are living in isolation, as would be the case in the wild. Kecil will be on display on Saturday and Sunday at Brookfield Zoo's Tropic World Asia enclosure between 10am and midday. The other orangutans will be allowed into the enclosure around those times to help them acclimatise as well. Hanging out: The pair will eventually become part of an exhibit featuring the zoo's four other orangutans, but at the moment they are living in isolation, as would be the case in the wild . Happy monkey: Keepers said: 'On his first day out he was wide eyed and a bit amazed. He stayed close to Maggie and whimpered if she moved too far away. We saw many joyful reunions those first few days as they separated and found one another again'","Kecil the one-year-old orangutan was taken to Chicago zoo after being rejected by his mother and surrogate mother .

"Listening to The Beatles could help to enhance the enjoyment of a fish and chip supper, psychologists have found. Research suggests that certain types of music can bring out specific flavours - including sweet, salty and bitter - in a range of foods. The intensity of Nessun Dorma, performed by Luciano Pavarotti, is said to be the perfect accompaniment to dark mouse or coffee. Meanwhile, the high-pitched piano in Billie Holiday's Autumn in New York can help emphasise the autumnal flavour of a pumpkin pudding. Listening to the right sort of music, including the Beatles (pictured) can enhance flavours in certain food and drink, researchers have found . In the Ultraviolent restaurant in Shanghai, fish and chips (pictured) are served up to a backdrop of the Beatles . In Ultraviolent restaurant in Shanghai, fish and chips are served up to a backdrop of the Beatles, while in El Celler de Can Roca in Girona, Spain, scented meringue comes with a commentary describing Barcelona footballer Lionel Messi in action, a clip which apparently brings out the citrus flavours in the dessert. The so-called digital seasoning also applies to wine, helping drinkers to enjoy their tipple by up to 15 per cent more, if served alongside the right music. Researchers found people enjoyed their wine more while listening to 'paired' music, rather than while being sat in silence. Tchaikovsky's String Quartet No 1 in D Major particularly compliments Chateau Margaux 2004, while Mozart's Flute Quartet in D Major should be played while drinking Puilly-Fume. Professor Charles Spence, a behavioral psychologist from Oxford University, told the Observer's Neil Tweedle that taste is not as dominant as we might think in judging a meal and that our ears might subconsciously talk to our tastebuds. He said: 'Music cannot create taste or flavours that are not there in your mouth, but it can draw attention to certain notes in a wine or food that are competing in your mind... It's kind of digital seasoning.' The deep tones of Luciano Pavarotti (pictured left) singing Nessun Dorma can enhance the bitterness in coffee and the intensity in a chocolate mousse (pictured right) Mr Spence added that humans tend to match the same sounds to the same tastes. He described sourness as 'high-pitched', meaning it should be played alongside music of the same quality. He also said sweetness is associated with richer sounds, while bitterness is linked to deeper tones. He believes the sound associated with salty - which he has not yet pinned down - would be enhanced by a throbbing type of sound. 'Bitter, sweet, sour - we have those,' says Professor Charles Spence, 'But salty is the hardest taste to embody in sound.' To carry out his research, Mr Spence gives people two pieces of identical chocolate and asks them to each eat one while listening to a different piece of classical music. While the more sombre music is played, people generally describe the chocolate as more bitter. When they described the chocolate as 'sweet', it generally when the more upbeat piece was being played, he said. Heston Blumenthal, who runs the Fat Duck in Bray, Berkshire, is among restaurateurs who have sought the professor's advice. Mr Spence said that, as well as music, colour and even the weight of cutlery are factors which can combine to make a dining experience more enjoyable. Ambient lighting was found to have a positive effect on a person's enjoyment, with red light bringing out the fruitiness in red wine.","Research suggests certain types of music can bring out specific flavours .

"Greece has denied it will fail to pay a multi-million pound loan following reports it has drawn up plans to introduce parallel drachma currency to pay domestic bills. The country is due to repay a £330million loan to the International Monetary Fund on Thursday but there were concerns the heavily indebted nation would default on the payment.

He said: 'We strive to be able to pay our obligations on time. We are ready to pay on April 9.' Sources close to the ruling Syriza party claimed the government was prioritising paying wages and pensions over any loans due, according to the Telegraph. It  reported that the nation no longer has the funds to repay the debt unless the eurozone agrees to pay the next portion of its interim bail-out deal in time. A senior official told the newspaper: 'We are a Left-wing government. If we have to choose between a default to the IMF or a default to our own people, it is a no-brainer. 'We may have to go into a silent arrears process with the IMF. This will cause a furore in the markets and means that the clock will start to tick much faster.'

"(CNN)Roseanne Barr revealed earlier this week that she is going blind. In an interview with The Daily Beast, the 62-year-old comic talked about her struggle with macular degeneration and glaucoma — two eye diseases that get progressively worse over time and can steal vision. Barr's doctors haven't provided a timeline, but her symptoms are worsening: ""My vision is closing in now,"" she said. ""I just try and enjoy vision as much as possible. Y'know, living it up."" Related: 9 worst eye care mistakes you're making . Macular degeneration is a breakdown of the part of the retina that allows us to see fine details in the center of vision; while glaucoma damages the nerve that connects the retina to the brain, and is often caused by fluid build-up and pressure in the eyes. (Barr said in the interview that she helps relieve the pressure by using marijuana, which is known to temporarily lower pressure inside the eye.) ""It's somewhat unusual that Roseanne Bar has both, but not unheard of,"" explains ophthalmologist Steven A. Shanbom, MD, of Shanbom Eye Specialists in Berkley, Mich. Though there are some controllable risk factors, certain people are genetically predisposed to these diseases, so Barr may simply be prone to both. ""Certainly it's sad. The combination of the two is terrible. Macular degeneration takes away her central vision, and glaucoma is taking away her peripheral vision,"" Dr. Shanbom adds. (He is not treating Roseanne Barr, and does not know the specifics of her case.) The risk for both diseases goes up for everyone after age 60, with some people, especially African Americans, at higher risk in their 40s. That's why the American Academy of Opthalmology recommends getting a baseline eye exam when you turn the big 4-0, even if you have perfect vision. In the early stages, you can have either condition, but have no symptoms at all. Things like a family history or high blood pressure, or issues within the eye (like having a thinner cornea, for example) might lead your MD to prescribe drops that can reduce your chances of developing glaucoma by about half. Related: 10 natural ways to lower blood pressure . There is no cure for either disease. But like those eyedrops, there are treatments that may delay the progression of early-stage glaucoma (from other drugs to surgery), and therapies that might halt further vision loss in advanced cases of macular degeneration (including an implantable telescope). The future looks brighter however: An animal study published this month suggests that an injection of stem cells into the eye might slow or even reverse the effects of early-stage macular degeneration. There are also simple things you can start doing right now to ward off these diseases. Here, five ways to protect your peepers. Slip on your shades—even when it's cloudy . Sun exposure can up the risk for glaucoma and macular degeneration, as well as cataracts (clouding of the lenses). Make sure your sunglasses offer 99% to 100% UV protection. Sporting a pair that doesn't filter UV light is more dangerous than wearing no shades at all, because the dark lenses cause your pupils to dilate and allow in more harmful rays. Schedule in a regular walk . Studies indicate that aerobic exercise can reduce the eye pressure that leads to glaucoma, and may improve blood flow to the retina and optic nerve. According to the Glaucoma Research Foundation, all you need to do is raise your pulse 20% to 25% (which could mean a brisk walk) for 20 minutes, a minimum of four times a week. Related: 9 tweaks that make walking workouts more effective . Eat your greens . Spinach, kale, and other leafy greens are packed with lutein and zeaxanthin—antioxidants that lower your risk of developing macular degeneration (and cataracts too), research shows. Another good source: egg yolks. Snack on almonds, citrus, and berries . Almonds are loaded with vitamin E (a handful provides about half your daily dose), which slows macular degeneration; while citrus fruit and berries are filled with vitamin C, which cuts your odds of developing the disease. Avoid cigarette smoke . While smoking is bad news for many parts of your body, you may not have considered eyes to be one of them. However, smoking doubles your risk of macular degeneration. Avoiding cigs can not only protect your lungs and heart, it can protect your peepers too.","Barr has macular degeneration and glaucoma, eye diseases that get progressively worse and can steal vision .

"Landlord: Despite attacking right to buy, Emily Thornberry has three homes . A senior Labour politician was under fire last night for attacking right to buy – while renting out a property she bought from a housing association. Emily Thornberry has come out against David Cameron’s pledge to extend the right to buy policy from council tenants to those in housing association homes. But eight years ago she and her husband bought at auction a housing association property now worth almost £1million. Tories said Miss Thornberry, who lost her frontbench job after tweeting a sneering picture of a house covered in England flags and with a white van outside, opposed right to buy but not ‘right to buy to let’. ‘This hypocrisy goes right to the heart of Ed Miliband’s Islington-based, out-of-touch Labour Party,’ said Henry Smith, who is seeking re-election as Conservative MP for Crawley. ‘They speak out against plans that help the aspirations of hardworking people on days when it’s politically useful.’ Housing association chiefs have also been accused of hypocrisy for drawing huge salaries and living in mansions while wishing to deny tenants a foot on the property ladder. Ruth Davison, of the National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, has a£1million home in fashionable Islington, north London. Miss Thornberry yesterday retweeted an article from the federation attacking right to buy. And, in a question-and-answer session last week, the Labour candidate for Islington South and Finsbury criticised the policy directly. She said: ‘I don’t have a problem per se with people being able to buy their council flat or council house, so long as it is replaced like for like. 'And that’s what the problem has been. There has been a massive sell-off but they have not been replaced.’ Council house tenants in England can already buy their home at a discount of up to £103,900. The Tories would extend this to 800,000 housing association tenants who now have limited purchase rights and to 500,000 who have no rights at all. Around 2.7million people live in these properties. The subsidies would be funded by making councils sell their more costly properties when they become vacant. Each would be replaced on a one-for-one basis. The picture that cost Miss Thornberry her job as shadow attorney general was taken during the Rochester by-election, which was won by Ukip. The case highlighted just how much high-value property Miss Thornberry owned. Costly tweet: Emily Thornberry lost her frontbench job after tweeting this picture, with the sneering caption 'Image from #Rochester' while on the campaign trail in Medway, Kent . She lives with her husband, high court judge Sir Christopher Nugee, in a four-storey Victorian townhouse on an exclusive crescent in Barnsbury, north London, worth almost £3million. Emily Thornberry was forced to resign from the shadow cabinet in November after sneering at a home with St George’s flags hung outside and a white van on the drive. She said she had ‘never seen anything like it’ after tweeting a photo of the terraced home while on the campaign trail for the Rochester and Strood by-election in Kent. The then-shadow attorney general, who lives in a £3million north London house, wrote mockingly alongside the photo: ‘Image from Rochester.’ At first she tried to defend her remarks but was told to quit within hours of the tweet. The home’s owner, cage fighter Dan Ware, 37, branded her a ‘snob’. Speaking at the time, leader Ed Miliband said: ‘Respect is a basic rule of politics and I’m afraid her tweet conveyed a sense of disrespect.’ Miss Thornberry also owns a £600,000 flat in Guildford, Surrey, which she bought for her mother in 2000. In March 2007, her husband bought the housing association property in Finsbury at auction for £572,000. The three-storey townhouse was bought from Ujima, a housing association catering largely for ethnic minority tenants, which went bust just months later. It is now let. The fact a housing association sells a property does not necessarily mean social housing stock has fallen. They could use the cash to build in a cheaper area. During part of her childhood, Miss Thornberry lived in a council house. At the age of seven, her parents divorced and she and her two younger brothers moved into social housing with their mother. Labour politicians continued to attack the right to buy extension yesterday. David Lammy, a potential London mayoral candidate, tweeted: ‘Extending right to buy is one of the most senseless and irresponsible pledges ever made by a British political party.’ Last night a YouGov poll for the Policy Exchange think-tank suggested 50 per cent back extended right to buy. Housing fat cat who hates right to buy is a Labour supporter with £1m home . Hypocrite? Ruth Davison, leading critic of David Cameron's plan to extent the right to buy scheme is a Labour party member and the owner of a £1million house in Islington, London . The leading critic of Conservative Party plans to give housing association tenants a right to buy herself lives in a £1million house. As director of policy and external affairs at the National Housing Federation, Ruth Davison has been leading the campaign to prevent millions of people getting a real chance of owning their own homes. But just as she did not advertise the fact that she is a member of her local Labour party in Islington, North London, neither has she revealed just how comfortable her own house is. In reality she has been one of the country’s biggest gainers from the private property boom. She also earned hefty salaries in public bodies for years when Labour was in power. Miss Davison, 44, and husband Chris Bailey, 47, who describes himself as an ‘urban regenerator, non-profit board member and social entrepreneur’, bought a large terrace house in Islington for £440,000 ten years ago. It has now rocketed to more than £1million in value. Yet on behalf of the fat-cat housing association bosses she speaks for, Miss Davison has been across the newspapers and broadcasters this week fighting to stop the Conservative election campaign proposal to extend ‘right to buy’ legislation from council house tenants to the 2.7million people living in housing association properties. Under the scheme, housing association tenants would receive discounts of tens of thousands of pounds on the market value of their homes. Miss Davison told the BBC in response to the Tory right-to-buy plans on Tuesday that it was wrong to effectively give money to ‘some of the most securely housed people in the country on some of the lowest rents’. She added: ‘We are independent organisations and charities – you can no more force a housing association to sell their assets at less than they’re worth than you can force Tesco, or even Cancer Research. So housing associations would have to be fully recompensed for any sale. There will be a cost to the taxpayer.’ Miss Davison’s first major taxpayer-funded role under Labour was at the Audit Commission, with other senior roles at Bedford and Hertfordshire Strategic Health Authority and the National Patient Safety Agency. Last night Miss Davison said: ‘The price of a family house is now beyond the reach of many – I couldn’t afford to buy my home now. ‘We need to build more homes of all types to make housing more affordable for everyone, not just give money away to the lucky few.’","Emily Thornberry has criticised Conservative 'right-to-buy' policy .

The federal government will give Shoshana Hebshi $40,000 as compensation for being humiliated on the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks after armed agents forced her from a plane at Detroit Metropolitan Airport, made her undress during a search and held her for hours. Frontier Airlines, the Transportation Security Administration and Wayne County Airport Authority were named in the federal lawsuit. Won her case: Shoshana Hebshi, of Sylvania, Ohio, who was strip-searched at a Detroit-area airport, will gain $40,000 as compensation for being humiliated . Yoga instructor: Hebshi works as a freelance writer, yoga instructor, and is a mother to two twins . Hebshi, who has a Jewish mother and Saudi Arabian father, has said she was ethnically profiled based on her dark complexion. 'I filed this lawsuit because I didn't want others to experience the kind of unnecessary trauma that I did, and it has given me faith that the justice system can work to protect constitutional rights,' Hebshi said in a release. 'This settlement gives me some peace of mind. Now, I feel like I can finally put the incident behind me.' Hebshi of Sylvania, Ohio, was traveling home after visiting a sister in California when was removed from the Frontier Airlines flight after it landed Sept. 11, 2011. She was seated next to two Indian-American men, whom crew members had said spent a lot of time in the plane's bathroom. All three were detained, according to the ACLU. Hebshi was held for hours before being released. The two men also were released. 'People do not forfeit their constitutional rights when they step onto an airplane,' said ACLU attorney Rachel Goodman.

Ethnically profiled: Shoshana Hebshi, a woman of Arab and Jewish descent was strip-searched at Detroit Metropolitan Airport on the 10th anniversary on 9/11 . 'This settlement sends that critical message, and will help protect future passengers from having to endure what Shoshana went through.' The Airport Authority said its insurer agreed to a financial settlement to avoid 'further time-consuming and costly litigation.' That amount was not released. Airport police 'acted quickly and responsibly, and followed appropriate protocols in responding to a request for help from one of our airline partners,' Authority Chief Executive Thomas Naughton said in a release. 'I strongly support their actions. We remain committed to vigilantly protecting the safety of the travelling public.' As part of the settlement, Frontier will amend its employee handbook to more clearly state its zero-tolerance policy on discrimination and provide all new employees with training on that revision. The airline also will amend its customer complaint policy to ensure allegations of discrimination are given appropriate attention. Frontier Airlines declined to comment on the settlement. According to Hebshi's Twiiter, she is a mother of twin boys and works as a yoga instructor and freelance writer.

"(CNN)One war was enough for Gregory Margolin. Now 87 years old, he was a 16-year-old Jewish recruit when he fought in the Soviet Red Army. As he fought the Nazis in World War II, his family fled. ""I did not show that I was Jewish,"" Margolin says. ""But it did not matter because people were being killed left and right. All around me."" This year, in Ukraine, he found himself again surrounded by war. Margolin was a sniper who rose to be a commander in the army. His old uniform is still adorned with medals from his time in the military. His granddaughter Liora still marvels at his stories from the war. She is amazed that he managed to survive. Suffering from Alzheimer's disease, a degenerative condition that impairs memory, he struggles to remember his own life sometimes, but he remembers the horrors of war. His eyes slowly shift back and forth as he seeks the right word. Or perhaps the right memory. His hands shake ever so slightly. It seems he knows he has lived a life. He is just trying to remember all the details. ""People were hiding in shelters under the ground,"" Liora says of the stories Margolin once told. ""They were being shot at point blank range. It was terrible."" ""[The Nazis] would have erased us from the Earth,"" Margolin remembers. ""They attacked us and we fought back."" After the war, Margolin settled in Donetsk in Eastern Ukraine. His family grew. He built a life. Then, decades later, he found himself in the middle of a war once again. ""A missile fell and the house was destroyed. We were attacked,"" Margolin says. ""A missile fell. I remember."" Margolin's family lived in a neighborhood next to the Donetsk airport, near some of the most intense fighting in Eastern Ukraine as pro-Russian separatists battled the Ukrainian army. Margolin, who had survived one war, was able to survive another, even as the stray missile hit his house on February 10. It spared him, but it killed his daughter Ira. ""The moment it happened, we decided that's it. Here and now, we're moving to Israel,"" says Liora. ""This is the safest place."" Margolin arrived in Israel on March 24. Asked why the family waited to leave the war-torn region of Eastern Ukraine, Liora says they felt they would be fine in Donetsk, while Liora prayed for their safety from Israel. ""No matter how much we're afraid of the next war here and as much as it's not quiet here, it is the quietest place."" Margolin came over in a wave of Ukrainian Jewish immigration to Israel that coincided with the beginning of hostilities in Eastern Ukraine. The International Fellowship of Christians and Jews, an organization that works to build interfaith understanding and support for Israel, has brought 600 Jews to Israel since December, Margolin among them. Rabbi Yechiel Eckstein, the fellowship's founder, says, ""We set up a refugee center. It's the first time since the Holocaust that the Jewish world has had to set up a refugee center for these Jews who are fleeing and have nowhere to go."" Among the Ukrainian Jews moving to Israel, Eckstein says they have worked with approximately a dozen Holocaust survivors. On Yom HaShoah, Israel's Holocaust Remembrance Day that commemorates the Nazi extermination of 6 million Jews, these stories of survival reverberate with a renewed energy. Jews who struggled to survive once find themselves fleeing to survive now. ""Most of the [Jewish] people in the Ukraine are Holocaust survivors or children of Holocaust survivors. These are the people who made it, who are able to flee or come back or to stay or to somehow survive the Holocaust."" Margolin was one of these people, able to survive the Holocaust as a soldier in the Soviet Army. His story can be difficult for him to remember sometimes, but it is impossible for his family to forget.

"Britain was hailed as a ‘job-creating machine’ last night as the number of people in work soared to its highest level in history. The Conservatives’ economic strategy also won a stunning international endorsement, with the International Monetary Fund lavishing praise on Chancellor George Osborne. Employment rose above 31million in the three months to February, official figures showed – 557,000 higher than a year before. The Conservatives’ economic strategy  won a stunning international endorsement, with the International Monetary Fund lavishing praise on Chancellor George Osborne (pictured) David Cameron said the Conservatives had overseen a ‘jobs miracle’ and Britain had created more jobs in the last five years than the rest of the EU put together. ‘There are now two million more people in work than in 2010,’ the Prime Minister said. The encouraging numbers came as Rolls-Royce announced its biggest-ever order, worth more than £6billion, to power passenger jets for the Middle Eastern airline Emirates. IMF chief Christine Lagarde and German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble praised Mr Osborne’s ‘wonderful job’ of handling the economy. In a blow to Labour, which has opposed most of the Government’s austerity measures, Mrs Lagarde said the Government had provided the ‘right balance’ of spending cuts and tax rises. The plan had reduced the deficit from a record £153billion under Labour in 2009-10 to £90billion last year. She said she had ‘no doubt that can continue to be the case in the future’ under Mr Osborne’s plans to return Britain to the black in 2018-19, a pledge Labour has failed to match. David Cameron said the Conservatives had overseen a ‘jobs miracle’ and Britain had created more jobs in the last five years than the rest of the EU put together . ‘The fiscal deficit has been significantly reduced over the last few years,’ said Mrs Lagarde. ‘Added to that it is clearly also delivering results. It is obvious that what is happening in the UK has actually worked.’ Mr Schaeuble said he was ‘full of respect’ for what the Chancellor has achieved and delivered what amounted to a highly unusual endorsement of the Tories. ‘The UK and the UK economy has done a wonderful job in the last couple of years,’ he said. ‘The UK and George Osborne has a very good plan for the future. I am very much in favour of what has been achieved and what has been forecast.’ The Chancellor, speaking at the spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank in Washington, said the UK ‘is one of the brightest spots in the world economy at the moment’. ‘I am here representing the UK with an economy that is firmly on course – the deficit halved as a share of GDP, strong growth, record high employment, record low inflation,’ he said. Greece poses the biggest threat to the global economy and the deepening crisis could hit Britain, George Osborne warned yesterday. Fears are mounting that the recession-battered country will default on its debts and be forced to leave the eurozone, creating an economic and political earthquake. The Chancellor (pictured with IMF managing director Christine Lagarde) said the crisis in Greece had made the mood at International Monetary Fund talks in Washington this week ‘notably more gloomy’ The Chancellor said the crisis in Greece had made the mood at International Monetary Fund talks in Washington this week ‘notably more gloomy’. Mr Osborne added: ‘It is clear that a misstep or miscalculation on either side [in Greece] could easily return European economies to the type of perilous situation we saw three to four years ago. ‘It would be a mistake to think that the UK could be immune to a return to this instability in European financial systems and the European economy.’ ‘The British economy is a job-creating machine and we have set out, as a Conservative Party, plans to go on creating jobs, two million further jobs, in the next parliament.’ Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander hailed Britain as the ‘job-creation powerhouse of the western economies’. The Rolls-Royce deal means the Derby-based firm will make the engines for 50 of Emirates’ Airbus A380 planes from its UK factories, where it employs 24,500 people. Emirates’ use of the A380 is said to have created 7,000 UK jobs. Rolls-Royce has worked with Emirates since 1996 but this is the first time it has made engines for the Gulf carrier’s super-jumbo fleet. Labour was forced to welcome the latest employment figures, but Ed Miliband insisted that ‘too often jobs in our country are low-paid, low-skilled and insecure’. ‘It is not just about zero-hours contracts. Young people have done badly, with growing debt, an insecure job and owning a home a distant dream,’ he said. Ed Miliband (pictured) has insisted that ‘too often jobs in our country are low-paid, low-skilled and insecure’ But John Philpott, director of the Jobs Economist website, said two-thirds of the new jobs were full-time and ‘almost all’ were permanent. In more good news, yesterday’s figures showed the unemployment rate has also fallen to pre-crisis levels of 5.6 per cent. It was last this low in June 2008. Wages excluding bonuses are also rising at 1.8 per cent – the highest level since 2012, the Office for National Statistics revealed. This wage increase will feel even higher for workers because the inflation rate is zero.","Employment in UK rose above 31million in last three months to February .

"The British Veterinary Association has withdrawn its support for the shooting of free-running badgers in controversial pilot culls. The two four-year pilot culls in Somerset and Gloucestershire should be completed by trapping the badgers in cages and then shooting them, says the BVA. It concluded that the first two years of culling had not demonstrated conclusively that ‘controlled shooting’ of free-running badgers could be effective and humane. The two four-year pilot culls in Somerset and Gloucestershire should be completed by trapping the badgers in cages and then shooting them, says the BVA . The BVA said it still supported badger culling to tackle tuberculosis in cattle. Animal welfare campaigners welcomed the news but said the BVA’s ongoing support for cage-trapping and shooting was ‘regrettable’. It comes after the Environment Secretary promised to roll out more culls across the country if the Tories win the election. Addressing the National Farmers Union conference in February, Liz Truss said 'any future Conservative government' would push ahead with 'a wider roll-out of the culls', which have been fiercely criticised by wildlife groups. Her comments came as NFU president Meurig Raymond said the incidence of TB had decreased on farms in two pilot areas in Somerset and Gloucestershire where culling of badgers has taken place over the last two years. The Environment Secretary promised to roll out more culls across the country if the Tories win the election . He urged politicians not to make the controversial cull 'a party political issue' in the run-up to the general election, and criticised Labour for pledging to give up on culling. Ms Truss pledged that any future Conservative government would 'take the difficult decisions to deal with this disease'. She told the conference: 'It is shameful that under the previous government bovine TB increased nine-fold and we ended up with the highest levels of the disease in Europe. 'It is incredible that they would like to make the same mistake again.' She said the Government's strategy included cattle movement controls, vaccination in 'edge' areas around disease hotspots, and culling where the disease is rife. 'We will not let up, whatever complaints we get from protest groups. We're in it for the long haul. We will not walk away,' she said to the conference, to applause from farmers. In Gloucestershire just 274 badgers were culled in the second year of the pilot, falling far short of the minimum 615 estimated to be needed to deliver reductions in TB in livestock, leading the chief vet to admit the benefits of the cull might not be realised there. The Government claimed the low numbers in Gloucestershire reflected the 'challenges of extensive unlawful protest and intimidation' by anti-cull campaigners. In Somerset, where the other pilot cull has been carried out, a sufficient number of badgers were killed this year to lead to expected reductions in TB in cattle, with 341 culled, in a required range of 316 to 785.","British Veterinary Association has withdrawn its support of pilot culls .

"Koby Hodder, suffered a cardiac arrest and collapsed in the school playground when he was 10 . A 10-year-old boy nearly died after suffering a cardiac arrest in the school playground. Koby Hodder's heart stopped for a staggering 12 minutes after he collapsed while running around with friends during the morning break. He was playing British Bulldog – a game in which children run from one side of a playing field to another without being caught by one of the ‘bulldogs’, who often employ forceful tactics to trap runners, including rugby tackling opponents to the ground. Teachers across the country have called for the game to be banned, claiming it is dangerous and leads to children becoming injured. In the middle of playing the game, Koby suffered a cardiac arrest. This is where the electrical activity of the heart becomes so chaotic that it stops pumping and quivers or ‘fibrillates’ instead. His heart suddenly stopped beating blood around his body and he collapsed and lost consciousness. The 10-year-old was later diagnosed with the same heart condition as footballer Fabrice Muamba, a former Bolton Wanderers  player who collapsed after suffering a cardiac arrest during the first half of Bolton's FA Cup quarter-final against Tottenham in 2012. Mr Muamba was 'effectively dead' for 78 minutes and had to be shocked 15 times before his heart restarted. Teachers at Koby’s school in Doncaster, were able to give Koby CPR until paramedics arrived and saved his life. His father, Mark, 45, got a call from the school at around 11am on March 2, and was told to get to the school immediately. He said: 'I was working around the corner so I was able to get straight over there and when I saw Koby on the ground I knew he was dead. 'Teachers were giving him CPR but I could see he was grey and lifeless. I couldn't even go to him. I was devastated.' Luckily he was brought back to life when paramedics Lee Murphy and Martin Parkinson and emergency care assistant Freddie Stevens arrived, and were able to save him by giving Koby two shocks with a defibrillator. A cardiac arrest happens when the heart stops pumping blood around your body. The most common cause of a cardiac arrest is a life threatening abnormal heart rhythm called ventricular fibrillation (VF). Ventricular fibrillation happens when the electrical activity of your heart becomes so chaotic that the heart stops pumping and quivers or 'fibrillates' instead. Someone who is having a cardiac arrest will suddenly lose consciousness and will stop breathing or stop breathing normally. Unless immediately treated by CPR this always leads to death within minutes. It is possible to survive and recover from a cardiac arrest, with the right treatment. Ventrivular fibrillation - which causes an arrest - can sometimes be corrected by giving an electric shock through the chest wall, by using a device called a defibrillator. Source: British Heart Foundation . Koby, who turned 11 two weeks ago, was rushed to Doncaster Royal Infirmary, where he seemed to be making a recovery. Just as he seemed to be improving, he suffered another attack, and was transferred to Leeds General Infirmary Paediatric Intensive Care Unit. Mr Hodder, a builder and father-of-three, said: 'We were beside ourselves with worry. 'Koby is super-fit, he plays football three times a week and goes boxing two times a week. ‘How could this happen in someone so young?’ Koby’s mother, Joanne Hodder, 43, added: 'Can you imagine what we were going through? 'We didn't even have a clue what had happened to Koby. ‘We didn't think for a moment that he could have had a heart problem. 'I had dropped him off to school that morning and he was his happy little self. ‘We had no warning. Koby is a bit of a joker so when he collapsed even his friends thought he was messing around, until they noticed he wasn't breathing.' While Koby was in hospital doctors fitted him with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) to shock his heart back into rhythm should it ever stop again. Muamba, 26, was fitted with the same implant after his high profile collapse three years ago. Mr Hodder said: 'At the moment we don't know what has caused Koby to have a heart problem. It is baffling.' Koby, who is now 11, suffered a series of cardiac arrests, where the heart suddenly stops pumping blood around the body, and was treated in intensive care . Koby had a device fitted to his heart which will shock it back into beating if it ever stops again. He is pictured in hospital with boxer Josh Warrington . Mr and Mrs Hodder are due to have tests to see if Koby's heart condition is hereditary. His brother and sister, Joel, 27, and Courteney, 20, may also have to be tested. Mrs Hodder, said: 'I cannot thank each and every person who played a part in saving Koby's life and helped with his recovery, enough. 'Teachers, paramedics and hospital staff have all been amazing. 'As a parent it is your worst nightmare to receive a phone call like I did from school, when you sent your healthy 10-year-old child there fit and well that morning. 'Doctors have said that the fact that Koby was running around at the time of the attack may have helped him - because it meant his heart was pumping.' Koby knows he is lucky to be alive, but his dream of being a professional footballer has been taken from him. Koby had played with both Leeds United and Doncaster Rovers youth teams and dreamed of playing for his beloved Leeds United when he got older. Mr Hodder said: 'Doctors have said he can play with friends as long as he doesn't exert himself too much. ‘They've said that if he can exercise and talk at the same time then that's okay, but playing professionally is out of the question. Koby suffered from the same heart condition as Fabrice Muamba, a Bolton Wanderers football player who collapsed after a cardiac arrest during the first half of Bolton's FA Cup quarter-final against Tottenham . 'Maybe Koby would not have been a professional footballer but he is gutted, understandably.' Mrs Hodder said: 'When Koby feels down we tell him that he is very lucky to be here and that makes him feel better. 'But he is still recovering and sometimes he feels scared, but he is still getting used to his defibrillator. It's a big thing he has had to deal with. 'For his birthday he didn't want a sleepover as we had originally planned, instead we went for a day out to York. 'Koby has come a long way and even returned to school this month. 'He's had a fantastic recovery so far, which is all down to the fast response from the school staff and the paramedics. 'He's doing better than we could have ever imagined. I am so grateful we still have our little boy with us.'

"A pair of British expats say they are ‘trapped’ in southern Spain amid an ongoing legal battle with the local town hall over a luxury bed and breakfast they once operated. Patrick and Valerie Jubb are attempting to sell the four-bedroom property where they currently reside in Jimena de la Frontera, but it is now on the brink of being torn down. The retired couple told Spain’s Olive Press news website that they have done nothing wrong but face losing the estate over illegal additions made by a previous owner. Patrick and Valerie Jubb are locked in a dispute with the town hall over alterations made by a previous owner . The Jubbs purchased the bed and breakfast in Jimena de la Frontera, in southern Spain, in 2008 . Patrick, 64, told the news website: ‘We are in absolute pieces over this. ‘All we want is to go back to the UK to be with our family and friends, but we can’t. All our money is tied up in the property.’ Patrick, a former engineer from London, and his 63-year-old wife, Valerie, bought the bed and breakfast, La Vina de Linan, in 2008 and closed it a year ago as they moved forward with plans to sell it. They said they had a deal in place to sell the estate for €680,000, but the town hall ruled that the first floor, kitchen and pool were illegally built by previous owners in 1994. The Jubbs said they obtained a certificate that stated there were no infractions when they bought the estate . When the Jubbs tried to sell the town hall ruled that the alterations, including a swimming pool, were illegal . The Jubbs told the Olive Press that the Junta provided a certificate stating there were no planning infractions when they bought the property, and that the alterations were legalised by land registry officials in 2005 – three years before they acquired the estate. In most situations the local authority loses the right to demolish a house that has been illegally altered if it fails to detect the alterations within four years. But in the case of the Jubbs the usual rule does not apply because the property is located inside Los Alcornocales Natural Park in the Andalusian province of Cadiz. Patrick and Valerie Jubb are planning to move back to the UK, but said their money is tied up in the property . Patrick said the alterations never should have been approved in the first place. Online adverts still list the Jubbs’ property for sale, with a guide price of €875,000. With a sparkling rating on TripAdvisor, it is marketed as a secluded and private property with panoramic mountain views. It is located just 25 minutes from Gibraltar and 90 minutes from Malaga airport. The home boasts four en-suite bedrooms, a large sitting room with a fireplace, a dining room and terraces.","Patrick and Valerie Jubb purchased the property in Andalusia in 2008 .

"A 3-year-old's recurring nightmare about a mysterious white van may help shed light on what really happened the day her mother died in an SUV crash that Virginia police have ruled a tragic accident. Natali Castellanos-Tyler, 30, a married mother of three from Chesterfield County, was returning home from a birthday party February 21 with her daughter, Elisa, in the backseat when she supposedly slid off a rain-soaked road, slammed her silver Ford Explorer into a tree and died at the scene. Investigators concluded that the crash was a one-car collision that was caused by poor road conditions. Scroll down for video . Loss: Natali Castellanos-Tyler, 30, pictured with her husband, Craig, and their two children, was killed in an SUV crash in Virginia two months ago to the day . Deadly impact: Castellanos-Tyler was just a few miles from her home when her 2002 Ford Explorer ran off the road in the 15400 block of Genito Road and careened into a tree . Accident: Police said the crash was a one-car collision caused by a rain-soaked road . Elisa Tyler emerged from the accident largely unscathed, but according to her father, Craig Tyler, the little girl has been plagued by disturbing nightmares and daytime visions about the accident. 'She’ll just start walking and she’ll start screaming, ""The van, the white van!”' the young widower told CBS6. 'I’ll say, ""What happened with the white van?"" And she says, ""It hurt me — it hurt my car!”' Tyler, who is now raising his their children, ages 9, 3 and 1, on his own after his wife's passing, at first did not know what to make of Elisa's night terrors. But then this past weekend he came across several Facebook posts from nearby communities of Foxcroft and Magnolia Green about a series of hit-and-run accidents involving a white box truck. One Facebook user, 17-year-old Caitlyn Thomas, claimed she was side-swiped by a white delivery-style truck on Otterdale Road March 30; the impact of the collision reportedly sent a piece of her side-view mirror crashing through the driver's window. Doubt: Little Elisa, pictured left with her parents and baby brother, and right with her mom, has been having nightmares and daytime visions about a white van, which her father believes may have something to do with the crash . Widower: Craig Tyler says the toddler, pictured above, has told him that the white van in her dreams 'hurt' her and her car . Sightings: A plain white delivery-style box truck, possibly similar to the one pictured above, has been linked to no fewer than three hit-and-run incidents in which two cars and a school bus were side-swiped . According to an eyewitness, the driver of the truck briefly slowed down and turned his head back to look at Thomas' damaged car, but then took off from the scene without waiting for police to arrive. A day earlier, Subastree Thompson said she was also side-swiped by a white box truck on the same road. According to the woman, who was driving with her 3-year-old in the backseat, the white van was carrying two or three men sitting in a single row. The van slowed down for a moment but then sped off before Thompson had a chance to take down its license plate number. Then on April 3, a plain white van matching the same description as in the two earlier incidents allegedly side-swiped a school bus filled with students from Cosby High School. Chesterfield County Police said they were investigating a possible connection between the crashes, but a spokesperson for the department said there was no evidence in Castellano-Tyler's collision to suggest the involvement of another vehicle. Dashing duo: Natali, a native of El Salvador, and Craig met by chance at a restaurant several years ago and married in a courthouse in 2013 . The 30-year-old leaves behind three children, including a 9-year-old boy from a previous relationship in El Salvador and her and Craig's two kids, ages 1 and 3 . Tragic twist: The couple had been planning to have a formal wedding ceremony this coming July and Natali had picked out an ivory lace dress (pictured) for the big day. Instead, she was laid to rest in her dream gown . The woman was just a few miles from her home when at 2pm her 2002 Ford Explorer ran off the road in the 15400 block of Genito Road and careened into a tree, reported the station WRIC. Paramedics arrived on the scene but it was too late for the mother. Her daughter Elisa was taken to a hospital with minor scrapes and bruises. On Monday, nearly two months to the day after the crash, Natali’s husband, Craig, wrote on his Facebook page that he was praying ‘for the truth to be revealed.’ He and Natali, a native of El Salvador, met years earlier at a local restaurant and married with little fanfare in a courthouse on June 21, 2012. The couple had been planning to have a formal wedding ceremony this coming July, followed by a long-awaited honeymoon. Natali had an ivory lace gown picked out for the big day, but instead of wearing it to go down the aisle, she was laid to rest in her dream dress February 27 in the presence of her heartbroken family. A GoFundMe account has been set up to help cover some of the Tyler family's living expenses. So far, more than $15,440 has been raised.","Natali Castellanos-Tyler, 30, married mother of three from Virginia, was killed when she crashed into tree February 21 .

"A Canadian man found a novel way to take in the sights while travelling across country, by taking an rocking chair with him. Kalman Kallai enjoyed the spectacular Canadian scenery from the comfort of a green chair while journeying from Borden, Ontario to Comox, British Columbia for work purposes. Calculating that the drive would take him across a colossal 2,796 miles (4500km) of land, Mr Kallai believed that his journey would be more interesting if he used it as an opportunity to see more of his country. The traveller sits before corn, a café, boats and water, before he is featured rocking and making gestures with his hand . Mr Kallai and a friend mimic the planes that fly past at the beginning of the traveller's adventure . After picking up a green rocking chair that he acquired for free from online advertisement site Kijiji, the traveller attached his trailer and set off on the nine-day journey. The video begins with Mr Kallai carrying his chair to a wooded area, before placing it down and taking a seat. He wears a green hoody, blue jacket and hat – clothing items that remain a running theme throughout the course of the video. Mr Kallai travelled from Borden, Ontario to Comox, British Columbia for work purposes . Sat rocking on his chair watching a number of aeroplanes taking off – perhaps at this point wishing he was on one himself – the traveller is joined by a friend. The pair sit and mimic the plane’s wings before shaking hands and waving goodbye to one another, to allow Mr Kallai to continue his adventure on his own. The traveller is then sat before corn, a café, boats and water, before he is featured rocking and making gestures with his hands. The traveller wears a green hoody, blue jacket and hat in every clip of himself in the video . Mr Kallai takes time to pose precariously on a river bed while journeying across Canada . He momentarily leaves the chair to chase some birds on a beach before making his way through a field and waving at some cows. Later in the video the traveller is met by his dad, who humorously steals the rocking chair before he is swiftly removed. Continuing a good portion of the journey together, the pair dance and jump around in front of rapids and tease a number of large statues. Creature comfort! Mr Kallai makes a number of hand gestures in the video and even waves at cows . Despite hauling the rocking chair around in a trailer, the traveller is also featured carrying it on his head . Mr Kallai said: ‘I brought my dad with me for part of the trek. It was a great bonding experience, as we shared many laughs. ‘I heard some pretty interesting stories about his youth that I hadn't heard before, especially since my mother wasn't on the trip with us.’ The pair reach Manitoba together before they meet with some people and the traveller’s father leaves his son to journey on by himself. Mr Kallai is joined by his dad while journeying across the country and the pair jump around and dance together . The traveller said that he shared many laughs with his dad and that it was a great bonding experience .

"Wisconsin ended Kentucky's bid to become the first college basketball team to remain undefeated in nearly 40 years, beating the Wildcats 71-64 behind 20 points and 11 rebounds from Frank Kaminsky. Wisconsin will play Duke, an 81-61 winner over Michigan State in the earlier semi-final, at the Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis on Monday night. 'It gives us another 40 minutes, I know that,' said Wisconsin coach Bo Ryan, who leads the Badgers to their first final since 1941. Wisconsin celebrate a 71-64 victory over Kentucky in the semi-finals of the NCAA Tournament . Wisconsin players run onto the court in celebration as Kentucky's unbeaten season was brought to an end . Wisconsin moved through to the final with a tense victory over Kentucky at the Lucas Oil Stadium . And Kentucky has a long ride home, finishing the season at 38-1 - two wins short of becoming the first undefeated team in college basketball since the 1975-76 Indiana Hoosiers. Instead, these NBA-ready group of Wildcats join the star-studded 1991 UNLV team as the latest to take an undefeated record into the Final Four but lose in the semifinals. Trailing by four and gasping for breath after going 6 minutes without a bucket, the Badgers (36-3) responded with an 8-0 run to take a lead Kentucky couldn't overcome. Kaminsky and Bronson Koenig went 7 for 8 from the line over the last 24 seconds to seal the win. The 70,000-capacity Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, home of the Colts in the NFL, is hosting the Final Four . Wisconsin Badgers fans cheer on their team at the Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis . Kentucky's last, best chance came while trailing by three with 12 seconds left. But Karl-Anthony Towns received the ball in the post and got fouled. He made only one free throw, and from there, Wisconsin clinched it from the foul-line. Earlier Saturday, Justise Winslow scored 19 points and Jahlil Okafor added 18 to lead top-seeded Duke to an 81-61 victory over Michigan State on Saturday and a shot at its fifth national championship. Winslow, who played through some early foul trouble, had nine rebounds and was 5 for 7 from the field, while Okafor grabbed six rebounds and was 7 for 11 from the field. Duke celebrated reaching the final of the NCAA Tournament with a 81-61 win over Michigan State . Justise Winslow of the Duke Blue Devils goes up for a dunk in the semi-final in Indianapolis . Senior Quinn Cook had 17 points for the Blue Devils, who dominated the game except for the opening minutes when they trailed 14-6. Defensively, it was a team effort, just the way coach Mike Krzyzewski has stressed for his 35 seasons at Duke. What had been wide open 3-pointers early for Michigan State became contested shots and when the Blue Devils started getting up and on the Spartans, the points were suddenly tough to come by. Denzel Valentine finished with 22 points, which included hitting three quick 3-pointers in the first quarter to give the No.7 seed Michigan State an early lead. Trice scored 16 points and Branden Dawson added 12 for the Spartans.","Wisconsin beat Kentucky 71-64 at Lucas Oil Stadium in Final Four .

"A young woman has revealed details about her lengthy battle with a rare condition that left her unable to eat anything for a year and a half – despite the fact that she still felt desperately hungry. Kyli Wilfson, a self-confessed ‘food person’, was 26 when she first started experiencing agonizing pain – which made her feel like she had been ‘kicked in the abdomen' – whenever she ate, a symptom which doctors initially brushed off as being due to a mild pancreatic problem which would ‘resolve itself’ in a matter of days. Kyli, now 29, was eventually diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis, and the North Carolina resident found herself looking at a lifetime spent on a feeding tube, as the disease, which effects less than .01 per cent of people, would only get worse. Within months she had dropped to a startling 80lbs, she revealed to Cosmopolitan.com, and  had to postpone her wedding as she spent more and more time in hospitals. Mystery illness: Kyli Wolfson, pictured, had trouble getting a correct diagnosis when she woke up in excruciating pain in October 2012; her illness left her unable to eat for a year and a half . At first, doctors faced difficulties even diagnosing Kyli; though she'd had digestive problems for years, her rare disease wasn't initially considered. Instead, doctors at her local ER insisted that she had acute pancreatitis, a condition that commonly effects heavy drinkers. However, Kyli's pain continued to return every time she tried to eat anything — even soup — leading her to visit two more hospitals in search of a new diagnosis and a cure. 'It never even changed,' she said, explaining that when she tried to eat, it felt like she was burning on the inside. 'It was still ten-out-of-ten pain.' Three months after her first visit to the emergency room, she was finally diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis, a condition she had likely had since birth but was only found after doctors put a camera down her throat to her pancreas — a potentially life-threatening procedure that was only tried after all other options had been exhausted. Literally starving: Still maintaining an appetite but unable to eat without pain, Kyli was constantly hungry — leading her fiancé Dustin Wood to feel bad eating in front of her . Rapid weight loss: Kyli's weight, which is normally at around 110lbs, dropped to 80lbs when she was at her lightest . Sufferers of the illness, which is characterized by an inflammation of the pancreas, have to be fed through a feeding tube because the condition never improves, and eventually leads to permanent damage. Kyli spent a year and half abstaining from eating entirely, which was an incredibly trying ordeal for both her and her fiancé Dustin Wood. 'We're food people,' she said. 'We [love] to bake, order takeout. Now he felt bad eating in front of me.' Luckily, Kyli found a support group for people who have chronic pancreatitis on Facebook, some of whom said they found a way to eat: a risky surgical procedure to remove the pancreas, spleen, gallbladder, appendix, and duodenum, which allows the pancreas' cells to be transplanted into the liver, enabling it to function as a pancreas. So Kyli flew to a hospital in Minnesota that specializes in the 14-hour surgery, and scheduled her procedure for January 2014. Enduring love: Kyli's wedding to fiancé Dustin is back on, now scheduled three years after she first went to the emergency room with stomach pain . After her surgery, Kyli spent another two and a half weeks using a feeding tube before being told to try food again. 'I was excited, but nervous, since it had been so long since I'd eaten,' she said. 'Sure enough, I had chicken broth and juice and it didn't affect anything. It was amazing.' She soon began enjoying ice cream, lobster, and pizza, and was able to return to her normal weight of 110lbs. 'The number one thing that helped was the support group I joined and knowing other people going through it,' she said. 'They saved me and gave me hope.' Now feeling healthy and grateful for the transformative surgery, Kyli was able to reschedule her wedding to Dustin. She will walk down the aisle in October.","Kyli Wolfson, 29, felt severe pain whenever she ate thanks to the disorder, which developed in October 2012, when she was 26 .

"From the lack of sleep to breastfeeding, becoming a mother for the first time is no mean feat. One new mother decided to start a blog called Upfront Mama detailing the trials and tribulations of raising her little girl Poppy, 14 months, who, she says, is the best and most life changing thing that has ever happened to her. Like so many new mothers, Nicola Bonn, 34, from London was learning on the job and found the whole experience 'exciting yet utterly petrifying'. Scroll down for video . Nicola Bonn, 34, from London, started a candid blog called Upfront Mama detailing the trials and tribulations of raising her little girl Poppy, 14 months, and many of her posts have gone viral . She wanted to share all the things that she had learnt so that fellow mothers wouldn’t feel as 'clueless' as she did. One of her blog posts, Why We Need to Stop Justifying Ourselves, went viral - no doubt thanks to her candid account of bringing up a baby for the first time. Here, she shares it with FEMAIL... 'Since becoming a mama I’ve spent way too much time explaining myself and almost apologising for my decisions and I’ve decided that it has to stop. 'The problem is that when you have a baby, everyone has an opinion and they’re often not afraid to air it which can be quite overwhelming for a new mother who is less experienced than the 'advice giver' and is most probably filled with high levels of self doubt. Nicola, 34, wanted to share all the things that she had learnt so that fellow mothers wouldn’t feel as 'clueless' as she did, and admits that since becoming a mother, she's spent way too much time explaining herself and almost apologising for her decisions - and she's decided that it has to stop . She believes one of the main hurdles is that everyone has an opinion and they're often not afraid to air it, which. she says, can be quite overwhelming for a new mother who is less experienced . 'Over the past year, countless people have questioned decisions that I have made. They always do it in this seemingly innocent but quite obviously judgemental way that is hair-pullingly irritating and invariably follow it with a comment about what they might do better. 'Off the top of my head, here are some examples: . 1. You’re still feeding Poppy milk when she wakes up during the night? Oh I wouldn’t do that..she’s far too old. 2. You rock her to sleep? Do you not think she should be self settling at this age? 3. You encourage her to play with her food? Isn’t that encouraging bad manners? 4. You don’t breast feed? You do know that it really is best for bonding? 5. You take her on the underground? It’s full of germs. Why do you do that? 'Instead of doing what I should and saying 'yes I do' in a firm but polite way and ending the conversation there, I always go into great detail about why I do these things. 'No, I don’t breast feed because I find it really tough. I tried but I couldn’t do it and it was actually affecting the bonding process. I do express though…lots and it’s  exhausting but I do it because I’m trying to do my best. Nicola often finds other mothers saying to her: 'You encourage her to play with her food? Isn't that encouraging bad manners?' but says she has to believe in the choices that she makes on a daily basis because if she starts doubting herself then it won't do anyone any good…least of all Poppy . 'Yes, I sometimes rock her to sleep because she loves it and it helps her to settle. I know it’s probably not advisable at her age but it means that she goes to sleep faster and I’m knackered and I need a break and a glass of wine ASAP! 'Yes, I take her on the underground. I can’t drive and that’s how we get around and she loves it. It’s not as if she’s actually licking the floor…well even if she does it can’t be as bad as the toddler who licked the loo brush in Mc Donalds and he didn’t die did he? 'Why do I do this? Why can’t I just believe in my instinct and decisions? None of them have been taken lightly, there is a reason for all of them and as a mother, I have to believe in the choices that I make on a daily basis because if I start doubting myself then it won’t do anyone any good…least of all Poppy. Nicola says that the next time women feel judged for a decision that they have made concerning their child, they shouldn't explain themselves because, after all, they know their child better than anyone else does . 'I’m the first person to ask for advice when I need it and I often do. 'In fact, I think that one of the most beautiful things about motherhood is women passing on wisdom that they have learnt from generation to generation. It creates a magical bond amongst us that makes you proud to be a female and more importantly a mother. But, there is a difference between kindly passing on wisdom and questioning and judging fellow mamas. 'So, next time we feel judged for a decision that we have made concerning our child, let’s not explain ourselves. 'Instead, let’s believe in what we are doing and keep doing it. We know our children better than anyone else does and we are their mothers and that counts for everything!'.","Nicola Bonn, a journalist and broadcaster, shares her candid account .

"When the ultra-rich splash out on a new superyacht, they expect it to come with all the latest accessories. And that's exactly what they get with the 223ft Explorer, which comes with its own helipad, infinity pool and plenty for space for supercar and jetski storage. With space for 12 lucky guests on board, the concept yacht from British yacht designer Tony Castro is the ultimate toy for the extremely wealthy and has been dubbed the 'Range Rover of the seas'. The 223ft Explorer is an exclusive superyacht which comes with its own helipad and car storage as well as space for 12 guests . For those who don't fancy taking a dip in the sea, there is an infinity pool on deck which is two decks deep . For those who would rather board unseen, there is a helipad and helicopter storage as well as space for a submarine . It was designed to withstand any weather conditions and is sturdy enough to circumnavigate the globe - all while looking incredibly stylish, of course. When it comes to transporting all those extras any cruising millionaire needs to hand, there's plenty of space for all of them. The company explains: 'With a large carrying capacity for toys and tenders, she is capable of carrying a helicopter in a climate controlled garage, twin limo tenders, car, submarine, jetskis, paddleboards and a variety of inflatables water toys.' Once the helicopter has landed, it can be store din a climate-controlled garage area . There is storage for jetskis and a submarine on the decks, while leaving plenty of other areas free for passengers . But of course, the life of the ultra-wealthy comes at a cost. According to Tony Castro Design, the superyacht costs approximately 40million euros (around £29million/$43million) to build, which means it is likely to cost even more to purchase. While the yacht has been designed with 'rugged utilitarian-looking aesthetics', it is actually a sumptuous retreat at sea. For the 12 guests, there is space on the yacht for 15 crew, ensuring there is nothing always someone on hand to make sure the journey goes smoohtly. The layout means there are a huge variety of different areas for guests to retreat to, ensuring they don't get fed up with each other while sailing around the world. And for those who can't bear to leave their convertible at home, they can even bring their car on board . Special sundecks open out form the yacht, providing areas for loungers, complete with ladders down into the sea in case guests want to cool off in the water . Unfortunately for most, the superyacht costs 40million euros to build, meaning it will retail for even more . The designers explain: 'Her unique layout holds a full beam enclosed observation deck with opening roof, cinema, beach club, sauna, scuba diving pool, gymnasium, pool, wine cellar and ample space to accommodate a total of 12 guests.' And of course, there are all the other luxurious finishing touches you would expect to find on board. The guests of honour can enjoy accommodation in the Master Cabin or VIP suite, while others can choose between four other double guest cabins. There are also plenty of 'terrace' area, with sunloungers, giving the impression of sitting on the beach as the water laps the sands. In reality, the wooden areas just out into the sea with ladders down so guests can take a dip to cool off whenever they wish. And the entire design is offset with panoramic windows offering views across the ocean. The sleek yacht is a design by Tony Castro, who is base din The Hamble, Hampshire, which is known as a true home of yachting .","The Tony Castro design is estimated to cost 40million euros (£29m/$43m) to build and more to buy .

"For residents of Celoron, N.Y., the statue of hometown icon Lucile Ball is no laughing matter and hasn't been for the past six years. In 2009 the town unveiled a statue of Ball with a face so unlike the beloved comedian that locals have reacted with shock and horror. The depiction is so unflattering a Facebook page called 'We Love Lucy! Get Rid of this Statue' has attracted more than 600 likes. Scroll down for video . For residents of Celoron, N.Y., say a statue of hometown icon Lucile Ball is 'monstrous' The statue is based on a famous moment from Ball's show 'I Love Lucy,' in which she pitches an intoxicating health tonic while drunk . Yahoo reports that the anonymous man behind the page says he's a 'big fan of Lucy's.' 'Lucille Ball was not only an amazing comedienne, but she was a stunning beauty. Her sense of humor only made her more beautiful,” he told the site. 'This statue looks nothing like the beautiful Lucy we all know. If for no other reason than that... the statue should go.' He added: 'I don’t think this can be repaired. Take a look at the beautiful statues Nick at Nite created for ‘Bewitched’ and ‘The Honeymooners’ and Bob Newhart… it needs to be something more like those.' Artist Dave Poulin has declined comment. It would cost an estimated $8,000 to $10,000 for Poulin to recast the statue, according to the Celoron Mayor Scott Schrecengost. While the organizer said he is a fan of Poulin's work, this time he failed to do his subject justice. Artist Dave Poulin has declined to comment on the controversy surrounding his work . 'I think it looks like a monster. That is just my opinion,' he told Yahoo. 'When you see it at night, it is frightening.' The statue depicts Ball during one of her most loved moments on the pioneering show 'I Love Lucy,' her intoxicated pitch for the Vitameatavegamin health tonic. The statue was the latest way the town has tried to honor its most famous resident, with the Jameston area already home to a Lucille Ball Desi Arnaz Museum & Center for Comedy.","The depiction is so unflattering a Facebook page called 'We Love Lucy!

"Dick Advocaat will not make the same mistake he did during his first season at Rangers by playing down the significance of the Old Firm derby. The 67-year-old takes charge of Sunderland for the first time on home soil tomorrow with North-East adversaries Newcastle the visitors. It was back in 1998 that Advocaat said the Old Firm clash was just another game. Celtic won 5-1 and the Dutch boss was criticised by fans and the media for under-estimating the intensity of the rivalry. Sunderland boss Dick Advocaat insists he will not underestiamte the signficance of the Wear-Tyne Derby .

Sunderland striker Jermain Defoe (centre) trains with his team-mates ahead of the game with Newcastle . Rangers' Rod Wallace (centre) runs forward with the ball as his side are thrashed 5-1 by Celtic in 1998 . Advocaat had failed to recognise the significance of the Old Firm fixture and this led to a humiliating loss . He recalled: 'To be honest, I did not realise at that moment it was so huge. 'We lost that game and I remember saying in the press conference when they were really upset, 'It is no problem for me because it is just one of 38 games and we will not lose any more'. 'I would not say that anymore! But we became champions that year, six points ahead of Celtic, and won the treble.' Advocaat, though, does admit that his thoughts are trained on three points and not the notion of regional bragging rights. Indeed, the Black Cats are one point above the relegation zone and could be in the bottom three by kick-off. 'Every game is a chance to get a result – and that starts on Sunday,' said Advocaat, who could start Adam Johnson for the first time following his arrest on suspicion of sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl. Sunderland's Adam Johnson was recently arrested on suspicion of sexual activity with an under-age girl . Advocaat is still considering starting the 27-year-old England international in the Wear-Tyne derby . 'If we win the fans might like me, yes, but I would prefer it if they loved me at the end of the season because that would mean we have stayed up.' Sunderland have won just twice at home all season. They have struggled amid an atmosphere of unrest at the Stadium of Light, but that should change tomorrow given the unveiling of Advocaat and the opponents. 'For us, this must be a weapon,' said Advocaat when asked about the home crowd. 'That is the reason I said it is so important to get them behind us, because it is an extra weapon. If the players feel that, they will give even more and I expect that the fans will do that. This is a special game.'

"(CNN)Most companies in South Korea have hoesik at least once a month and sometimes every week. Literally, this means dinner with co-workers. In practice, it means official eating/drinking fests involving multiple rounds of alcohol at multiple venues. For the foreign business traveler, using foreignness as an excuse to bow out of the action only goes so far. The pressure to participate is intense. Drinking etiquette is the first thing you teach foreign guests,"" says Bryan Do, a Korean-American director at the South Korean branch of a U.S. company. ""It was shocking when I first arrived in Korea. ""My boss was a graduate of Korea University [renowned for its hardy drinking culture] and at my first hoesik, we started out with everyone filling a beer glass with soju, and downing it on the spot. That was just the beginning."" For Koreans, drinking is considered a way to get to know what someone is really like. ""I didn't really like it in the beginning,"" says Charles Lee, a Korean-Canadian who came to Seoul to work for a South Korean company. ""I was like, 'Why are you making me drink something when I don't want to?' But once I understood the meaning behind it, I appreciated it more. ""There are just some things you can't say at work or talk about over lunch -- people who talk about work at lunch are losers. But when someone offers you a glass of soju, it's an invitation that means that they want to listen to you. ""I thought Koreans were impersonal before I drank with them, so the whole context is important."" Drinking is such a big part of Korean life that Seoul traffic is said to correspond with the city's drinking culture. Mondays are a big night for hoesik, so there are fewer cars during evening rush hour, as most office workers leave them at work so they can go drinking. Tuesdays are a rest day, while Wednesday and Thursday nights are also big nights for company drinking. Fridays have the worst evening traffic, as everyone is taking their cars home to use with their families over the weekend. So how do you avoid offending someone (worst of all, a superior or client) at a Korean drinking extravaganza? Follow these seven handy rules. Koreans always identify the ""higher"" person in the relationship, and defer to them accordingly. One of the first things Koreans often ask when meeting someone new is their age. Even someone just a year older is afforded a language of respect, though age is always superseded by a higher position. It's considered rude for anyone to have an empty glass. If a senior person is pouring -- this usually pertains to hard liquor only -- others shouldn't drink until someone has poured the senior a shot. After all glasses are full, everyone says ""Gunbae!"" and chugs -- usually ""one-shotting"" the entire glass in one go. While downing alcohol, you should turn your body away from senior figures so that your body visually blocks your drinking action from your senior. Always hold bottles or shot glasses with both hands. By raising your glass or pouring alcohol with one hand, you are establishing yourself as a senior person. If you're not, well, you've just breached protocol. It's always a good idea to find out people's drinking habits beforehand. It shouldn't be difficult to find out what people like to drink or how they behave when intoxicated. Hoesik usually involves changing venues for a different type of alcohol -- i.e., round one is dinner, accompanied by beer, round two is soju, round three is for whiskey, and so on. Be ready for each. Unless you have an airtight reason, refusing alcohol is considered a mood killer and deemed rude. Sorry, but ""I don't like soju"" doesn't qualify as a good reason not to punish your liver. Neither would ""I've been on the wagon for three years."" In fact, unless you're pregnant or already puking, what might be a ""good reason"" not to imbibe elsewhere often won't fly here. It's generally best to accept and discreetly get rid of unwanted alcohol (under the table, into your water cup, out the window) than to refuse it. One of the most popular venues in Korea for business drinking is the karaoke bar. Koreans love singing, as evidenced by the country's staggering number of karaoke bars, as well as the rush of audition programs on Korean television. Your companions won't rest until you sing. They'll coax, threaten, push and cajole until you finally take that mic. Be prepared to crack under the immense peer pressure. If you simply cannot take any more, you can call a black knight (male) or a black rose (female) to your rescue. This entails a person of your choosing drinking your glass for you, but it also means they get a wish. As in, you might soon wish you'd just taken that last shot as you're spelling your name out with your butt in front of your client. Bottoms up.

"Older people are more susceptible to emotions when making decisions over their retirement, scientists have warned (file picture) Older people are more susceptible to emotions when making decisions over their retirement, scientists have warned. Experts in America found that more than 50 per cent of pensioners with investments during the 2007 and 2008 global financial crisis panicked and sold them after the stock market fell by 30 per cent. Research carried out by scientists at Texas Tech University showed how those who did follow that path and sold at the lowest point eight years ago with a pension of £100,000 would only have £63,000 today. If they had resisted the temptation to sell, the same pot would be worth £141,000 today provided they had not spent any of the cash. It comes just days before retirees in Britain are given the power to decide how to spend their life savings for the first time ever in the biggest shake-up of pensions for almost a century. The Daily Telegraph quotes the authors of the study, Michael Finke and Chris Browning as saying: ‘Avoiding mistakes requires the ability to regulate emotions through our more rational cognitive process. ‘Consumers are increasingly responsible for managing their retirement savings... (but) we also find that cognitive scores decline with advance age.’ The newspaper says 1,204 retired people with investments between 2006 and 2008 were analysed as part of the study, which has been published in the Journal of Consumer Affairs. It reveals that retirees with better-than-average ability to solve ‘logic problems’ were more unlikely to make misjudgments in the investment market based on their emotions. The authors add: 'Lower levels of cognitive ability in old age can reduce an investor's ability to control emotional responses to a loss. Anyone in Britain turning 55 who isn’t in a final salary scheme will soon be allowed to dip in to their pension and take the income they need, under reforms announced by George Osborne (pictured) 'Greater sensitivity to loss may increase preferences for safety following a market decline, resulting in allocations away from stocks that are associated with long-term underperformance.' Under reforms announced by Chancellor George Osborne, anyone in Britain turning 55 who isn’t in a final salary scheme will simply be allowed to dip in to their pension and take the income they need from April 5. They could keep the money invested in the stock market to boost their profits. And if they die their spouse or loved ones will be able to inherit whatever is left over.","Half of pensioners in US with investments during 2007 financial crisis sold them at wrong time, research finds .

"Game of Thrones fans who did not want to wait and legally watch HBO's hit series premiere its fifth season tonight have leaked the first four episodes online. Online pirates have unveiled nearly  half of the show's next season, which is scheduled to debut its first episode tonight. The episodes began appearing on torrent download sites on Saturday night, and are thought to have leaked from review copies given to the press. Fans of the show, which follows the ambitions and betrayals of competing noble factions and families in the fantasy world of Westeros, now face the daunting task of avoiding spoilers online as the first four episodes are released over the course of the month. Scroll down for video . Game of Thrones, which includes characters such as Emilia Clarke's Khaleesi (left) and Nathalie Emmanuel's Missandei (right), was pirated before its season five debut tonight . Episodes beginning this year's season are titled The Wars to Come, The House of Black and White, High Sparrow and The Sons of the Harpy. They had been downloaded more than 550,000 times as of early Sunday morning, Variety reported, citing the piracy-tracking company Excipio. 'Sadly, it seems the leaked four episodes of the upcoming season of Game of Thrones originated from within a group approved by HBO to receive them. We're actively assessing how this breach occurred,' HBO said in a statement to Daily Mail Online. The series is the most illegally downloaded program in the world. Anti-piracy company Irdeto said that episodes from Game of Thrones's first four seasons were illegally downloaded more than seven million times between February and April 2015. The astounding figure is a 45 per cent jump over the same period from 2014 for the show, which debuted in 2011. The first four episodes had been downloaded more than 550,000 times as of early Sunday morning. Above, Kit Harrington's character Jon Snow (left) and Peter Dinklage's Tyrion Lannister (right) feature in the show . Brazil and France are the top two countries by illegal downloads of the series inspired by George R R Martin's Song of Ice and Fire novels. They are followed by the US, Canada and the UK. Walking Dead, with 5.7million illegal downloads from February to April, was the second-most pirated show. HBO planned Sunday's premier to air across 170 countries at the same time in an effort to combat international piracy of the show.

"The artist behind a statue of Lucille Ball so terrifying it has been nicknamed 'Scary Lucy' has admitted to being 'disappointed' in his work, offering to fix the sculpture for free. Residents of Celoron, New York, hometown of the famous comedienne, reacted with shock and horror when the 'I Love Lucy' statue was unveiled in 2009. Following a recent social media campaign to have the bronze statue removed, sculptor Dave Poulin  called it 'by far my most unsettling sculpture', and pledged to make a new one. Following a campaign to have the statue of Lucille Ball sculptor Dave Poulin has pledged to make a new one . The depiction is so unflattering a Facebook page called 'We Love Lucy! Get Rid of this Statue' has attracted more than 600 likes. Yahoo reports that the anonymous man behind the page says he's a 'big fan of Lucy's.' 'Lucille Ball was not only an amazing comedienne, but she was a stunning beauty. Her sense of humor only made her more beautiful,” he told the site. 'This statue looks nothing like the beautiful Lucy we all know. If for no other reason than that... the statue should go.' However, in a letter to the Hollywood Reporter, Poulin admits: From the day of its installation, I have shared my disappointment in the final outcome and have always believed it to be by far my most unsettling sculpture, not befitting of Lucy’s beauty or my ability as a sculptor. 'In retrospect, it should have never been cast in bronze and made public, and I take complete ownership of that poor decision.' For residents of Celoron, N.Y., say a statue of hometown icon Lucile Ball is 'monstrous' The statue is based on a famous moment from Ball's show 'I Love Lucy,' in which she pitches an intoxicating health tonic while drunk . He adds that he offers to return to Celoron and 'remove the current statue with the promise of creating a new beautiful and charming ""Lucy"" in its place.' It would cost an estimated $8,000 to $10,000 for Poulin to recast the statue, according to the Celoron Mayor Scott Schrecengost. While the organizer said he is a fan of Poulin's work, this time he failed to do his subject justice. 'I think it looks like a monster. That is just my opinion,' he told Yahoo. 'When you see it at night, it is frightening.' The statue depicts Ball during one of her most loved moments on the pioneering show 'I Love Lucy,' her intoxicated pitch for the Vitameatavegamin health tonic. The statue was the latest way the town has tried to honor its most famous resident, with the Jameston area already home to a Lucille Ball Desi Arnaz Museum & Center for Comedy.","The depiction is so unflattering a Facebook page called 'We Love Lucy!

"A Mayfair mansion that was once the site of a milking parlour has gone on the market for £25million. The four-bedroom property in central London's Farm Street has all the trappings of modern luxury with an indoor swimming pool, gym, lift, cinema room and roof terrace. One hundred and fifty years ago however it was used to house cows for milking on one of London's busiest trading streets. Originally used as a milking parlour, it  became a depot before being knocked down in the 19th Century. In 2011 developers took over the site and demolished the house to make way for the plush mansion which now sits in its place. At 8,139 square ft, it is on the market for £25million. A newly-built mansion that was constructed on the site of a former milking parlour in Mayfair has gone on the market for £25million . The house is decorated throughout with modern furnishings and plush carpets. Among its features is a private lift and guest cloakroom . A grand piano sits in the marbled hall on one of the floor's houses. A 14-piece dining table is also featured in the luxury dining room . An indoor swimming pool now takes the place of what once would have been a milking shed in the 18th and 19th Century . A cinema room is one of the many modern features in the property. It was built in 2011 after developers knocked down the original structure . Impressive artwork throughout the house adorns its walls. It is being sold for £25million by estate agents Wetherell and Knight Frank . An opulent 14-place dining table is found on the first floor of the luxury property which also has its own lift . London's milking parlours date back to Tudor times, with Farm Street serving as hub of agricultural trade for years. Cows were brought there from the grazing areas of Peckham, Holland Park and Hampstead heath and sold to local butchers. Alongside the parlours was an abattoir and pub, the Punch Bowl, which remains. Guy Ritchie and Madonna bought the pub while they were married and it quickly became a celebrity favourite. Mr Ritchie sold it in 2013 to the Alexander Langlands Pearse. Inside the modern mansion are four bedrooms including a master suite which occupies the entire second floor. The lower ground floors feature a swimming pool complex with mosaic-lined pool, steam room, gym, shower and changing facilities, kitchenette, guest cloakroom and media room. It also has a private lift, marble flooring, a sweeping spiral staircase and a dining room which can seat 14. Speaking of the property, Peter Wetherell, chief executive of Wetherell, said: 'This recently built house is an outstanding example of contemporary living in historic Mayfair at its very best. 'As the location of Mayfair’s dairy, the interesting and unusual history allowed for the construction of a house on a commercial depot site, without the usual restrictions of historic listing controls. 'The result is an open flowing family house providing spacious rooms and generous ceiling heights rarely found in historic Mayfair.' The house has four bedrooms which all come with their own en suite bathrooms and is set over four floors. It was built in 2011 . One of the four bedrooms in the house is finished with sleek white, grey and black furniture and soft furnishings throughout . Another of the guest rooms in the luxury mansion furnished in cream and peach. The house has been described by estate agents as a 'flowing family house' One of the double bathrooms in the house has a deep marble bath, his and her's sinks and a large, walk-in shower . The property's master suite takes up the entire second floor with a huge bedroom and 'living space' which features a stunning fireplace . The dressing room in the master suite boasts high-gloss white wardrobes, fluffy white carpet and a grey bench for resting . An enormous jacuzzi bath in the middle of the master suite's bathroom, with his and her sinks and a walk in double shower beyond it . Another of the luxurious bathrooms is fitted with a black and grey bath and shower. Experts said the property was an example of 'contemporary living in historic Mayfair' A courtyard in the property offers another outdoor seating. Part of its tiles have been replaced with glass exposing the leisure complex beneath . The luxury home also has a steam room adorned in shimmer silver mosaic and several outdoor spaces for residents to take in sun . A sweeping sun terrace on the building's roof where residents and guests can take in views of the historic Mayfair village . A sleek white and brown kitchen leads out to a sun-trapped patio on one of the house's floors. There is also a kitchenette elsewhere .

"The National Trust has replaced antique furniture with beanbags at one of its historic homes in an ‘experiment’ which has enraged heritage experts. Furniture dating back to 1820 was moved from the library at Ickworth House in Suffolk earlier this year and replaced with four brown leatherette bean bags. The move was designed to encourage visitors to ‘dwell and take in the atmosphere’ in the room but it provoked fury from heritage expects who branded the move ‘misguided’. The National Trust has replaced antique furniture with beanbags in the library of Ickworth House, Suffolk . Now it has emerged that similar experiments will take place at nine other of its venues around the country. Art historian Bendor Grosvenor, whose blog post on his Art History News site about Ickworth sparked the controversy, told The Independent: ‘I suspect the hoo-ha about the beanbags may at least cause them rethink what they were going to do. The National Trust said the beanbag experiment was 'short-term' Pictured: Ickworth House, Suffolk . ‘I don’t think you’ll ever bring in a new audience by talking down to it. Experimentation and bringing in new audiences are marvellous but there are better ways of doing it by taking away things people might want to see. It’s patronising nonsense.’ The National Trust’s director of strategy, curatorship and external affairs Simon Murray told The Art Newspaper that the Trust ‘presents each house in context’ and that each is different and treated appropriately. He said: ‘We are not a museum that takes objects, shows them in a display case, shines a light on them and labels them’. But he said this meant that ‘many visitors find a vast array of objects in front of them, cast a cursory eye over them and don’t get a great deal from the experience.’ He said the beanbag experiment was a short-term arrangement which would not necessarily continue for the whole year. But he added: ‘Some of our staff think we should have used a rather different sort of seating and others think it is good as an experiment.’","Four brown leatherette bean bags placed in library at Ickworth House .

"Three people have been taken to hospital following a head-on collision between a vintage sports car and a 4WD. The crash happened on Easter Sunday night on Warringah Road in Frenchs Forest, northern Sydney at a traffic light intersection. The 1973 E-Type Jaguar, which is thought to be worth over $120,000 was completely written off when it came up against the Toyota Kluger on their Sunday drive. A 1973 E-Type Jaguar has been involved in a crash with a Toyota Kluger . Nobody was hurt in the collision, however all three adults were taken to hospital as a precaution. NSW police told Daily Mail Australia that they are still investigating the circumstances surrounding the devastating collision. The photos of the crash were posted to the NSW Traffic and Highway Patrol Command's Facebook page, where car enthusiasts were quick to sympathise with the owner of the classic Jaguar. The crash occurred on Warringah Road in Frenchs Forest . 'That is a really, really rare car. They go for over $120,000. I feel sorry for the owner,' one Facebook user said. 'How could a modern car hit a classic car - I just don't know. We need to admire and respect drivers that take the time to restore and drive classic cars. It's part of our motoring history,' another commenter said. 'As a car enthusiast I died a little,' one user said. The $120,000 Jaguar was completely written off in the crash . The crash comes after police warned motorists to obey the road rules over the Easter long weekend or risk 'ending up in custody, hospital or the morgue'. Extra police are on duty during the annual Operation Tortoise, which sees the force crack-down on drink-driving and reckless driving.","Three adults taken to hospital after head on collision at Frenchs Forest .

"Geoff Barrow has accused streaming services of giving music away, saying his band Portishead were paid just £1,700 despite getting 34million plays . The founder of rock band Portishead has waded into the debate over music streaming, saying that he received just £1,700 in royalties despite his songs being played 34million times. In a series of tweets Geoff Barrow, Portishead's founder and instrumentalist, attacked Spotify, YouTube, Apple and 'especially' Universal Music for selling his music cheaply. He added that he has nothing against streaming, but wants musicians to be paid more, and says it is hurting young talent, stopping people from establishing themselves on the scene. Barrow, who also runs the Invada record label, told The Times: 'You used to write a piece of music and people paid you to listen to it. 'Yet for younger artists who just want to play rock and roll, by the time they get to a major label, all their rights will have been sold away. 'There will be not much meat left on the bone. You see these huge deals but will smaller bands be able to buy a Ford Galaxy to go on tour in if this isn't sorted out?' Artists have long railed against the low royalties paid from streaming companies, leading to Jay-Z launching his own Tidal service this month, promising bigger returns for musicians. Pop megastar Taylor Swift and Thom York, frontman of indie rockers Radiohead, have also pulled their music from services such as Spotify in protest. However, record companies have been quick to upload their music on to these platforms to prop up the collapse in CD sales after music moved online. Barrow, who heads up record label Invada as well as playing in Portishead (pictured), said he was not opposed to streaming technology, but was concerned young artists were getting a poor deal . Streaming companies have also defended their practices, saying they offer artists a fair price in an age where music can be easily accessed for nothing. Rihanna, Madonna, Beyonce, Usher, Daft Punk, Arcade Fire, Jack White and Kanye West banded together to help launch Jay Z's $20-a-month Tidal streaming service last month, which aims to offer artists a better deal. The membership-based service  will operate in a similar format to Spotify, providing music and exclusive videos that users can stream on computers, tablets and smartphones or listen to offline. The ongoing row between artists, music labels and streaming companies lead to Jay Z launching his own service, Tidal, which aims to give musicians a better deal . Backed by a host of musicians such as Arcade Fire, Daft Punk, Madonna, and Alicia Keys, Jay Z plans to charge £20-per-month for the service, and will give the artists a bigger share . Unlike Spotify there isn't a free service and users will have to pay $9.95 for standard sound quality or $19.99 for 'lossless high fidelity sound quality.' Tidal streams at 1,411 kilobytes per second - well above the 320 for premium subscribers of Spotify, which offers lower levels for free users.

"Three hours after giving birth to her longed-for baby girl, Lianne Hindle lay dead in the same hospital bed. The mother-of-four suffered a cardiac arrest at the scandal-hit North Manchester General Hospital in December. The 37-year-old's death came just months after three babies and one mother died at the maternity unit. The deaths, along with those of four babies and two mothers at the Royal Oldham Hospital prompted an investigation. Today Ms Hindle's partner Chris Barnes and his sister Karen have called for action to prevent further tragedies. Chris Barnes, whose partner Lianne Hindle died three hours after giving birth to their daughter Poppy (pictured with brothers Zac and Louie), is calling for action to prevent further tragedies at North Manchester General Hospital . The 40-year-old father-of-four said: 'Something has to be done. It isn't right. 'This is still happening. Maternity units are supposed to be the safest places to have babies.' Mr Barnes, who suffers with cerebral palsy, has been left to care for the couple's three-month-old daughter Poppy, and her three brothers, Morgan, 15, Zac, nine, and Louie, seven. North Manchester General and the Royal Oldham Hospital called in independent experts to review its maternity units after the spate of 10 deaths in the eight-month period from December 2013 to July last year. Ms Hindle, from Bury, died in December - her death falling outside the scope of the investigation. She went into labour at almost 35 weeks pregnant, in the early hours of December 15. The expectant mother was scheduled to give birth at St Mary's Hospital, which has a specialist intensive care baby unit, after suffering two previous stillbirths, and three premature pregnancies. But she was taken to North Manchester General by ambulance instead, after it became clear she was going to give birth before she could get to St Mary's. This is the only picture Ms Hindle's family have of her holding daughter Poppy . Immediately after welcoming baby Poppy shortly after 2am, Mr Barnes said his partner appeared 'fine', holding the newborn and naming her. But just an hour later,  she started to feel unwell  - complaining that she was 'red hot'. Ms Barnes described how Ms Hindle started to look 'deathly white', and felt cold and clammy to touch, before her eyes began rolling back in her head. Her blood pressure and heart rate plummeted as her condition deteriorated and she died at around 6am after suffering a cardiac arrest. Ms Barnes said the family has concerns about the care Ms Hindle received, claiming she was left alone with a student midwife following the birth, once the placenta had been delivered. 'Lianne was repeatedly talking of how red hot she was, asking for a fan and the windows to be opened,' Ms Barnes said. 'The student midwife said that was normal after having a baby and wafted her with a sick bowl. 'I didn't see Lianne's temperature taken once.' Ms Barnes claimed at one point, a member of staff came into the room and asked the student midwife: 'Who are you supposed to be with?' To which the student replied, ""exactly"", Ms Barnes said. Ms Hindle's family said no one from the hospital had contacted them since her death. Ms Barnes added: 'That makes us feel that she just wasn't important to them.' Mr Barnes, who suffers cerebral palsy, has been left to care for the couple's four children, Zac, nine, Morgan, 15, three-month-old Poppy, and Louie, seven . A spokesman for The Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust said: 'Our condolences go out to the family in this tragic case. 'Lianne was diverted to us as an emergency on the way to another hospital. 'She was not previously known to our maternity service and while her baby was delivered safely, tragically Lianne subsequently died. 'We are unable to comment further as this case has been referred to the coroner and has not yet been heard. 'We deliver 10,000 babies each year and would like to reassure families about the safety of maternity services at our hospitals, but if any expectant mother has a concern they can contact their designated midwife to discuss this.' Mr Barnes said: 'Lianne had always dreamed of a little girl. She was a strong character and loved her family. Her death has shocked and devastated us. It doesn't seem real. 'The boys have been pretty resilient but Louie is a mummy's boy and recently has been waking up in the night and crying out for her. That has been hard to take.' A date for her inquest has not yet been set. An investigation was launched at the North Manchester General Hospital after the deaths of three babies and a mother at the hospital between December 2013 and July last year. The probe also looked at the deaths of four babies and two mothers at the Royal Oldham Hospital over the same time period . A catalogue of failings have been uncovered at two NHS hospitals after seven babies and three mothers died there in the space of just eight months. Independent investigators were called into Royal Oldham after the deaths of four babies and two mothers, and North Manchester General after the deaths of another three babies and one mother. Lisa Parkisson, 35, died at Oldham Royal 48 hours after giving birth in April this year, while newborn Thomas Beaty died at the same hospital in June after doctors pushed him back into the womb during birth. A summary of the investigation, which was kept secret from the families of the dead until now, has been seen by MailOnline and found 'notable absence of clinical leadership' in the maternity wards, and a 'failure to adequately plan care' in a number of cases. Lisa Parkisson, 35, (left with son Zac) died 48 hours after giving birth at Oldham Royal in June last year. Thomas Beaty (right) died from  at the same hospital after doctors forced him back into the womb . A team of independent investigators also found risk management was 'below standard' in some cases - though there were no apparent 'deficiencies in care' in the deaths of the three mothers. The report noted that several of the mothers were obese or morbidly obese, which can lead to complications, but that national guidelines for treating overweight people were not followed. Officials also criticised the hospital's own investigations, saying the root cause of the deaths was not always identified, opportunities to learn lessons were not always picked up, and that some recommendations were too general and difficult to measure. All of the deaths are believed to have occurred between December 2013, and July last year. Pennine Acute is in the process of producing an action plan based on the recommendations from the findings. They include strengthening clinical leadership and risk management, making sure enough staff are on duty to ensure safety and reviewing the process for employing temporary locum doctors. Gill Harris, chief nurse at Pennine Acute, said last week: 'The Trust is always keen to learn and to improve care. We commissioned a review by experts from outside the Trust to look at the details of a small number of maternity cases at our hospitals. Independent investigators found failings in care and hospital leadership at Oldham Royal following the deaths of four babies and two mothers there in eight months . 'We are now considering that report and are developing a number of actions as a result to make some improvements to ensure we continue to provide the best quality of care for our patients. 'We deliver 10,000 babies each year and would like to reassure families about the safety of maternity services at our hospitals, but if any expectant mother has a concern they can contact their designated midwife to discuss this.' A spokeswoman for the Care Quality Commission, the health regulator, said: 'CQC is aware that Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust has recently initiated an external review into its maternity services and we are in close liaison with the trust, NHS England and local CCG regarding the review findings.'","Lianne Hindle suffered a cardiac arrest at North Manchester General .

United go into the clash against City ahead of them in the Premier League table for the first time since the Sir Alex Ferguson era, and victory at Old Trafford could see them move four points clear of Manuel Pellegrini's side in fourth. With seven games to go, the two Manchester sides are battling out with Arsenal for second place in the Premier League, and hoping to stave off any potential surge into the Champions League positions from the likes of Liverpool and Tottenham, who linger in fifth and sixth respectively. City have won on their last three visits to Old Trafford - the famous 6-1 in 2011/12, 2-1 in 2012/13 and 3-0 last season - which is a run Rooney and Co will be desperately hoping to bring to an end.

He said: 'We know it will be tough but as long as we can play the way we have shown, especially in the last few games, and add to that, it's going to be a great game and hopefully we will get the three points. 'We want to keep the momentum going and the positive play. It would be nice (to finish above City) but we are just taking each game as it comes.

"CCTV footage of the devastating moment a man put his brother in a coma with a single punch has been released for the first time, with the brother responsible soon to learn if he will serve prison time. Downing Centre Local Court showed the security footage of the violent altercation between Irishman Barry Lyttle and his younger brother, Patrick, during a sentence hearing on Wednesday. Prosecutor Alex Poulos called for Barry, from Belfast in Ireland's north, to face a full-time jail term as it was the 'only appropriate sentence' after the violent incident in Sydney in January. Scroll down for video . After being pushed by Patrick Lyttle, his brother retaliates with a single punch (left) which causes his brother to fall to the ground, his head snapping back and body crumpling (right) Barry Lyttle has been charged with grievous bodily harm and has pleaded guilty to the charge . Magistrate Graeme Curran said a jail sentence was likely, explaining 'the issue is whether or not I suspend a prison term'. Barry could spend up to two years in a Sydney jail, despite his brother's calls for the charges to be dropped. On Thursday, security footage was shown for the first time, revealing the details of the distressing altercation outside Hugo's Lounge in Sydney's Potts Point when Patrick received a single blow to the head during an argument with his brother Barry. In court on Thursday, Patrick comforted his inconsolable brother as they watched the footage. Before the fight the brothers, who had only been reunited for a holiday in Australia for a matter of days, are seen chatting jovially and patting each other on the back affectionately. But after leaving the bar a fight escalated quickly. The court saw footage of the brothers standing nose-to-nose, exchanging some tense words. As Barry starts to walk away from the argument, Patrick pushes his big brother roughly. Patrick was treated by paramedics at the scene where he was found in a pool of blood and vomit on January 3 . Patrick Lyttle (middle) has called on charges against his brother Barry (left) to be dropped . The brothers from Belfast in Ireland (pictured here as children) went on a night out on January 3 in Kings Cross . Mr Lyttle pleaded guilty after the crown declined to downgrade the charge against him . The Irishman could learn his fate as soon as Thursday afternoon when the matter returns to court for a possible sentencing hearing . A split second later, Barry retaliates with a brutal punch to Patrick's head. It is a distressing scene as Patrick's head snaps back from the force of Barry's blow. His body buckles beneath him and he crumples to the ground, his head slamming against the pavement. As Patrick lies unresponsive on the ground, a clearly-distressed Barry immediately rushes to his brother's side, frantically trying to revive him. Patrick nearly lost his life after suffering traumatic head injuries. He was found by emergency services in a pool of blood and vomit, and remained in a coma at Sydney's St Vincent's Hospital for six days after the January 3 altercation. Patrick says he has since made a 'fantastic recovery.' Barry pleaded guilty to recklessly causing grievous bodily harm, whilst his brother called for the charges to be dismissed. Barry Lyttle (pictured left) has pleaded guilty to causing his brother Patrick (right) grievous bodily harm . The Lyttle family has previously said they believe the charge against Barry (centre) should be dropped . Patrick Lyttle (right) said he had made a 'fantastic recovery' On Thursday, Patrick delivered an impassioned victim's statement, pleading for Barry to be spared a prison sentence and for the family to be allowed to return to Ireland together to 'heal'. 'When my family is healed I will be healed,' Patrick Lyttle told the court. 'It has been an awful ordeal for me but everyone can see it has been for Barry too. 'Victims often want to see deterrence. But everyone can see how much my brother has suffered.' Patrick also pointed out their father Oliver's health has greatly suffered as a result of the trauma. Their father was in Australia with the two men on what had intended as a trip of a lifetime, but has become a nightmare. Barry Lyttle is pictured arriving at court with his brother, Patrick, and his girlfriend, Patricia last week . 'He doesn't want to go home without his two sons,' Patrick said. Patrick asked the court to consider allowing Barry to return to Ireland so the brothers can embark on a career in youth work, telling young people their story to warn of the dangers of violence. Barry's lawyer Chris Watson said his client was remorseful, unlikely to re-offend and of good character. The 33-year-old will be sentenced in Sydney's local court, where the maximum jail term is two years, rather than the district court, where people could face up to 10 years for that offence. Barry Lyttle's barrister Chris Watson said the punch was a 'very emotional, spur of the moment act' that immediately followed being aggressively attacked by his brother, and that Barry Lyttle had immediately shown 'an extreme level of contrition and remorse', according to the Sydney Morning Herald. Any animosity between the two has since gone and they walked from court together on Thursday, as they have done at earlier appearances. Barry will return to court for sentencing on April 24.

"Brendan Rodgers has criticised Raheem Sterling’s advisor, suggesting that the player is being manipulated by outside forces and that he would be inclined to stay at Liverpool if left to make a decision alone. With Liverpool losing 4-1 at Arsenal on Saturday and seeing their hopes of qualifying for the Champions League next season effectively ending, Rodgers made veiled criticisms of the player’s agent, Aidy Ward, after the televised interview Sterling gave last week, in which he admitted he was flattered by Arsenal’s interest in him. Rodgers also revealed that he has sat down with Sterling since that TV interview and to tell him that his best interest would be served by staying at the club for now, even though there may come a time when he does leave. Raheem Sterling  goes past Mathieu Flamini during the Barclays Premier League match at the Emirates . Sterling has reject a contract extension worth £100,000 a week and has just two years left on his deal at the end of this season, but Rodgers said: ‘I’ve had a good chat with him. I have given him my opinion on it. This is a young kid who has been advised to do something else. A 20-year-old boy does not pick up the phone to ask to speak to the BBC. ‘You don’t do that; him in particular. He just wants to play his football. But of course if he’s asked to do that by other parties then that’s what he’ll do. ‘In the modern game it is obviously something that frustrates us all but it is the market and where football is at. In fairness to Raheem, I brought him in from the youth team and the reserves and I know that a big part of this is actually nothing to do with him.’ Sterling has rejected a contract extension worth £100,000 a week and has just two years left on his deal . ‘In my time in coaching there are a lot of very, very good agents. The only thing I would say on Raheem’s situation is that anyone can see that for his football development and financially, Liverpool Football Club is the best place for him. There is absolutely no question of that. ‘I think he enjoys being at Liverpool and loves playing for Liverpool and knows he is privileged to play in front of Liverpool supporters. As a kid he knows the opportunity is there for him to improve as a footballer. What that will be in five, six, seven years time is different. But for this moment of his career and life, he really enjoys it. He has said that himself. He has talked very openly about loving his football and playing for a great club like Liverpool.’ Sterling said he was flattered by Arsenal's interest in signing him should he leave Liverpool this summer . Sterling grapples with Arsenal defender Hector Bellerin during Liverpool's defeat to the Gunners . Rodgers admits that the task may have become more difficult now that Liverpool’s hunt for a top four spot seems to have come to an end but remains confident that he can persuade the player to extend his deal . ‘As long as the player can see the ambition of the club. We all know the reality of where the game is at in this country. There are bigger spenders than ourselves and more experienced squads – the model at Liverpool is different. ‘Of course players will want to look at possibilities when that time comes. But when you talk specifically about Raheem – because he’s got huge potential but there’s still a bit to go - then I think Liverpool is the best place for him. Sterling competes with Laurent Koscielny during a defeat which all-but ends Liverpool's top four chances . ‘He has had the opportunity to play, which is key for a young player. It is the model of Liverpool, which the owners have put in, where they want to create the world class talent. He has just turned 20. There is still a long way for him to go and he has a lot of potential. I believe that will be developed over the next coming years at Liverpool. ‘It is the job of his advisors to look at the possibilities might be beyond that. But he has two and a half years left and won’t be going anywhere in the summer – that’s for sure. And we’ll sit down again with the club and his representatives to hopefully find the solution in the summer.’ Sterling is taken to ground by Arsenal's German defender Per Mertesacker during the game in north London . Rodgers went out of his way to play the player, who missed an easy first half opportunity to put Liverpool ahead but who was their most consistent threat and won them the penalty they scored. Rodgers said: ‘There was no change in him. I thought he was excellent today, our best player. He was aggressive in his running, pressed the ball well, he won the penalty. He was very direct and strong. ‘This is a kid that is really focused on his football. There’s no change and he works hard every single day. And you see from today, he just wants to play his football. The kid for me gives me everything the way he trains and plays.’","Brendan Rodgers has hit out at those advising Raheem Sterling .

"A freezer trawler has sunk in a peninsula off the coast of Russia, killing at least 56 crew members. A massive rescue operation involving more than 1,300 people is now underway after the ship, carrying an international crew of 132, sank in the Sea of Okhotsk in just 15 minutes. Rescued crew members reported that the ship, called the Dalny Vostock, was unstable because of empty fuel tanks and a lack of ballast as it sailed through the Kamchatka Peninsula. The Russian freezer trawler, called the Dalny Vostok, that sank while carrying 132 crew members at 4am on Thursday morning local time. At least 54 bodies have been recovered in the huge rescue operation . Map showing the location of the disaster. There are 13 members of the crew are still missing after the trawler tipped over when a fishing net was pulled in, a regional governor told Russian television on Thursday . It tipped over when a fishing net weighing 80 tons was pulled in, said Oleg Kozhemyako, acting governor of the nearby Sakhalin region. Kozhemyako's comments on Russian television came after the federal Investigative Committee said it was considering all possible causes for the sinking, but it was likely that the trawler hit 'an object' floating in the sea, perhaps drifting ice. More than 26 fishing boats in the area have helped to rescue members of the crew, but have also recovered 56 bodies. The disaster happened at around 4am local time, and the trawler did not send any distress signals before it sank, the Interfax News Agency said. Early reports added that the Dalny Vostok sank in just 15 minutes after its engine compartment had been flooded. So far 63 people have been rescued, with survivors suffering from hypothermia and other injuries being airlifted to hospital. At the latest count there are 13 people still missing. An emergency services representative told local media that two of the bodies were found on Thursday evening - one in a lifeboat 105 kilometres (65 miles) away, and the other in the water nearby. Those saved had managed to get into lifeboats and some had put on wet suits. The Russian Emergencies Ministry sent an Mi-8 helicopter with rescuers and doctors aboard to treat and transport rescued crew members to hospitals in the city of Magadan, it said on its website. A rescuer uses a satellite phone while onboard a helicopter as they fly over the Sea of Okhotsk scouring the waters for survivors. Around 1,300 fishermen and emergency staff are involved in the rescue operation . A Russian Emergencies Ministry ship looks for survivors after the Dalny Vostock sank. Temperatures in the water can dip to as low as -2 degrees celsius, and so far it is confirmed that 56 crew members have drowned . A telephone hotline for families of the crew has also been set up. Among the 132 crew members, 78 are from Russia, 42 from Myanmar and the rest from Latvia, Ukraine and Vanuatu. Pyotr Osichansky, president of the Far Eastern Association of Sea Captains, told Russian television that when the trawler last docked in Russia, in January, it had fewer than 70 crew members. The additional crew members were most likely picked up in Pusan, South Korea, and were working illegally, he said. The Sea of Okhotsk is the coldest sea in East Asia with the air temperature plummeting to -20 degrees Celsius in the winter months. Following the tragedy 63 people have been rescued, but the bodies of 56 sailors have been pulled from the freezing sea. Early reports say the trawler sank in 15 minutes when its engine room was flooded . Between October and April the area the area is 'constantly' covered with ice and there is very little rain, according to Encyclopedia Britannica. Survivors of the incident are reportedly being interviewed as well as the owners of the trawler, as the police start investigating the disaster. It is understood they are questioning whether there was a violation of safety procedures that led to more deaths, a report in Russia Today said. The 100-metre long trawler was built in 1989 and was equipped to freeze and can fish.","Trawler was carrying 132 crew members when it sank in Sea of Okhotsk .

Even details of dieters and those who have had plastic surgery appear on the list of data for sale. The Mail has this week exposed companies that have secretly sold private financial and medical information without proper checks. Our investigation has revealed that: . The revelations have prompted probes by the Information Commissioner’s Office and the Direct Marketing Commission. A third investigation has been launched by the General Pharmaceutical council into Pharmacy2U, the UK’s biggest online pharmacy. The Mail revealed that Pharmacy2U had passed information on NHS patients to Alchemy Direct Media. The eating disorder data – passed to the Mail by a whistleblower – is being touted by a firm called Sequester, which is a business partner of Alchemy. Sequester is offering to sell information on people suffering from 43 different health conditions – from skin problems to insomnia and migraines. It claims to be able to identify those who have had plastic surgery, who smoke, wear glasses or contact lenses or have sensitive teeth. It also appears to offer details of which credit cards people have and which banks they use, as well as whether they have wills or health insurance. Such data is a goldmine for unscrupulous firms and criminals – who can use it to target vulnerable individuals and scam them over the phone. The whistleblower, who works in the data industry, said it was ‘madness’ that so much personal information was available to him and he had passed it to the Mail because he was worried about who else might have access to it. He said: ‘I am not registered with the regulators, I’m just a man who has worked in the industry at some point – and all this information is available to me. It’s absolute madness.’ The list of categories of data was contained in an email – seen by the Mail – from Sequester’s CEO Matthew Foy in which he described the information his firm was able to supply on its new database. At the top of the email, he writes: ‘Please do not distribute this list.’ The whistleblower said: ‘Imagine who else could get their hands on this. When I realised the level of information companies like Sequester have, that is when I knew how serious a problem this is. ‘We give our private health and financial details to people we trust, it is not fair they end up in the hands of people we don’t.’ He said he had been sent databases containing records of thousands of people’s pensions, investments and intimate health details. Dr Sarah Wollaston, who was the Tory chairman of the Commons health committee, said 'it's appalling' One of those on Sequester’s arthritis database is Diana Doyle from Wandsworth in London, who says she is ‘frightened’ her health details are being sold on. The grandmother, whose husband suffers from vascular dementia and is in a home, added: ‘I’m a very private person, I always say, “No thank you” when asked for my details. ‘I’m on my own at home now, so this is very frightening.’ She suspects her medical details were obtained from a survey she filled out in a catalogue. The 74-year-old has had to change her home phone number because she was getting so many nuisance calls. Dr Sarah Wollaston, who was the Tory chairman of the Commons health committee, last night said: ‘It is appalling that this kind of deeply personal and sensitive information is being traded. It is deeply worrying.’ When approached by the Mail, bosses at Sequester, which describes itself as a data controller, claimed they had never actually distributed any information on eating disorders or any of the other sensitive health information advertised in the email. Chief executive Mr Foy said the company did not hold such information and that his email had simply been saying that ‘this list is available on the market, that we could find it for a client’. ‘That does not necessarily mean it is available for release,’ he said. Watchdog will probe 'rogue' data firms who sold Mail's undercover reporters the financial data of 15,000 people . By Lucy Osborne . Two firms exposed by the Daily Mail as selling private information are to be probed by the industry watchdog. B2C Data sold our undercover reporters the financial data of 15,000 people – including details about their pension pots, incomes and investments. The second firm – Data Bubble – supplied our team with health details on 3,000 patients – such as whether they suffered from high blood pressure, arthritis or even bladder problems. The Direct Marketing Commission said it would probe both companies over claims that they had breached the rules on the sale of private data. It confirmed it was ‘formally investigating two companies following allegations in the Daily Mail that personal data was shared inappropriately and without the consent of users’. George Kidd, the chief commissioner, said: ‘The allegations in the Daily Mail are serious. People must be able to trust those with whom they share their data. We will look carefully at the roles and conduct of these two companies and advise the Direct Marketing Association on our findings quickly.’ The firms are already at the centre of a major probe by the Information Commissioner’s Office, which said the sale of such details was ‘on the face of it, a very serious breach of the Data Protection Act’. In meetings covertly filmed by our reporters, bosses at B2C Data were seen boasting of how they held thousands of details on every family in Britain. One, Gareth Doran, boasted: ‘We know what clothes they buy, what health products they buy, where they go on holiday, how many times they go on holiday, what income they’ve got, whether they have children.’ Data Bubble bosses offered to provide our reporters with the names of people with ‘different ailments’ for around 16p each. When asked how the information was obtained, the firm’s owner, hypnotherapist Joanne Clayton, said: ‘It could be people who bought mobility products from a catalogue … or even if they’ve been on holiday and they’ve ticked to say that they are needing help on the flight with regards to that, we can then identify that they actually have problems with mobility.’ Both companies sold the records despite not carrying out checks on the Mail’s bogus cold calling firm. Had they done so they would have quickly discovered it was simply a website and was not registered or regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. The announcement follows calls – led by David Cameron – for a clampdown on companies found guilty of selling personal data without consent. The Prime Minister suggested on Monday night that the law would be tightened if loopholes were being exploited by unscrupulous cold callers.","Sequester is offering details of eating disorder sufferers for 12p a head .

"One season soon, there will be more people watching each Premier League match live in the USA than in Britain. That is the confident expectation of broadcasting titan NBC, who hold the live rights to show matches Stateside and have more than doubled US interest in England’s elite division in the past two years. In 2012-13, some 13 million different Americans watched at least one top-flight English game live. Last season that was 32 million — or more than one in 10 people in the US. This weekend, for the first time, reflecting their boom product, NBC have transported their entire Premier League production from their HQ in Stamford, Connecticut, to England. NBC host Rebecca Lowe has helped to improve coverage of the Premier League in America . Star anchor Lowe was at Turf Moor to present Burnley's Premier League match against Arsenal . Lowe was joined by former Wimbledon midfielder Robbie Earle and retired MLS star Kyle Martino . Lifelong Crystal Palace fan Lowe is married to former Cheltenham manager Paul Buckle . Star anchor Rebecca Lowe was at Turf Moor for Burnley against Arsenal, joined by former USA midfielder Kyle Martino — a pin-up at LA Galaxy just before David Beckham — and fellow pundit Robbie Earle, now based in Los Angeles. The trio, plus pitchside analysts Lee Dixon and Robbie Mustoe, will also be at the Manchester derby at Old Trafford on Sunday and at Anfield for Liverpool-Newcastle on Monday. ‘The Premier League sells itself with its drama,’ says Lowe, 34, a former BBC and ESPN journalist snapped up to be the face of the PL in the USA by NBC two years ago. ‘But you can always enhance your coverage and that’s why we’re here this weekend.’ Lowe herself is a lifelong Crystal Palace fan, and had one eye on their stunning 4-1 win at Sunderland. As she told the LA Times recently, tongue in cheek, her support of Palace is not a sign that she can’t recognise good football. ‘I hope that people look at me and say she actually knows football because to be a Crystal Palace fan, you have to really want to be in football,’ she said. ‘It’s not easy being a Crystal Palace fan. I could pick United or City or Chelsea or Arsenal and I probably would have had a much happier childhood.’ Lowe now finds herself helping to influence the footballing choices of young Americans. ‘When I first moved to the States two years ago I hardly saw a [replica] Premier League shirt,’ she says. ‘Now they’re all over the place, and not just the big teams.’ Lowe was at Turf Moor to see Arsenal claim all three points thanks to a goal by Aaron Ramsey . Lee Dixon provided pitchside analysis for NBC as his former side defeated relegation candidates Burnley . NBC transported their entire Premier League production from their HQ in Stamford, Connecticut, to England for this weekend's round of matches . Every match is shown live in the USA. At 7am eastern time on Saturday, midday in Britain, NBC’s weekend PL broadcasting opened with a long shot of Turf Moor set against the Lancashire hills and Lowe describing how football has been played at this ground since 1883. ‘This country is so rich in history, it’s part of the appeal,’ says Lowe, a Londoner who is married to football manager Paul Buckle, who recently parted company with Cheltenham. ‘It’s important that we do tell our audience about [smaller clubs like] Burnley because otherwise it could all be Arsenal, United, City, Chelsea, Liverpool,’ Lowe says. ‘We’re passionate about educating and informing our audience.’ Martino says that when NBC won the rights to show games — for the three-year period, 2013-16, for $250 million (£167m) — some critics feared that showing every match ‘was going to be overkill … [but] what we’ve found is there is a demand for that level of consumption of this product’. The USA is the third most lucrative market now for the League in rights terms, among 84 separate overseas contracts covering 212 territories. Only Thailand, where broadcasters are paying $320m for the current three years and the Middle East (both £213m), offer richer pickings, so far. With the Premier League having recently sealed their record £5bn domestic TV deal for 2016-19 with Sky and BT, attention will now turn to all the overseas deals, to be brokered over the next year. India will be a key market, with a surging middle-class interest, while Malaysia, Indonesia and Brazil are seen as having room for growth, among others. All the overseas rights combined fetched £2.23bn for the League for the 2013-16 period (or £743m a year) with increases expected. The USA is high on the list of places the League want to continue building interest, not just to earn more TV cash but to provide the clubs with potentially lucrative markets. Burnley’s chief executive Lee Hoos, an American, told the Mail on Sunday on Saturday that his club’s merchandise sales in the USA have jumped 212 per cent this season simply by being in the League. Leaps of 150 per cent have been recorded in places as far flung as Korea and mainland Europe. Lowe would have been delighted with Crystal Palace's emphatic 4-1 league win over Sunderland . Burnley have benefitted from the American audience taking an interest in the Premier League, says Lee Hoos . Burnley chief Hoos, pictured withSportsmail's Nick Harris, insists his club's profile is high across the globe . Arsenal chief executive Ivan Gazidis has been impressed with NBC's coverage of the Premier League . ‘There are still people here in the UK who will say to me, “Where exactly is Burnley?”,’ he says. ‘Yet our profile has never been higher internationally.’ Arsenal’s chief executive Ivan Gazidis, who spent 16 years in MLS, said NBC’s coverage has been ‘transformative’ for the Premier League. He said in the recent past football was seen as ‘niche’ and ‘nerdy’ and ‘it was always cool to knock soccer … but when you get NBC coming into play you’re moving into the mainstream. It’s a sea change’. Three of the four most-watched Premier League games ever in the USA, including the No 1 match, Manchester United versus Arsenal in November, have been during NBC’s current deal. The biggest audience averaged 1.41m people — and that was before breakfast in many cities. The average audience in Britain for a Premier League match across Sky Sport and BT is little more than a million (and almost 500,000 in the US) and the biggest ever audience on Sky averaged below 3 million. United's win over Liverpool attracted 1.2 million on NBC cable and Spanish partner UNIVERSO combined . Manchester United's 2-1 win at the Emirates Stadium in November was the most-watched PL game in the US . Liverpool’s defeat by Manchester United last month had an average audience of 1.2 million on NBC cable and Spanish partner UNIVERSO combined. That made it the most-watched PL game screened before 10am in US history. The growth of the interest in America means numbers will swell there, with Martino believing phenomenal increases are likely. ‘NBC cover the Olympics, the NFL, they have been covering the big event for a very long time,’ he says. ‘It’s natural for them. It’s the same template [being used to market the Premier League]. ‘In the United States we talk about the NFL getting 19 million on a Monday night. That’s the bar set. And it’s not hyperbole to be ambitious — that’s what’s going to happen one day with the Premier League.’Liverpool’s defeat by Manchester United last month had an average audience of 1.2 million on NBC cable and Spanish partner UNIVERSO combined. That made it the most-watched PL game screened before 10am in US history. Jon Miller, NBC Sports’ president of programming, said: ‘The Premier League has a very passionate fan base here in the US. It’s also a youthful and affluent fan base as well, relative to other sports on television. ‘We have created a new “day part” in weekend morning television, where fans now come to our networks beginning at 7 in the morning and stay for 5-6 hours. It’s been a terrific partnership. ‘We believe that this is best soccer being played anywhere in the world and Americans gravitate towards the best when available.’","Rebecca Lowe has helped to enhance Premier League coverage in the US .

"Former Manchester United midfielder Eric Cantona has refuted claims he starred in a soft porn film, insisting You and the Night is a 'piece of art'. The French film has a number of racy scenes, and at one point sees Cantona on his hands and knees in just his underwear. But the 48-year-old is adamant it is not pornography. Speaking at the Laureus Sports Awards in Shanghai, Cantona said: 'Porn? No, it's not porn. It's a piece of art. It's just a piece of art. But you can see it like this.

Cantona has defended the film, saying it is 'a work of art' and 'beautiful', and not a porn film as some have said . In one scene, Cantona is on his hands and knees in his pants while a woman with a whip stands over him . Cantona stars alongside French actress Beatrice Dalle, playing a character named 'The Stud', and the film has been both praised and slated in equal measure.

"(CNN)Two deputies involved in the fatal attempt to arrest Eric Harris in Tulsa, Oklahoma, have been reassigned because of threats against them and their families, Sheriff Stanley Glanz said Monday in a news conference. The deputies were trying to arrest Harris when Reserve Deputy Robert Bates shot him. Unlike Bates, they are not charged with a crime, but have come under criticism for pinning Harris' head to the ground as he said, ""I'm losing my breath."" Police appear on video saying, ""F*ck your breath,"" apparently in response. Sheriff Stanley Glanz didn't specify the nature of the threats, but said he was ""very concerned"" for their safety and that of their families. He did not say what the deputies had been assigned to do. Another sheriff's official said the office has temporarily suspended operations of the agency's drug unit pending the review of the April 2 shooting of Harris following a weapons sting. Glanz indicated he has not yet decided how to proceed with a review of their actions, saying any action may be delayed until after the court case involving Bates has been settled. Bates is charged with second-degree manslaughter in Harris' death. Bates, who is free on $25,000 bond pending trial, shot Harris with his handgun after calling out, ""Taser, Taser,"" -- an indication he planned to use a stun gun to subdue Harris following a brief foot chase with the other deputies. Amid questions about his age -- 73 -- training and friendship with Glanz, Bates has said the shooting was accidental, and has apologized to the family. Lawyer releases training records for Tulsa deputy charged in killing . On Monday, Glanz also apologized to Harris' family. ""We are sorry Eric was taken from you,"" he said. But he said his office holds itself to the highest national standards of policing, and said Monday that the FBI had cleared the agency of any civil rights violations in the shooting. Bates is white. Harris was black. There have been allegations, first reported by the Tulsa World newspaper, that some of Bates' training records had been forged, or that he was unqualified to be serving on the force. The sheriff denied those allegations, saying he was certain Bates had qualified on the gun range and had extensive additional training. He said he was unaware of any forgery involving training records, and said he had not issued any training waivers for Bates, with whom he has been friends for more than two decades. But he said he supported prosecutor's decision to proceed with the case. He also said he had brought in a Dallas police consultant who had previously examined the office's policies and procedures for another look. Harris' family has said the shooting reveals ""a deep-seated problem"" within the department and has demanded justice, and changes in policy.","Deputies reassigned after threats, sheriff says .

"Manhattan's Fifth Avenue was a sea of bizarre hats today as people celebrating Easter took to the streets in outlandish headgear. Whether they had just emerged from Mass, or were only there to bare their bonnets, the quintessential Big Apple thoroughfare thronged with color on Sunday afternoon. Bunny ears, eggs and flowers were among the more conservative adornments festooning the heads of New Yorkers as they milled around in a loose gaggle centered on St Patrick's Cathedral. Mad hatters: These parader-goers, pictured in front of St Patrick's Cathedral on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue, were among the more conservative hat-wearers in the annual Easter parade . Flower power: One of these floral bonnets, pictured next to the Rockefeller Plaza, spouted bubbles into the sunny New York sky . Classic: Some churchgoers wore more somber and refined clothing to the Mass service at the Catholic cathedral . Feathery: This elaborate piece of headgear was sported by Doris Watlington at the Fifth Avenue parade on Sunday . One woman wore a large ship with blue sails on her head, while another sported an elaborate diorama based on the policies of Mayor Bill de Blasio. As well as Christians emerging from the service, led by Cardinal Timothy Dolan, Jews, Hindus, agnostics and atheists joined the masses for a walk on the mild, sunny day. Roses, industrial-style black goggles, as well as moving rabbit puppets also featured in the display, which didn't just involve humans. Mary Ann Smith, a local hatmaker who wore the ship-shaped hat, said: 'It's all about versatility'. Explaining the design, she said: 'It's about sailing to new heights,' said Smith. She also created headpieces for two friends, one topped with a massive butterfly and another with a tropical umbrella dripping with felt balls and anchored to a bird's nest. Just feet from the parade, the trio was tending to last-minute finishing touches, adding bobby pins to make sure the contraptions didn't topple. Kirsten Lee Sergeant, who wore the butterfly, said: 'It's Easter and I didn't want to be too garish. But then again, I do have a huge butterfly on my head!' Ship-shape: Hat-maker Mary Anna Smith wears an Easter bonnet featuring a blue ship, which she fashioned from an elaborate kite . Elaborate rabbit: This puppet bunny was another of the out-there headpieces seen strutting down Fifth Avenue . Commentary: This woman's hat was a diorama inspired by the city's mayor, Bill de Blasio . Starting young: Maelie Swanson, held by her father Jeff, enjoyed the chance to put her bunny ears on parade . Onesie becomes twosie: This rabbit enthusiast was captured next to a mirrored building on the New York street . In bloom: These colorful headpieces were typical among the revelers . Eggstravagant: These two women took the egg theme to its logical conclusion, wearing depictions in cooked and raw form . The 2015 Easter Parade bore little resemblance to the first one, which started in the 1880s as a strolling display of what prosperous New Yorkers wore to Fifth Avenue churches. In recent decades, the street gathering has morphed into a sort of costume circus - including pet dogs. A sizable subsection of dogs also sported elaborate Easter costumes, painstakingly designed by their owners - although some were so heavy they animals had to be carried around rather than walk. Carmen, a 4lbs Chihuahua, was not exactly happy with her getup. 'She didn't love this one because it's kind of heavy, and she won't walk in it. But if I carry her, she's fine,' said owner Melissa Mejias. A consultant to the city's Department of Education, Mejias dabbles in dog attire. She used a Simplicity pattern to sew Carmen's coat from one of her old shirts, adorning it with a flowery headband plus a necklace purchased from a company that makes accessories for tweens. And to make sure she didn't run off into the dense crowds, Mejias kept her on a bejeweled leash. As for Mejias, she wore her mother-in-law's old Easter hat to the parade, a dark red velvet one she'd pulled out of a closet. 'I'm carrying on that tradition,' said Mejias. Dog squad: Carmen the Chihuahua poses with owneer Melissa Mejias at the parade. She was apparently not a big fan of the floral outfit, and won't walk with it on .

"The Emirates Airline logo will be a familiar sight for sports fans across the world. On Tuesday, Sportsmail revealed that the Dubai-based brand are set to seal an historic deal with the FA Cup which would see football's oldest knockout competition rebranded as the Emirates FA Cup. The £30million three-year deal would add to Emirates' ever-increasing portfolio of sporting sponsorship. Here, Sportsmail takes a look at the current deals the famous airline has on the table. Arsenal won last season's FA Cup competition, which will be rebranded the Emirates FA Cup . EMIRATES’ SPORT PORTFOLIO . FOOTBALL . Arsenal and the Emirates Stadium . Deal worth: £150million . Arsenal signed the biggest club sponsorship agreement in English football history in 2004 after signing a 15-year deal worth £100million with the Dubai-based international airline. The agreement provided Emirates with naming rights to Arsenal's 60,000 seat stadium and a place on the club's shirt as the slogan 'Fly Emirates' took over from Arsenal's previous sponsors O2 in an eight-year deal starting from the 2006-07 Premier League season. In December 2012, a new £150m deal was agreed, keeping the partnership together until the end of the 2018-19 season. Arsenal's new home was named the Emirates Stadium after a big-money deal in 2004 . The £100million agreement provided Emirates with naming rights to Arsenal's 60,000 seat stadium . The Emirates Cup . The pre-season friendly tournament began in 2007 and is hosted at Arsenal's Emirates Stadium. During that time, teams such as Real Madrid, Inter Milan and Juventus graced the turf to take part in two friendly matches each in a bid to win the tournament. The Emirates Cup is broadcast by BT Sport in the UK as well as in a number of countries across the globe, maximising coverage for the airline. Arsenal Soccer Schools, Dubai . A joint venture between Emirates and Arsenal, the Dubai soccer schools were established in 2009 and are sponsored by the airline. They are open to boys and girls of all ages and take place at the Emirates' owned 7he Sevens sporting venue. Alexis Sanchez (left) in action during an Emirates Cup clash between Arsenal and Monaco in August . AC Milan . Deal worth: £80m . Emirates stretched their influence to Italian football in 2010 after sealing a £52m four-year deal with giants AC Milan. In 2014, the Serie A side renewed the big-money deal with the famous airline, stretching their sponsorship until the 2019-20 season. Th new five-year deal was reportedly worth around £80m, while the new agreement also includes branding around Milan’s San Siro Stadium, sponsorship of the club’s youth team and additional marketing rights. Emirates stretched their influence to Italian football in 2010 after sealing a £52m four-year deal with AC Milan . Hamburg . Deal worth: £17m . Hamburg's relationship with Emirates began in 2006 after the Bundesliga outfit agreed a three-year deal worth £11m. In February 2012, the deal was renewed for a further three years with an option to extend the partnership through to 2016. The reported £5m-a-year deal sees the Emirates brand printed on the club shirts as well as dotted around Hamburg's Imtech Arena. Bundesliga outfit Hamburg have been in partnership with Emirates since 2006 . New York Cosmos . Deal worth: £5m . The New York Cosmos joined the likes of Arsenal and Real Madrid by signing a deal with the fast-growing airline in 2013. The Emirates logo adorns the famous green and white shirts once worn by Brazilian legend Pele and will do until at least 2018 after a two-year extension was agreed last year. The Cosmos have reportedly been earning around £1million-a-year from the deal. NY Cosmos honourary president Pele (second right) with the shirt after the club agree a deal with Emirates . Paris Saint-Germain . Deal worth: £90m . PSG players have worn the Emirates brand since 2006 when the shirt sponsorship officially began for a relatively small fee of £3.5m-per-year. Following the French club's recent successes, a new deal estimated to be worth around £18m-per-season was drawn up taking their partnership with Emirates to 2018. According to media reports, the £90m agreement means PSG's deal is significantly below the more lucrative shirt sponsorship deals in the Premier League. Edinson Cavani celebrates in PSG's 'Fly Emirates' sponsored shirt, which has been in place since 2006 . Real Madrid . Deal worth: £105m . In 2013, Emirates secured the signatures of one of the world's biggest football clubs by agreeing a five-year shirt sponsorship deal with Real Madrid. No official figures were released for the sponsorship deal which is reported  to be worth up to 21m-a-year. The airline deal brought Madrid closer to arch-rivals Barcelona who have a shirt sponsorship agreement with the Qatar Foundation worth around £20m-a-season until 2016. Cristiano Ronaldo's Real Madrid signed sealed a lucrative deal with Emirates in 2013 . Asian Football Confederation .

"A series of unpublished love letters from Mexican artist Frida Kahlo to her lover Jose Bartoli are expected to fetch upwards of $120,000 when the passionate missives go up for auction later this . During her marriage to muralist Diego Rivera, Frida penned the letters to Jose, a Catalan artist whom she met while she was recovering from surgery in New York. Their steamy correspondence began shortly after she returned to Mexico following the trip and continued throughout their secret three-year romance. 'I don’t know how to write love letters. But I wanted to tell you that my whole being opened for you,' then-39-year-old Frida wrote in October of 1946. Scroll down for video . Secret romance: Mexican artist Frida Kahlo (pictured) wrote passionate love letters to Jose Bartoli from 1946 and 1949 while she was married to muralist Diego Rivera . Enduring love: A collection of 25 of the unpublished letters will be auctioned off at Doyle New York on April 15 . She continued: 'Since I fell in love with you everything is transformed and is full of beauty… love is like an aroma, like a current, like rain.' The letters, 25 of which are headed to auction at Doyle New York on April 15, were written in Spanish between August 1946 and November 1949 and saved by Jose until his death in 1995. The archive of passionate messages, which comprise more than 100 pages, were passed down through different generations his family until they reached the current owner. According to Frida Kahlo biographer Hayden Herrera, the artist told Jose to sign his letters as 'Sonja' so that Diego would think they were from a woman if he came across them. High price: The letters (pictured) are expected to fetch upwards of $120,000 dollars . Pet names: Frida signed her letters to Jose 'Mara', which biographer Hayden Herrera explained is probably short for 'Maravillosa', a name Jose would call her . Creative couple: Jose, a Catalan artist, can be seen sitting at an easel as he works on a painting . Handle with care: This letter from the archive shows a stain on the right hand corner of the paper . Famous works: In this letter, Frida refers to 'Tree of Hope', a painting she created shortly after she met Jose . Diego, a muralist and a notorious Lothario, who once had an affair with Frida's younger sister Cristina, endured Frida's love affairs with women, but her relationships with other men would drive him to bouts of crazed jealousy. Meanwhile, Frida inscribed her letters with the name 'Mara', which Hayden explained is probably short for 'Maravillosa', a name Jose would call her. The collection also includes an original drawing of a sleeping cat, pressed flowers, ribbon, beads and drafts of a few of Jose's responses. Frida's candid messages to her lover shed light on her important paintings, an unknown pregnancy and her relationship with Diego, as well as her adoration for her Jose. Full package: The letters also include an original drawing of a sleeping cat and drafts of a few of Jose's responses . Sketch artist: Frida sent Jose this drawing of a tree in reference to 'The Tree of Life' City living: Frida posed for this photo in front of a skyline. She and Jose met when she was recovering from surgery in a hospital in New York . Long distance love: Frida ended this letter to Jose with a kiss, leaving behind a lipstick print of her mouth . Their secret affair began when Frida, who was left a partial cripple after a 1925 bus accident, was recovering from a spinal fusion performed in June, 1946 at New York’s Hospital for Special Surgery. Frida's sister Cristina was the one to introduce her to Jose, who moved to New York after fighting in the Spanish Civil War. They fell in love during his visits to the hospital and continued their long-distance courtship after she returned to Mexico. After Frida sold her 1946 painting Tree of Hope, which was inspired by her recent surgery, she wrote to Jose about his words influenced her creation. 'I remembered your last words and I began to paint,' she explained. 'I worked all morning and when I finished eating I kept on painting until there was no more light. But afterward I felt so tired and everything hurt.' An artist's life: Frida was photographed holding this statue while she stood in front of a blue cement wall . Inspired work: Frida sketched this drawing of a sleeping cat and sent it to Jose . Added images: This letter featured a picture of a women sleeping in a bed while another walked away . Last words: Frida ends this letter by telling Jose that she loves him . Epic romance: In this letter Frida told Jose she loves him the way that he is . In the painting one version of Frida lies in a hospital bed, while another depiction of herself sits proudly while holding a flag. While painting the piece, Frida inscribed 'Tree of Hope Keep Firm' a line of a song that she and Jose both liked. According to Hayden, Frida wrote in several of her letters to Jose that she had missed her period, in a way that suggested she was in some ways hoping to have his baby despite knowing it was nearly impossible because of her spinal injury. 'If I were not in the condition I am in now and if it were a reality, nothing in my life would give me more joy. Can you imagine a little Bartoli or a Mara?' she wrote. New images: Frida posed in her house for this photo take by French photographer Gisèle Freund . Full of life: Frida can be seen standing in her garden in Mexico in this image shot by Gisèle . Meta moment: Frida Kahlo and Dr Juan Farill were photographed in her home in 1951.

"Following Raheem Sterling's interview on Wednesday, in which he said he was not ready to sign a new contract at Liverpool, blogger David Tyrer of Live4Liverpool gives the view from Merseyside. While I hate to use social media as a gauge of opinions, Raheem Sterling’s interview didn’t go down well at all. It was ill-timed and, regardless of what Sterling and his agent hoped, he didn’t come across very well. Some of his answers only fuelled the fire really. I’m hoping that that wasn’t the whole point, as we’ve seen these sorts of situations engineered by agents before. The interview has almost certainly changed the way the fans feel about him. There will be a lot of fans that are of the opinion: ‘let him go’. Obviously, with the caveat that we get our money’s worth! Raheem Sterling returns to Liverpool training after the international break and shakes hands with manager Brendan Rodgers . Sterling risked angering Liverpool fans after he said in an interview he was not ready to sign a contract . Sterling trains ahead of the weekend's game with Arsenal . It’s always disappointing when a young player gets his head turned, but there’s a sense of ungratefulness about the whole situation, considering how the club has nurtured him and paid him well throughout. Personally, I think he has the potential to be worth so much more than the £100,000-a-week contract he’s turned down. But it’s only that: potential. At present, he’s arguably in the top five best young players in the world but, obviously at his age, he’s also prone to bouts of inconsistency and prolonged poor form. He hasn’t been great recently and was awful against Man Utd. Sterling has been linked with a move to Arsenal - the team he is preparing to face at the weekend . Raheem Sterling played for England in the 4-0 Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania . And while I’d be willing to see the club give him £100k a week – possibly £120k a week - the club shouldn’t do everything it can to keep him. Definitely not. Liverpool fans have a popular mantra: no player is bigger than the club. Admittedly, we stretch the rules for truly great players (Suarez, a recent example) but Sterling is nowhere near. If he wants out, I’m sure the club will handle it the way they have before. Frustration over Sterling’s situation has been building for a while, and many fans are now of the belief that if he wants to go he’s welcome to. Personally, I don’t like players holding the club to ransom. He has as much chance of winning trophies here as he does anywhere (other than money-rich clubs such as Chelsea or Man City). Sterling did not have his best game in a Liverpool shirt during the defeat at Manchester United . Liverpool fans have a mantra that no player is bigger than the club . If Sterling was to move to Arsenal then it would not go down well with Liverpool fans . But if he does end up going, he’s worth a lot more than many established players. His ability is so raw but he has almost limitless potential. At the moment, we’ve seen it in fits and starts but even so, he’s easily worth £25-30 million. If I was FSG, I’d hold any interested club to ransom, though – double it. But a move to Arsenal wouldn’t go down well. Perhaps better than if it was Chelsea or Manchester United, but honestly there’s little Arsenal can offer that we can’t. Sure, they’re more financially stable but what – in terms of trophies – do Arsenal have to show for the last 12 years? Sterling speaks to the BBC and reveals he is not ready to sign a new contract . I think we’re somewhat ahead on that front. Much like Alexis Sanchez, any move to Arsenal will be more about location than anything else. People have drawn comparisons with when Suarez wanted to leave for Arsenal, but the situation is different. Suarez says he wanted Champions League football and we weren’t offering that at that time. Not only that, but Suarez was an established top-class player at the time, one of the best in the world. Sterling is purely potential and, given all the club have done for him (cliched, as that sounds), it makes little sense. If he’s going to be nurtured into the world-class talent he can become, it won’t happen at Arsenal. It may not necessarily happen at Anfield either, but a manager like Brendan Rodgers will give him the best shot of improving to that level over the next two to three years.

"An 11-year-old retired K-9 officer took his last ride in a squad car in a heartwarming farewell held by fellow officers and residents celebrating his time on the force. Zeus, a German Shepherd, was honored in a grand procession in Connecticut on Wednesday before he was put down because of a severe degenerative hip disorder and declining health. The tribute for the police dog, who worked with the Ridgefield Police Department for eight years as a K-9 officer, began around 4.45pm and ended at the Ridgefield Veterinary Hospital. Scroll down for video . Zeus (pictured above), an 11-year-old retired K-9 officer was honored in a special tribute on Wednesday by the Ridgefield Police Department . The German Shepherd, who served eight years in the force, took his last ride in a cop patrol car during the grand procession held earlier this week (Zeus pictured with Officer Shawn Murray, his former partner and carer after he retired) On Wednesday, ahead of the procession, the police department wrote an emotional message about Zeus on their Facebook. 'Today is the day we have to say goodbye to our beloved K-9 Zeus,' they wrote. 'It is an extremely emotional day for all of us. 'He was a fellow officer and friend. He will be deeply missed but never forgotten. Our thoughts and prayers are with Zeus, Officer Murray and his family during this difficult time.' During the grand procession, residents of Ridgefield lined the streets as they watched the cop cars drive by through the streets of the town. Zeus had the special tribute before he was put down because of a severe degenerative hip disorder and declining health (Zeus pictured during the procession on Wednesday) Officers from the department and police departments across the state came to pay their tributes . Zeus was being taken to Ridgefield Veterinary Clinic (above) where he was to be euthanized . The vehicles traveled from the police headquarter and ended at the veterinary hospital. Residents held signs reading 'Thank you Zeus' and 'Zeus our hero during the afternoon. A flag was waved at half staff next to a draped black cloth at the department as Officer Shawn Murray, Zeus's former partner, pushed him in a cart during the tribute. 'This is an honor to be here for him during his last moments,' Chief John Roche told WTNH. 'The disease that had racked him had deteriorated to such a point where it was just so difficult for him to exist and continue on.' A flag was waved at half staff next to a draped black cloth at the department (pictured above) Chief John Roche (above) said during the tribute: 'This is an honor to be here for him during his last moments' In his eight-year career with the force, Zeus assisted with more than 250 narcotics arrest and also helped officers track down 50 missing or wanted individuals. The largest amount of narcotics he was responsible for seizing was ten pounds of marijuana in 2006, when he joined the force and was partnered with Officer  Murray who he continued to reside with after his retirement. The animal had to retire last May due to health issues, and for some losing Zeus is not only losing a coworker, but also a family member. 'He was in the yard when there were picnics,' Detective Scott Murray, Officer Murray's brother told WTNH. 'He played, he chased the ball, he did what all normal dogs do, what all normal family dogs do, except he had a job.' Following the special tribute, the police department wrote their final goodbye to Zeus. On Wednesday, the police department wrote an emotional goodbye to Zeus thanking him for keeping them safe . The police department said it was an honor to work beside Zeus. During his eight-year career with the force, the dog assisted with over 250 narcotics arrests (his badge pictured right) Ridgefield Police Department officers said: 'You will be dearly missed but never forgotten' 'Zeus, it is with tears in our eyes that we must say goodbye,' they wrote. 'You were a valued member of our team and only did great things. 'It was an honor to work beside you and knowing that you were there always helped put our minds at ease. 'We know you would not have hesitated to lay down your life for any of us if we were ever faced with a life threatening situation. You wore the Ridgefield Police badge with Respect, Pride and Dignity. 'Thank you for keeping us all safe over the years. You will be dearly missed but never forgotten.

"Earlier this week, Brazilian commuter Nelson Felippe was deeply offended by a scene he witnessed on a train platform. He proceeded to take a photo, and express his disapproval on Facebook, after which the image was shared more than 100,000 times in 24 hours. In the picture, taken on a train platform in Rio de Janeiro, two women hug and gaze into each others' eyes, but the source of his outrage soon becomes clear in a post that cleverly spoofs conservative attitudes. Brazilian man, Nelson Felippe posted this image, expressing his disapproval at the 'scene'. The viewer believes he is conducting a homophobic rant, as he mentions: 'They are challenging social conventions, and this can be dangerous' In his Facebook post, Felippe stated: 'I am not prejudiced, I think everyone does what they want out of your life. But I find it absurd that I should be forced to witness a scene like this. 'What one does in private is your business, but what you do in public concerns me yes. And I refuse to see a scene like this and consider it normal.' A man breaks safety regulations by standing with his foot on the yellow line . 'I do not wish ill of anyone, but people should be preserved. [They] are challenging social conventions, and this can be dangerous. Continuing with what the unknowing reader assumes at this point is a homophobic rant, the next part of the post starts to become confusing. 'If after a tragedy strikes, or worse, if someone dies, who will put the blame on who? On me? Worst of all is the example for children. Suddenly it becomes clear what Felippe, who works at the Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, is really warning against - with his tongue firmly in this cheek. 'What would happen to a child who sees this scene every day? 'Kids will think it's normal to wait for the subway on the yellow line. So, don't act like that guy over there. 'Follow the example of the girls.' It seems the Brazilian commuter was in fact observing a public transport safety regulation, which the man in the far top-right is clearly breaking. Felippe warns others not to follow in the delinquent man's footsteps. The post has received thousands of comments with users applauding his witty way of exposing homophobia. Leando Da Silver wrote: 'Great text. Shows that do not need to be boring to combat homophobia.' Celia Rodrigues added: 'There are people that judge before concluding the reading.'","Image shows two women hugging among commuters on a train platform .

"Meter Maids have a long history synonymous with the sandy beaches of Queensland's most sought-after holiday destination, but time may have run out for the Surfers Paradise bikini-clad icons. The 50-year tradition has split the Gold Coast community, with business leaders calling for the end of an era, The Sunday Mail reported. Started in 1965, Meter Maids were the brainchild of Gold Coast developer Bernie Elsey who introduced the initiative to stave off the bad publicity associated with newly installed parking meters. Scroll down for video . Local business owners have labelled Surfers Paradise Meter Maids as outdated and were no longer providing a service . The controversial move involved young women dressed in gold bikinis walking the main tourist strip and placing money into expired meters, according to the Surfers Paradise Meter Maids website. But local business owners say the group is no longer performing a public service as advancements in parking meter technology mean expiry times are not always displayed. They believe Meter Maids are violating the council's anti-touting laws by spruiking branded merchandise, which Gold Coast Chamber of Commerce president Peter Yared says makes the group a business now. 'I think it’s time they moved on,' he told News Corp. Started in 1965, Meter Maids were the brainchild of Gold Coast developer Bernie Elsey who introduced the initiative to stave off the bad publicity associated with the newly installed parking meters . Business leaders say it was time for them to move as they had became irrelevant now because parking meters were electronic . Gold Coast Chamber of Commerce's Peter Yared said the group were now a business . 'They no longer perform any service for the community... They don't do anything in the area except fleece tourists.' Mr Yared said Meter Maids were no longer relevant as parking meters were now electronic and they had not kept up with the changing times. 'We're trying to clean up the reputation of Surfers Paradise and a lot of the maids are foreign backpackers rather than local girls. It’s not a good look,' he said. But Surfers Paradise Meter Maids general manager Michael Yarwood told Daily Mail Australia the chamber of commerce was taking 'a terribly ill-informed position'. 'The tourists love and embrace the Meter Maids because they are quintessentially part of their Gold Coast and Surfers Paradise experience,' Mr Yarwood said. 'The great tragedy at Surfers Paradise is reflected in its concrete virility and the fact that the locals are staying away in droves. But Surfers Paradise Meter Maids general manager Michael Yarwood told Daily Mail Australia said the chamber of commerce was taking 'a terribly ill-informed position' Mr Yarwood said the Meter Maids were 'quinessentially' part of the Gold Coast and Surfers Paradise scene . He said they brought good memories for many people who had an idyllic beachside holiday at the destination . 'Until such time we are proud of this jewel in our tourism crown, we will continue to struggle to re-establish ourselves as the premier holiday destination in Australia.' Mr Yarwood said Meter Maids were the 'under-utilised resource' to help revamp the region. 'Meter Maids invoke in most people that wonderful memory of that beachside holiday in Surfers Paradise,' he said. 'We're calling for our future actually lies in past. 'I'm Gold Coast born and bred... and I am ashamed to take clients in to Surfers Paradise because it is unsafe and unclean. 'We [The Meter Maids] are the only bit of sunshine.

"An Oklahoma jury today convicted a 17-year-old of first-degree murder in the shooting death of an Australian college baseball player who was killed while out for a jog. The Stephens County jury found Chancey Allen Luna guilty in the August 16, 2013, death of Christopher Lane, who was shot in the back while running along a city street in Duncan. The jury recommended that Luna be sentenced to life in prison without parole. Defense attorneys acknowledged that Luna fired the fatal shot from a passing car that he was riding in, but contended that he meant only to scare Lane. Scroll down fro video . Killer look: Chancey Luna (left), 17, is led from the courtroom to the jail in shackles and handcuffs after being convicted in the 2013 shooting death of Australian baseball player Christopher Lane (right) Heading for lockup: The jury recommended that Luna be sentenced to life in prison without parole . Belated apology: As he was being led out of the courtroom, Luna told reporters he was 'sorry' Reckless: Luna's defense lawyer contended that the teen meant only to scare Lane when he shot at him from a moving car . 'There was no motive, no plan to kill anyone,' defense attorney Jim Berry said during opening statements. 'This is a reckless action by a 16-year-old child.' The defense had asked that the jury be allowed to consider a second-degree murder conviction, a request that the judge denied earlier Friday. Second-degree murder would have carried a sentence of 10 years to life in prison. Luna did not testify and the defense called just one witness, Luna's mother, Jennifer Luna. In her brief testimony, Jennifer Luna said her son lived with her parents after he was born and that his father is in jail. 'I wasn't there half the time,' she said. She also insisted from the witness stand that her boy would never hurt anyone intentionally. 'If my son did it, it wasn't on purpose. It wasn't meant to be. My son would never intentionally try to hurt somebody at all.' Dressed in a blue button-down shirt and a striped tie, Chancey Luna was stoned-faced when the jurors announced the guilty verdict. Satisfied: Donna Lane, left, the victim's mother, was pleased with the verdict, saying in reference to Luna that the 'naughty boy' will never hurt another family again . Comfort: The family of murdered Melbourne baseball player Chris Lane (From left) sister Erin hugs Chris's girlfriend Sarah Harper (blonde) after the US court verdict in Duncan, Friday, April 17, 2015 . Devastated: Sarah Harper, the girlfriend of the Australian murder victim, arrives for court in the trial of Chancey Luna Friday . Jennifer Luna, Chancey's mother picture din court Friday, testified that her son would never hurt someone intentionally . However, as he was being led in handcuffs and shackles out of the courtroom, the teenager told a swarm of reporters he was 'sorry.' Lane's parents and sister, who had read heartbreaking victim impact statements before the verdict was announced, expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the trial. 'This naughty boy is never going to do this to any other family,' Donna Lane told the media, according to Sydney Morning News. A co-defendant in the case, James 'Bug' Edwards Jr., now 17, testified that he was a passenger in the car when it swerved toward Lane, and Luna fired the shot. Edwards testified as part of a plea agreement in which a first-degree murder charge against him was reduced to being an accessory after the fact. Parents: Donna Lane, pictured left in court Thursday wiped tears from her face when prosecutors showed jurors a photo of the bloody T-shirt her son was wearing. Jennifer Luna (right) said her son lived with her parents and she was not there 'half the time' The car's driver, Michael Jones, now 19, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder as part of a plea bargain, but refused to testify for the prosecution. He is serving a life sentence with the possibility of parole. The doctor who performed the autopsy on Lane testified that even immediate medical attention would not have saved his life. 'Apart from a miracle, no,' said Dr. Inas Yacoub, a forensic pathologist with the state medical examiner's office. Yacoub testified that a .22-caliber bullet was recovered from Lane's body. Star-crossed lovers: Luna and his American girlfriend, Sarah Harper, had returned from a trip to Australia just two days before he was gunned down while out jogging . Torn apart: Lane, from Melbourne, Australia, was visiting his girlfriend, Sarah Harper, and her family in Duncan when he was killed . 'Despite being small, it damaged vital structures and caused significant bleeding,' Yacoub told jurors, striking two major blood vessels, puncturing both lungs and breaking two ribs. The victim's mother, Donna Lane, wiped tears from her face when prosecutors showed jurors a photo of the bloody T-shirt her son was wearing. Lane and family members also wept during testimony by witnesses who tried to comfort Lane as he lay dying. Lane, from Melbourne, Australia, was in Oklahoma on a college baseball scholarship. He was a catcher and preparing for his senior year at East Central University in Ada and was visiting his girlfriend and her family in Duncan when he was shot.","Oklahoma jury convicted 17-year-old Chancey Allen Luna of first-degree murder in 2013 killing of Christopher Lane .

"A giant supervoid 1.8 billion light-years across may be responsible for a mysterious ‘Cold Spot’ in the universe. The theory was proposed by astronomers seeking to understand what is causing this larger-than-expected cold area. If confirmed, the supervoid would be the largest single structure ever found by humanity. Hawaii scientists say a supervoid may account for an anomaly in the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) of the universe, shown bottom right. In 2004 astronomers first found the 'Cold Spot' - a region 20 per cent less dense than elsewhere - and may now have an explanation for its formation . The research, published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, was carried out by the Institute for Astronomy at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. The Cold Spot was first discovered by astronomers in 2004 when they were examining a map of the radiation left over from the Big Bang - the cosmic microwave background (CMB) - made using Esa's Planck telescope. In the map, the universe is fairly evenly distributed, apart from in this one area. The huge unexpected region contains about 20 per cent less matter than other regions of the universe and about 10,000 less galaxies. While other sparse regions have been discovered, nothing on this scale has been found before. ‘Statistically, we are very confident that the supervoid is there,’ Dr András Kovács, who was involved in the study, told MailOnline. He said that the supervoid appears to be ‘roughly spherical’, and it may even contain a ‘significant substructure’ at its centre; a void within a void. A supervoid is not empty, but rather a region of space that has less matter than other parts of the universe. For this reason it can ‘sap’ the energy of light that is passing through it. To explain how that works, imagine the void to be a hill. As light enters the void and travels towards its middle, it can be said to be climbing the hill, using up energy. Once it passes the centre, it would begin ‘descending’ the hill and regain the energy it expended to get there. But as the universe is expanding, by the time the light gets to the centre, its route out has become ‘shallower’ - or less dense. This means it cannot regain as much energy as it lost initially and leaves the void with less energy, therefore a longer wavelength, which corresponds to a colder temperature. The different is marginal - typically about 70 nano-Kelvins - but it is enough to stand out when the entire cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) of the universe is measured. The supervoid is thought to be causing a 'less-dense' region of the universe (illustration of empty space shown). At 1.8 billion light-years across it would be the biggest object ever found. But some 'exotic physics' is also needed to explain what's happening . The huge unexpected Cold Spot region, shown, contains about 20 per cent less matter than other regions of the universe, and about 10,000 less galaxies. While other sparse regions have been discovered, nothing on this scale has been found before . The original theory was that the Cold Spot originated from the Big Bang, and was a rare sign of 'exotic physics' that our current models of the universe could not explain. This new theory, however, suggests otherwise. Previous attempts to find a void at the distance of the Cold Spot were unsuccessful, but this latest study suggests it is actually a foreground object, three billion light-years from Earth. According to lead researcher Dr Istvan Szapudi, the object - if confirmed - would be ‘the largest individual structure ever identified by humanity.’ The team gathered data using Hawaii’s Pan-Starrs1 (PS1) telescope on Haleakala, Maui, and Nasa’s Wide Field Survey Explorer (Wise) satellite. The findings by the researchers were made using Nasa’s orbiting Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (Wise) telescope (artist's illustration shown), which was launched on 14 December 2009, and Hawaii’s Pan-Starrs1 (PS1) telescope on Haleakala, Maui . However, the supervoid can only account for about half of the entire Cold Spot, suggesting there might still be some exotic physics at play. The researchers note, though, that it is ‘very unlikely’ that the supervoid and the Cold Spot being in the same location are a coincidence. They are continuing to study the void with improved data from PS1, and from the Dark Energy Survey being conducted with the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile.","Hawaii scientists say a supervoid may account for a cosmic anomaly .

"Hassan Munshi, one of two teenagers feared to have crossed into Syria to join ISIS, is believed to be a relative of Hammaad Munshi (pictured) The families of two teenage boys who are thought to have traveled to Syria are 'in a state of profound shock' and deeply worried about the safety of their 'ordinary Yorkshire lads'. The boys who have been named as 17-year-olds Hassan Munshi and Talha Asmal are believed to have traveled to the embattled country after heading to Turkey on March 31. Hassan is supposedly related to Hammaad Munshi, who was arrested by counter-terrorism police at the age of 15 back in 2006. He was later convicted over his role in a brutal plan to murder non-Muslims,The Times reported. A statement released on behalf of the two families said: 'Both families are devastated by the events of the last few days and in particular, we are extremely concerned about the safety and well-being of our loved ones. 'Our number one priority is to get Hassan and Talha back home with their families and we implore anyone who may have any information whatsoever to get in contact with the police. 'Naturally, we are in a state of profound shock and are trying to come to terms with the predicament we find ourselves in and we hope and pray that no other family finds itself in our situation.' The pair from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, have not been in contact with their families for several days and cannot be reached on their mobile phones. Hassan's alleged relative Hammaad was only 15-years-old when he joined a terrifying Islamic State faction who were targeting the Royal Family. Hammaad was arrested on his way home from a chemistry exam in 2006 and found with two bags of ball-bearings - key material for a suicide vest. He was locked up for two years under the Terrorism Act in 2008. The statement added: 'These were just two ordinary Yorkshire lads who enjoyed the things that all young people enjoy at their age. 'Both Hassan and Talha had a promising future as an apprentice and an A-level student respectively, and we are praying they will be back with us soon and are able to realise that future. 'We would implore all parents to be extra vigilant, although as we found, it's near impossible to know your children have been groomed and brainwashed. 'Syria is a frightening war-torn place and we need to urgently educate our young children about the dangers posed by those who prey on impressionable teenagers.' The Times now reports that the two 17-year-old boys told their relatives they were going on a school trip - but instead used the Easter holidays as a 'window of opportunity' to flee Britain. They are thought to have boarded a Thomas Cook flight from Manchester Airport to Dalaman in Turkey on March 31, said West Yorkshire Police. Both families have reported the boys missing to police although British authorities now fear that the pair have managed to cross into Syria from Turkey. Scroll down for video . 'Seeking jihad': Two teenage boys from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, are believed to have fled to Syria to join Isis militants, seen here taking control of the Yarmouk refugee camp in Damascus . A family friend said they were in a state 'of total disbelief' and they were 'broken and inconsolable'. The south Dewsbury area has been linked to a number of extremist plots and was home to the ring-leader of the London bombings on July 7, 2005, Mohammad Sidique Khan. According to The Times, a member of one of the families said: 'We don't want to talk.' Assistant Chief Constable Mark Milsom, from West Yorkshire Police said: 'We are extremely concerned for the safety of these two boys and would urge anyone with information to come forward and speak to us. 'Syria is an extremely dangerous place and the public will be aware of the dangers these boys may face. 'The choice of returning home from Syria is often taken away from those that come under the control of Islamic State, leaving their families in the UK devastated and with very few options to secure their safe return.' The force said it has been supporting the missing teenagers' families and carrying out extensive inquiries alongside the North East Counter Terrorism Unit. The disappearance of the two teenagers follows the arrest of nine Britons by Turkish authorities attempting to sneak into Syria across the Turkish border. The boys are from the same town as London 7/7 suicide bomber Mohammed Siddique Khan (pictured) Waheed Ahmed, 21, from Rochdale was arrested with his aunt, cousins and four children while attempting to get into Syria. After the arrest, anti-terror police raided the home of his father, Shakil Ahmed, a respected Labour councillor for the town. Munshi's family comes from Dewsbury in West Yorkshire, where his grandfather Yakub Munshi ran the town's sharia court. The schoolboy, who was studying for his GCSEs at Westborough High School in Kirklees, West Yorkshire, was traced through his online conversations with 'cyber terrorist' Aabid Hussain Khan. In one MSN chat, they argued how best to sneak a metal sword through airport security. Munshi had painstakingly scoured the internet for details on how to make napalm and grenades. He claimed he had only done the research out of curiosity but handwritten notes hidden under his bed revealed his burning desire to travel abroad to become a martyr. Munshi also had a library of videos, documents and audio clips showing acts of jihad, mujaheddin fighters and Al Qaeda preachings. Khan, who acted as an administrator on an extremist website called Activion Publications, downloaded information on the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Charles and Camilla, Prince Edward, the Countess of Wessex, The Duke of York and the Princess Royal. Munshi was convicted of making a record of information likely to be useful in terrorism. Khan was found guilty of possessing articles for a purpose connected with terrorism but cleared of a similar charge. A third man, Sultan Muhammad from Manningham, West Yorkshire - Khan's cousin - was convicted of three similar charges and one of making a record of information likely to be useful in terrorism.","Families of Hassan Munshi and Talha Asmal, both 17, released statement .

"Jenson Button believes McLaren now have their rivals in their sights ahead of this weekend's Chinese Grand Prix. After starting the new Formula One season in Australia with a severe lack of pace, McLaren and new power-unit supplier Honda made significant progress a fortnight later in Malaysia. Although both Button and team-mate Fernando Alonso retired during the race at the Sepang International Circuit, the duo at least discovered the car was competitive alongside other midfield runners. Jenson Button looks on in the garage during final practice for last month's Malaysian Grand Prix . That came as a pleasant surprise to Button, who is now hoping further steps have been taken going into this weekend's race in Shanghai. 'Obviously we want to finish a race, but seeing improvement in pace was much more important,' said Button. 'Yes, we both had failures, but I'd rather that with us pushing and trying to get more power out of the car than trotting around at the back and simply getting to the end. 'To be able to race other cars, and see the Red Bulls until a long way into the race, was good. 'We would probably have been 20 seconds behind them. I know they're not quick, but that is a good step forward for us. Button returns to the McLaren garage after retiring during the race at the Sepang circuit . 'Right now we're comparing ourselves with the Force Indias, Saubers and Lotuses. 'We were quicker than Force India; the Sauber was on the same sort of pace, and the Lotus wasn't that much quicker. 'Fighting with the pack is important for me. It's what I enjoy and hopefully race by race we'll start picking them off.' Despite the positives, Button acknowledges the entire team, including Honda, 'still has a long way to go'. British driver Button in action before he retired from the Malaysian Grand Prix . Button added: 'We need and want more downforce to fight with the guys around us, and we still have a lot to do with the power unit, but our basic car is good. 'If you look at our high-speed pace, compared to the Force India and Sauber, then we are much stronger. 'So we're moving in the right direction, and I'm already surprised we are racing cars. It's great to see.' Part of the reasoning behind McLaren's improvement in Malaysia, in comparison to Australia, was the high temperatures which suited the car. McLaren driver Fernando Alonso (left) drives ahead of team-mate Button in Kuala Lumpur . Button appreciates the cooler air in Shanghai could have an effect. The 35-year-old said: 'There is a feeling the expected cooler weather will make it harder to generate tyre temperature. 'That could mean any progress we make doesn't necessarily translate to a lap-time benefit. 'But there is definitely progress being made, and it's great to be able to play a role in helping move the whole team forwards. 'It'll be fascinating to see how much change we can effect over the forthcoming races.'","Jenson Button and Fernando Alonso both retired in Malaysia last month .

"'Loneliness maps' are being used to tackle the problem of elderly people being left alone by working out which areas' residents are most at risk. Health experts have warned that being socially isolated can be as harmful as smoking 15 cigarettes a day, leading to an increased risk of problems such as dementia and high blood pressure. Now campaigners say that local councils should draw up maps of the places where pensioners and others are most likely to suffer from social isolation. Map: This 'loneliness map' was drawn up by Essex County Council showing the areas where residents are most vulnerable to becoming socially isolated . Two county councils, Essex and Gloucestershire, have already implemented the maps, which allow them to target 'danger zones' of loneliness. A new report from the University of Kent and the Campaign to End Loneliness recommends the maps as a way of treating the problem across the country. In Gloucestershire, council bosses compiled the maps by studying statistics on a range of public health factors which are often linked to lonely people. They looked for areas with large numbers of over-65s, people living alone, people suffering from mental illness, households with no car and people on a low income. Danger: Being lonely can lead to health problems including dementia (picture posed by model) The council also surveyed residents to identify those who rarely speak to their neighbours, are unsatisfied with their social life and say they don't have someone to talk to. They then combined all those factors to map the districts where people are most likely to be suffering from loneliness, with the most vulnerable areas marked in red. A spokesman for the council said: 'Targeting local people who need our help the most is a priority for us in Gloucestershire and we are always looking at new ways to reach them. 'The map we've adapted from a model by Essex County Council means that we can work out how many people could be lonely and where those people need us most.' The Campaign to End Loneliness has now called on other councils to copy the maps and draw up their own versions for their local area. The campaign's director Laura Alcock-Ferguson said: 'Finding people who are experiencing loneliness can be challenging, as they are often also some of the most hidden people in our communities. 'However, it is encouraging that, across the country, there are excellent examples of councils that are employing different strategies to identify residents most at risk of loneliness. 'If local councils and services do not act now to find the people experiencing severe loneliness, we are likely to see the consequences in our hospitals and social care services.' The report identifies a number of other risk factors that might make people more likely to suffer from chronic loneliness. People from ethnic minorities, those recently bereaved or forced to care for their loved ones and childless pensioners are particularly susceptible.","Local councils are urged to draw up maps of the residents who are at risk .

"Bafetimbi Gomis scored twice in Swansea's 3-1 win over Hull on Saturday and tops this week's EA Sports' Performance Index after another thrilling installment of Premier League action. During a weekend of stunning goals, Gomis got in on the act with an impressive overhead kick before doubling his goal tally in the last minute of Swansea's victory. The Frenchman - who made a slow start to his career in south Wales after playing second fiddle to the recently-departed Wilfried Bony - has scored four goals in his last six Premier League games and earned a Game Index score of 52.9 this weekend.

"Most people would sensibly keep their distance from a pool full of alligators - but this astonishing footage shows one adrenaline junkie precariously navigating a slackline over more than 50 of the hungry reptiles. Jason McDonald, 34, from Aurora, Colorado, walked the thin rope line over a pool containing more the alligators - some which measure up to ten feet in length - at the Colorado Gator Farm. Crematory manager Mr McDonald, who volunteers at the farm, has been involved with alligators for over ten years and has taken handling classes, said he thought this would be an interesting new way of interacting with the fearsome creatures. Scroll down for video . Jason McDonald walked the thin slackline rope over a pool containing more than 50 hungry alligators . 'I got the idea after watching my friend Josh Beaudoin, who likes to walk slacklines several hundred feet up in the air,' he said. 'I knew I wasn't at that level yet but that I could put my own spin on it and walk over gators. 'The gators are surprisingly ok with the slackline. 'The first time we set it up they approached but didn't get very close. This time it didn't seem to bother them at all.' Mr McDonald said that while his parents have reservations about his daring antics, he has plans to take his hobby further. Mr McDonald mounts the slackrope above the alligators pond where more than 50 of the reptiles live . Two of the pond's inhabitants appeared to be particularly intrigued by the development overhead . Mr McDonald took this shot which shows the disconcertingly narrow slackrope - and watching alligator . Mr McDonald said he thought this would be an interesting new way of interacting with the fearsome creatures . 'My mother wants me to be careful and remember I'm a father but she also knows I'm good at working with the gators - and although it can be dangerous I do it as safely as possible,' he said. 'Going forward we want to walk over Elvis or Morris, our two biggest gators on the farm. 'I also think it would be cool to walk over the top of our albino gators since that would be hard to recreate since we have four, and not many people even have one albino.' Mr McDonald, who has been volunteering at the farm for 10 years, had never been bitten before last month - when an 8ft alligator clamped down on his hand for more than 10 minutes. Mr McDonald, who treats and cares for the rescued animals,  performs tricks for visitors to the farm in his spare time. He became involved with Colorado Gators when he signed up for a wrestling class. Colorado Gators started out as a fish farm but in 1987 its owners decided to buy 100 baby gators as a means of disposing of guts and carcasses.

"(CNN)Former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez will need to keep his lawyers even after being convicted of murder and other charges in the death of Odin Lloyd. The 25-year-old potentially faces three more trials -- one criminal and two civil actions. Next up is another murder trial in which he is accused of killing two men and wounding another person near a Boston nightclub in July 2012. Prosecutors have said Hernandez fatally shot Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado when he fired into their 2003 BMW.  Another passenger was wounded and two others were uninjured. Hernandez pleaded not guilty at his arraignment. The trial was originally slated for May 28, but Jake Wark, spokesman for the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office, said Wednesday the trial had been postponed and no new date had been set. ""We expect to select a new court date in the coming days and then set the amended trial track. The Suffolk indictments allege two counts of first-degree murder for the July 16, 2012, shooting deaths of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado in Boston's South End; three counts of armed assault with intent to murder and one count of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon for shots fired at three surviving victims; and one count of unlawful possession of a firearm,"" he said. The families of de Abreu and Furtado filed civil suits against Hernandez, and a judge froze his $5 million in assets, pending the outcome of the double-murder trial. The freeze includes the disputed $3.3 million signing bonus payment Hernandez claims he is owed by the New England Patriots. Hernandez is also being sued by a man who claims Hernandez shot him while they were in a limousine in Miami in February 2013. Alexander Bradley claims the then-New England Patriot tight end wounded him after the two got into a fight at a Miami strip club. In a lawsuit filed four months later, Bradley said Hernandez fired at him during a limo ride after leaving the club and that Hernandez intentionally ""possessed a gun which he was not legally licensed to have."" Hernandez's lawyers have argued he couldn't defend himself properly while on trial in Massachusetts. There was no criminal charge in the case. And then there is the grievance over unpaid bonus money filed by the NFL players union on behalf of Hernandez, who signed a contract in 2012 that potentially was worth more than $40 million. If the grievance is heard by the league, Hernandez will be represented by the the National Football League Players' Association. Who was Odin Lloyd? CNN's Lawrence Crook contributed to this report.","Aaron Hernandez has been found guilty in Odin Lloyd's death, but his troubles are not over .

"The return of Game of Thrones has sparked a surge in internet piracy with fans making more than 100,000 illegal downloads per day. More than seven million episodes from seasons one to four were illegally downloaded between February and April this year as fans of the hit HBO show caught up or re-capped before its eagerly-return on Sky Atlantic on Sunday night.

"Michael Phelps is aiming to compete in a fifth Olympics next year in Rio, although the 18-time Olympic champion won't swim in the world championships this summer. Phelps confirmed his intention to make one last run at the Olympics on Wednesday. 'You guys heard it here first,' he told reporters at Skyline Aquatic Center, where he will be competing in his first meet since serving a six-month suspension by USA Swimming after a second drunken driving arrest last fall. 'I am looking forward to next year. I don't think it's too hard to really realize why I came back.' 18-time Olympic champion Michael Phelps is aiming to compete in a fifth Olympics next year in Rio . But Phelps said he won't be swimming at the world meet in Russia in August as part of the punishment set forth by the sport's U.S. governing body. He had already qualified in three events before being banned from the last major international meet before the Rio de Janeiro Olympics. 'I really enjoy being on those trips,' he said. 'That's why it is painful to think that I won't have the chance to compete at worlds.' There had been informal discussions about Phelps being reinstated to the US team for worlds, but it would have meant removing swimmers that were named to the team in his absence. 'By no means do I want this to be a distraction from the team,' he said. 'No way would I ever want to displace a member of that team.' Phelps in action during a practice session Mesa, Arizona on Wednesday . Phelps is back in Arizona, where he attended 45 days of inpatient alcohol rehabilitation after being arrested on DUI charges in his hometown of Baltimore last September. He offered no specifics about his treatment, which he continued in Maryland. He also enrolled in Alcoholics Anonymous. 'The last couple of months have probably been the hardest I've ever had to go through in my entire life,' he said. 'I take full responsibility for all of my actions. I've hurt a lot of people and it's been terrible.' The 29-year-old swimmer was sentenced to 18 months of probation. He said he's done more growing up in recent months than he has in his entire life. 'I have been able to come out on a better end, have a clear head,' he said. 'I don't think I've ever been like this once in my life.' Phelps' longtime coach, Bob Bowman, acknowledged his star swimmer's second arrest for drunken driving made it 'pretty hard to convince me that anything was going to lead us back to something that we'd be proud of.' Phelps called Bowman a few times from rehab, which the coach described as 'really weird' because he typically never heard from Phelps away from the pool. Bowman visited Phelps during treatment, still skeptical that the swimmer was there for any reason other than he had to be. But Bowman left thinking differently. Phelps is back in Arizona, where he attended 45 days of inpatient alcohol rehabilitation . 'I just had no doubt that he had changed in a way that was really meaningful,' Bowman said. 'He was completely different and it's been that way every day since he's been back.' Phelps pleaded guilty after his first drunken driving arrest in 2004. Five years later, a photo was published of him using a marijuana pipe at a party, which drew a three-month suspension and caused some sponsors to drop him. Phelps knows not everyone will believe he's contrite and has changed. 'If somebody doesn't believe the words that are coming out of my mouth that's their choice,' he said. 'I, of course, would like to show everybody in the world that I am in a different place and I am much better than I ever have been. I understand that's going to take a lot of time. This week will be the first week that I can start that.' Phelps will be competing in Mesa for the first time since the Pan Pacific Championships last August. The Arizona meet was where Phelps made his comeback a year ago after an extended retirement following the 2012 Olympics. Phelps adjusts North Baltimore Aquatic Center team-mate Allison Schmidt's cap during practice . He isn't sure what to expect, having only recently returned to the kind of hard training he did before the 2008 Beijing Games, where he won a record eight gold medals. Phelps is falling back on the mentality he used for much of his career. 'I would just get up and swim as hard as I could and leave it in the water,' he said. 'That's what I'm going to do here. I know I'm more prepared now than I was at this time last year.' His first event is the 100-meter butterfly on Thursday, when he'll compete against longtime rival Ryan Lochte. Phelps is surrounding himself with familiar faces this week, including his fiancee Nicole Johnson and family members. 'I'm a lot happier and in a lot better state and in a lot better physical shape than I really have been in a long time,' he said.","Michael Phelps is hoping to compete a the 2016 Olympics in Rio .

"Quarter of a century after his last number one, Paul Simon is back at the top of the charts. The 73-year-old - who rose to fame as part of Simon & Garfunkel - has forged ahead of more youthful musicians to reach number one in the UK album chart with The Ultimate Collection. His album outsold those by the likes of Ed Sheeran, James Bay and Sam Smith. Number one: Paul Simon topped the UK albums chart for the first time in 25 years. His latest release, The Ultimate Collection, beat albums from more youthful musicians such as Ed Sheeran and Sam Smith . Simon's recent tour with Sting (left) is believed to have been the catalyst in helping to propel him to the top of the charts. It is the first time he has reached the top of the album chart since The Rhythm of the Saints in 1990 . The greatest hits record includes 19 tracks from Simon’s 50-year career, including Mrs Robinson and The Only Living Boy in New York, from his days recording and performing as Simon & Garfunkel with Art Garfunkel, prior to their break up in the 1970s, and some of his solo hits such as 50 Ways to Leave Your Lover. It marks a return to popularity for the Grammy Award-winning singer, 73, as the first time he has reached the top of the album chart since The Rhythm of the Saints in 1990. Simon is currently on his On Stage Together world tour with Sting. It is thought the success of the pair’s live shows, which have been met with rave reviews, is what propelled the album to number one.

"An Indiana university was in lockdown late on Friday night after a 'likely prank call' about an armed person near the main administration building, school officials said. Police said they received a phone call from someone saying that they had stabbed their roommate at the university, was armed with a shotgun and threatening to blow up the administration building, according to WTHR. Manchester University had issued a statement advising students at its North Manchester campus, some 36 miles  west of Fort Wayne, to shelter in place. Indiana State Police and a bomb squad responded to the incident, though left after deciding that it should be investigated as a likely prank call. Scroll down for video .

"Out there in the desert, the mirage continues to shimmer for Amir Khan. The identity of the challenge becomes blurred in the haze. First it looks like Floyd Mayweather. Now he glimpses Manny Pacquiao. And in which oasis in the sand might he finally touch gloves with one of the two best boxers on earth? The initial lure has been Mayweather in Las Vegas, Nevada. Now the siren call is Pacquiao in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. For two years Khan has been so close to fighting Mayweather that he could smell the resin and hear the roar of the crowd. Yet each time he reaches out, the tantalising illusion fades and slips away like so many fantasies along the Vegas Strip. Now the image of Pacquiao dances before him and there is reason to believe that a tale which might have been told by Scheherazade could become reality one starlit Arabian night. After waiting and waiting for Floyd Mayweather, Amir Khan could be set to face Manny Pacquiao . A fight with Pacquiao, preparing to face Floyd Mayweather on May 2, is on the cards for Abu Dhabi . The handsome young prince of British boxing will pay a flying visit to Vegas on May 2, there to watch the PacMan and the Money Man dispute the richest fight of all time. Win or lose, Pacquiao could await Khan come winter. Sportsmail's Jeff Powell with Amir Khan . Bob Arum, the PacMan’s vintage promoter, has to hand a treasure trove of an offer for a fight in Abu Dhabi this November or December. Khan, the stand-by for Pacquiao had Mayweather refused the Fight of the Century, is Arum’s first choice for that extravaganza in the Middle East. Once Pacquiao’s sparring partner, now Khan says: ‘I want this fight. I would love to box Manny. We’ve been looking at an event in Dubai and Abu Dhabi is only a short drive away. It’s a dream of mine to fight in that part of the world.’ As a hero of the Muslim world, Khan would be a huge attraction there. He now has initials which are the Pakistan equivalent of a CBE behind his name. His father and mother have just returned from Islamabad where, on their son’s behalf, they received from President Mamnoon Hussain the PAPID - the President’ s Award for Pride In Performance. Arum is aware of that box office potential but also recognises the boxing qualities of the ‘nice young man’ from Bolton: ‘Amir has great speed. Maybe the only guy as fast as Manny. And his recent performances have been impressive. This would be an outstanding fight.’ Assuming that Khan wins his interim bout with Chris Algieri in New York next month, all that would appear to stand between him and his long-awaited mega-fight is the outside chance of a re-match between Pacquiao and Mayweather. Promoter Bob Arum (left), with Pacquiao and Roach after the 2009 win over Miguel Cotto, rates Khan highly . Floyd Jnr seems to have no great appetite for a second edition of May 2nd, even though a return bout might bank the man who nicknames himself Money another couple of hundred million dollars. Either way, Mayweather will conclude his enriching six-fight contract with the Showtime cable network in America in September. That timing rules out Khan as his opponent - yet again after two broken promises - because his strict observance of Ramadan would not end in time for him to prepare fully. But if it’s not a re-match and Mayweather finds another opponent, Pacquiao-Khan is a natural for both of them. Pacquiao prefers an early winter date for his second fight of a year and Khan says: ‘Late November or December is perfect for me.’ Furthermore, it is highly unlikely that if Mayweather beats Pacquiao he will want to risk his cherished unbeaten record for a second time against the most dangerous of all his opponents. Floyd Mayweather will end his six-fight deal with Showtime in September, which won't work for Khan . Pacquiao works out with trainer Freddie Roach at their base at Wild Card Boxing in Los Angeles . And Khan suspects that will be the upshot in Vegas: ‘I actually think that once Mayweather gets through Manny’s assault in the first few rounds it will become an easy win for him. ‘Manny has speed and power but Floyd has the defensive skill to avoid him and the brain and accuracy to keep picking him off as he comes in. ‘The longer it goes the harder it will get for Manny and if he is to win he will have to keep up the pace through every minute of every round.’ Khan has affection as well as respect for his old spar-mate, so it puts him in a curious position to realise that defeat for his pal would benefit himself. Khan believes Pacquiao will struggle more with Mayweather the longer their mega-fight goes on . So he says: ‘I’ll just watch it with a professional eye. And there is a chance that if Floyd’s legs really are slowing down that Manny will catch up with him - and he can punch.’ By way of further irony, Khan has been working lately to add to his high-speed aggression exactly the kind of patience he would need if he ever did fight Mayweather. Hidden away in a unit in a business park in Oakland, across the Bay from San Francisco, is the gym in which trainer Virgil Hunter hones the talents of Khan and his long-time protege Andre Ward, who will shortly make his own comeback from a long lay-off. Khan has to first overcome Chris Algieri (left), who was decked six time by Pacquiao, on May 29 in New York . But as his higher education continues under Hunter, he is buckling down. Partly in the knowledge, at 28, that these are his prime years and they must not be squandered. He says: ‘I’ve wasted the best part of a couple of years waiting for Floyd because I would love to be the man who beat the man considered the best pound-for-pound in the world. Now I have to make the most of every day because soon it may be too late. ‘Floyd and Manny are getting closer to retirement and if I don’t fight one of them soon it may never happen.’ That is one of the reasons why Khan puts on hold a Battle of Britain with Kell Brook, preferring to focus on selling himself in America and thereby stay at the front of the queue for a shot at Pacquiao or Mayweather. Kell Brook (left) is fighting Frankie Gavin (right) in the 02 Arena and Khan says he has to wait to face him . Does his May 29 fight with Algieri - recently floored six times by Pacquiao in Macao - help that crusade? ‘Algieri’s a better fighter than Frankie Gavin (Brook’s world title challenger next month). He’s world lightweight champion and he’s fought at a far higher level than Frankie. Kell can wait.’ Khan says: ‘Being at ringside (on May 2) will be a bit frustrating but I accept that this is the fight the whole world has been waiting to see. So no. I won’t be feeling any resentment.’ It is not much more than a half-hour’s flight from Oakland to Vegas. Amir Khan is hoping that the next time he takes to the air it will be on a magic carpet — to Arabia.","Amir Khan could be set to face Manny Pacquiao in Abu Dhabi, UAE .

"Stephanie Scott's devastated father has opened up about the grief her family is feeling as they struggle to come to terms with their daughter's brutal murder, which took place just days before her much-anticipated wedding. The adored school teacher from Leeton went missing on Easter Sunday and her body was found in nearby bushland the following Friday. Ms Scott's grieving father Robert explained that it is especially painful that Stephanie's life has been taken away when she had so much to look forward to.

'You walk around the house and there's so many little things she planned for the wedding,' said Mr Scott (left, pictured with Stephanie's mother and one of her sisters) The happy couple, Aaron Leeson-Woolley and Stephanie Scott (both pictured right), had sent out invites for their wedding day which was supposed to be held on Saturday . The high school where she worked turned into a memorial site after it emerged Ms Scott had been murdered . The ceremony was due to go ahead on Saturday April 11 - however cruelly the day before her remains were discovered by police. Ms Scott and Mr Leeson-Woolley had been taking dancing lessons together to prepare for their first dance as an excited married couple, according to Robert. But the moment when Mr Leeson-Woolley should have been holding his new bride during their planned first dance to a Keith Urban song, he was inconsolable at his fiancée's memorial. Ms Scott's father says he has been contemplating the afterlife since Ms Scott's shocking death, but is confident that his beautiful, sweet daughter is in 'the best possible place' after living a life full of love and happiness. 'When you die I don't know what happens really, but you leave this body and our spirit is what goes on,' Mr Scott told The Daily Telegraph.

Mr Scott paid tribute to his daughter, remember her joyful childhood from her birth in Sydney, early childhood in Sydney's St Clair and time on the land from the age of nine, living in Canowindra. She loved her family, drama, soccer and school - eager for every opportunity to learn. It comes after local Leeton parents expressed anger over the loss of their children's 'favourite teacher' as the town continues to mourn the death of Stephanie Scott. Stephanie Scott was a 'favourite teacher' to many students at Leeton High School . A week before students are due to return to class after school holidays, mothers have have taken to a community Facebook page to talk about how the 26-year-old's murder has affected their kids. 'Well said, my daughter has lost her favourite teacher, and she will never be the same,' wrote Glenda Goolagong. Meanwhile Jodie Salerno posted: 'Stephanie was my son and 2 daughters favourite teacher at leeton high this ... has put so much pain and sadness on our comunity [sic].' Ms Salerno told The Australian her three children 'don't want to return' to school because they are so upset over Ms Scott's death. This comes as police are due to begin an autopsy on Stephanie Scott's body to determine how she was killed. Ms Scott's remains have been transported to Glebe Morgue in Sydney, and a NSW Department of Justice spokeswoman confirmed State Coroner Michael Barnes has ordered that an autopsy be carried out this week. Detectives who are leading the investigation into the death of Stephanie Scott will reportedly make inquiries with authorities in the Netherlands in an attempt to run a background check on the accused killer. School cleaner Vincent Stanford, who moved to Leeton  from Holland over a year ago with his mother and brother, was charged with Ms Scott's murder on Thursday. A week before students are due to return to class after school holidays, mothers have have taken to a community Facebook page to talk about how the 26-year-old's murder has affected their children .

NSW Police will get in contact with their counterparts in the Netherlands to determine if the accused 24-year-old murderer had any relevant history there, AAP reports. Stanford has reportedly been uncooperative with investigators. Daily Mail Australia has contacted NSW police for comment. It has also emerged that one of the last actions of Ms Scott was to send an email to the bus company hired for her wedding, confirming transportation for guests. The revelation follows after police discovered the charred remains of a woman's body around 5pm on Friday after they were directed to Cocoparra National Park north of Griffith, NSW by  Stanford's family. It's further alleged a gasoline can had been found nearby. It is understood Stanford was familiar to the area and went on regular camping trips to the national park  on many occasions with his family.

"A down-on-their-luck couple from Ohio struggling with chronic conditions that left them unable to make a living were found dead from self-inflicted carbon monoxide poisoning this week, less than two months after their desperate pleas for help went ignored. Randy and Jodi Speidel, from Bellefontaine, created online fundraisers on GiveFroward.com and GoFundMe.com in late February begging Good Samaritans for financial help. Mrs Speidel wrote that they had been living without gas all winter, had no running water and were close to having their electricity and Internet service shut off. Hopeless: Randy and Jodi Speidel, from Bellefontaine, Ohio, took their own lives this week, more than two months after they created online fundraisers begging for financial help . Heartbreaking: The middle-aged couple died from self-inflicted carbon monoxide poisoning caused by two charcoal grills they had dragged into their bedroom . Last-ditch effort: Mrs Speidel wrote on GiveForward.com in late February that they had been living without gas all winter, had no running water and cut down their food intake to one meal a day . After having paid $500 to their landlord to prevent their immediate eviction, Mrs Speidel stated that they were left with only $33 to their name. To stretch their meager funds a little farther, the impoverished, ailing couple were forced to limit their food intake to a single meal a day and did not have enough scraps to feed their two cats. ‘I have turned in every direction possible and don’t know what else to do,’ she wrote. ‘If you can help, we will be forever grateful and will even pay you back once we get back on our feet.’ The Speidles were hoping to raise $1,000, but the online campaign failed to draw any donations whatsoever. On Tuesday, the couple's landlord, Doug Elleman, arrived at their rental at 225 West High Avenue to discover a pink handwritten note warning passersby of carbon monoxide inside, reported Bellefontaine Examiner. Firefighters who were called to the scene entered the residence and discovered a pair of charcoal grills filled with smoldering coals. Jodi Speidel, 46, and her 45-year-old husband, Randy, were pronounced dead at the scene. Orpahns: The couple leave behind two daughters, Randa (pictured right as a baby with her father) and 20-year-old Kira Speidel . Columbus Dispatch reported that a note found nearby confirmed that the husband and wife had made a suicide pact. The couple had removed their beloved pet cats from the house to spare their lives. They were later found wandering outside. The couple leave behind two daughters, Randa and Kira Speidel. In a post left last month on her parents' GoFundMe.com page, which has since been removed, 20-year-old Kira called the couple 'the hardest-working people I know.' She went on to say that now that they can no longer work because of their physical ailments, 'they have nowhere to run.' Police Chief Brandon Standley said the town has resources available for people in need like the Speidels, adding that it's tragic that they thought they were all out of options. In one of her online pleas, Jodi Speidel mentioned she had applied for assistance and was told to wait. Her GiveForward.com campaign description indicates that despite her infirmities, Speidel was able to land a new job but needed some help to tie them over until her pay checks started coming in.","Jodi Speidel, 46, and her 45-year-old husband, Randy, were found dead in their Bellefontaine, Ohio, home Tuesday .

"Wladimir Klitschko has recalled his dramatic rise to the top on the eve of his world title defence against undefeated Bryant Jennings. The Ukrainian superstar will make his return to US soil for the first time in seven years when he takes on the slick Philadelphian at the iconic Madison Square Garden in New York. The 39-year-old Klitschko, though, has been reminiscing about how it all started for him when he won Olympic gold in Atlanta in 1996, instantly catapulting him into a hero in his home country over night. Reigning heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko (right) faces up to Bryant Jennings on Friday . 'I remember before I went to the Olympics and former Olympic champion in track running, [Valeriy] Borzov, he was Minister of Sports in the Ukraine said, 'Guys, you're going to the Olympics and one of you is going to win gold. That's going to change your life.' 'He was really right about it. I remember by winning the gold at the Olympics, when I came back home it completely changed my life. 'Sport definitely has power to change one's life and the world, as Nelson Mandela said. When I became champion of the world in the heavyweight division, that was 15 years ago, in 2000, and it was an amazing moment. Klitschko poses on the scale for the official weigh-in at Madison Square Garden in New York on Friday . 'I do remember clearly how it was and it was additional motivation to keep doing what I was doing. I was only 24-years-old. I mean, very, very young, but I took it seriously and I was working up to it and I believed that my work was appreciated with my success in the ring and that I became champion.' WBA, WBO, IBF and IBO champion Klitschko hasn't shown any signs of decline in recent times despite being just a year short of his 40th birthday. Still dominant and sitting high at the top of boxing's glamour division Klitschko believes age has no bearing on how long he can go on for. Klitschko will make his return to US soil for the first time in seven years at Madison Square Garden . 'I definitely think that age is just a number. Actually, it's a big advantage instead of disadvantage because with the age you're getting better. With the right lifestyle there's nothing that can go wrong,' he added. 'I'm really happy about the preparation [for this training camp] and I'm happy that I'm an athlete and I can get in the peak of my performance thanks to my experience. I'm looking forward to Saturday night. 'My sparring partners were 23, 25, 27, 29-years-old. It's amazing and interesting that considering my age, I used to be the youngest in the gym all the time, and now it seems my sparring partners are much younger than me. I see myself in them and we work very well. Former heaxyweight boxing champions Evander Holyfield (left) and Lennox Lewis were in attendance . Jennings, with a record of 19-0 with 10 knockouts, has been working on ways to nullify the well renowned Klitschko jab which he has utilised so effectively against past opponents. 'He has a great jab but I have an exceptional jab compared to his as well. He is one of the best athletes I've seen for that,' he said. 'There are definitely plenty of ways to actually get inside of a jab. Like lateral movement, head movement and relentless effort will definitely penetrate and make a change. 'I have 100 per cent confidence in everything that I do. I had a great training camp. The way that we actually prepare to manoeuvre around the jab, I feel is effective and I have 100 per cent faith in what we practiced. All I'm going to have to be is patient and be smart.'

The Bavarians, chasing three titles this season, are without Arjen Robben, Franck Ribery, Bastian Schweinsteiger and David Alaba among others for the quarter-final, first leg in Portugal. 'For the (recent) games against Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen we had two matches where we played with a decimated squad and with few options,' Muller said. Bayern Munich striker Thomas Muller believes his team are stronger for their recent injury troubles . Muller celebrates his goal in Bayern's 3-0 Bundesliga win over Eintracht Frankfurt at the weekend . Bayern keeper Manuel Neuer whispers in Muller's ear during their press conference before the Porto game . Bayern beat Dortmund in the Bundesliga before edging past Leverkusen in the German Cup last eight on penalties and looked unaffected by the absences. They also beat Eintracht Frankfurt 3-0 on Saturday. 'In those games we came closer together as a group, as a unit, and that will obviously help us against Porto,' said Muller. 'Now it is not about the injuries but about building a strong unit on the pitch with the players who are there. We are confident and hopefully we can score a few goals.' Five-times champions Bayern will rely heavily on the scoring prowess of Muller and Robert Lewandowski in the absence of Robben and Ribery as they look to become the first team to beat Porto in the Champions League this season. Bayern coach Pep Guardiola is eyeing up a Treble of Bundesliga, DFB-Pokal and Champions League . Bayern celebrate with their supporters at the end of Saturday's 3-0 win over Eintracht Frankfurt .

Twice winners Porto won four matches and drew twice in the group stage before crushing Basel 5-1 on aggregate in the round of 16. 'I am surprised with their level and we will need two good games to reach the semi-finals,' said Bayern coach Pep Guardiola. 'They play an open game ... they have physical midfielders but with great quality. That is also their biggest asset. Their individual quality.' Guardiola added there was no point talking about the Bayern injuries, saying he would simply try his best with the players at his disposal. 'The last two weeks we talked about this a lot but we have this situation and we are here with these 14 players and we will try our best. That's what it is and I won't complain,' he explained.","Bayern are in Portugal to face Porto in Champions League quarters .

"Huddersfield coach Paul Anderson is hoping to kick-start his side's misfiring attack to match the efficiency of their defence as they look to start climbing back up the Super League ladder. The Giants have plummeted from third to ninth after losing all three games over the Easter holiday period but they go into Sunday's home game against Catalans Dragons with the best defensive record in the league. 'There's no hiding away from the fact we are a very good defensive team, we've just got to get our juices flowing offensively more than anything and we've put some things in place to try and make that happen,' said Anderson. Paul Anderson is hoping to kick-start his Hudderfield side's misfiring attack to climb up Super League . The Giants have plummeted from third to ninth after losing all three games over the Easter holiday period . 'We know what we're capable of and we know we can quite easily go on a decent run. We had a poor start and a poor week because the games have come thick and fast. 'We've had some issues with our offence all year and I've got to take responsibility for that, because that's my role at the club, it's my job to try and fix it. 'If we were getting beaten by 30 or 40 points we'd have some serious issues. We just need to make sure we find our groove with the ball as well as we have without it. 'If you look at the last three games we've lost, if we'd have got one more score in every game we'd probably have come out winners - those are the fine margins that we're dealing with at the minute.' A first win in four would enable Huddersfield to leapfrog their French visitors, who have won just one of five away games so far this year. Widnes are the only team yet to take a point from their travels but they will be aiming to capitalise on their impressive record at the Select Security Stadium against Castleford in Sunday's other league game. Anderson says there is no hiding when facing Catalans Dragons, who have the league's best defensive record . The Yorkshiremen can climb to a season-high fourth if they make it three wins in a row and Vikings coach Denis Betts is expecting a stern test from Daryl Powell's improving side. 'Castleford have a solid squad who all know their jobs,' Betts said. 'They work really hard for each other in defence and that allows them freedom to express themselves in attack. 'We've had some really tough games against them - very competitive games. I expect a tough physical encounter on Sunday.'","Huddersfield have plummeted to ninth in Super League after a horrible Easter .

"A young English cricket fan who wrote a letter to Richie Benaud asking for tips on spin bowling almost 20 years ago has shared the Australian cricket great's response in the wake of his death. Jonathan Stevenson was just 16 years old when he asked for Benaud's advice on left-handed leg spin and he shared the lengthy response on Twitter on Friday as a tribute to the 'great man'. 'Wrote to Richie Benaud when I was 16 about bowling leggies. His detailed reply says everything about the great man,' Mr Stevenson, who  is now a director at LiveWire Sport, tweeted. Scroll down for video . A letter from Richie Benaud to an English fan, Jonathon Stevenson, almost 20 years ago emerged on Friday in the wake of the cricket legend's death . Accompanying the letter from Benaud, dated September 27, 1996, was a full sheet of notes about spin bowling for left-hand bowlers. 'Your letter was timely because it was the first from a left-hander and it reminded me that there is a difference in coaching and not just in the fact that one youngster might bowl with the right hand and another with the left,' Benaud wrote. 'The ball, although coming out of the hand in the same manner and going in the same direction towards the batsmen, in fact spins differently for the two types of bowlers.' Jonathan Stevenson, who now works at LiveWire Sport, was just 16 years old when he asked for Benaud's advice on left-handed leg spin and he shared the lengthy response on Twitter  as a tribute to the 'great man' Accompanying the letter from Benaud, dated September 27, 1996, was a full sheet of notes about spin bowling for left-hand bowlers . Benaud enjoyed a remarkable Test career as a wily leg-spin bowler and middle-order batsman which ended with his retirement in 1964. He was the first player to score 2,000 Test runs and take 200 Test wickets. 'I hope you enjoy your cricket and your bowling,' Benaud said. 'Yes, the left-arm over-the-wrist bowler who spins the ball into the right-hander from outside the off-stump is said to have bowled a Chinaman. The same bowler who spins one away from the right-hander has bowled a wrong'un.' After retiring, Benaud became a commentary icon initially with the BBC in England and later in his native Australia . The typed letter, dated September 27, 1996, was personally signed by Benaud . It included tips on different deliveries  and gave pointers as to how they should be delivered . In his letter to a young Mr Stevenson, he listed a full page of various different deliveries the teenager should try and gave pointers as to how they should be delivered. 'Don't even think about learning the 'flipper' before you have mastered the leg-break, topspinner and wrong'un,' he finished with. The typed letter was  signed by Benaud.

'She works in VR and she works at the front desk.' She reached out to friends on social media who knew Simmons and the next day she got a phone call from her birth mother. 'She called me and I said, ""Is this Ms. Francine?"" She said, yes. I said, ""I think I'm your daughter"",' Mitchell-Clark said about the first time the women spoke.

"Residents of a tiny Missouri city say they have no idea why five of their six police officers and several other top officials resigned after their first black mayor was elected. Tyrus Byrd, 40, was sworn into office in Parma last week, but her election victory was overshadowed by the departure of the majority of the police force, the city attorney, clerk and water treatment supervisor. The officials all cited 'safety concerns' in their resignation letters, the outgoing mayor says. There are 713 people living in the community and, according to the US Census Bureau, 57percent are white and 41percent are black. Unwelcome change: Tyrus Byrd, who was sworn in as mayor last week, must find replacements for five of the city's six police officers, the city attorney, the city clerk and the water treatment supervisor. Mrs Byrd, who was sworn in last Wednesday, told Daily Mail Online she still doesn't know why the employees quit - though the outgoing mayor says they cited 'safety concerns' in their resignations . Mrs Byrd, who was sworn in on Wednesday, told the Daily Mail Online on Sunday that she is still not sure why the city employees quit. Her father, former city board member Simon Wofford, insists his daughter has a good relationship with the police department. KFVS-TV broke the story last week. Citizens rallied to Mrs Bryd's side, saying that the town didn't even need as many officers as it had. 'I think it was pretty dirty the way they all quit without giving her a chance, but I don't think they hurt the town with quitting because who needs six police for 740 people?' resident Martha Miller told KFVS. The run-down city, which is 175 miles south of St. Louis in southeastern Missouri, has suffered a spate of break-ins recently. Despite the surge in crime and the comparatively large police force, residents told the TV station that they almost never saw cops patrolling the streets. Mrs Byrd told Daily Mail Online that the election of the first African American mayor should be celebrated instead of focusing on the departures of city employees. Randall Ramsey, the outgoing mayor who has spent 36 years in the job, told the Daily Mail Online he also has no idea why the group quit. Tyrus Byrd (right) was sworn into office in Parma last week, but her election victory was overshadowed by the reported departure of the majority of the police force, the city's attorney, clerk and water treatment supervisor . Randall Ramsey, (pictured center with a past City Board) the outgoing mayor who has spent 36 years in the job over two terms, told the Daily Mail Online he has no idea why the group quit. The new mayor's father Simon Wofford (far right), who was defeated in the election for his seat, says she had a good relationship with the force . He added that most of the officers are part time and work for other towns in the surrounding area. He told KFVS that the officers cited 'safety concerns' when they resigned. Barry Aycock, who has served as an alderman, told the Daily Mail Online the election and the consequences are the same as usual and he hardly sees the police out on patrol. He added there is little crime in the city, aside from a spate or burglaries in recent weeks. There are around 700 people living in the community (Broad Street pictured) and, according to a 2010 US Census Bureau, 57 per cent are white and 41 per cent are black .","Tyrus Byrd was elected into office in the small city of Parma last week .

"A man charged with assassinating Russian opposition leader Boris Nemstov has told a court he was beaten and pressured into confessing to the murder. Zaur Dadaev is accused of being involved in the shooting of the politician in Moscow on February 27, along with four other Chechan men. Now Russian news agencies have quoted him as telling the court that he had been abducted, beaten and pressured into confessing to Nemstov's murder. Zaur Dadaev spoken to the court in Moscow via a video link from his prison cell. Dadaev had previously confessed to Boris Nemstov's murder but now says he was beaten and pressured into make that statement . Dadaev is one of five Chechan men who have been accused of killing the opposition leader. Nemstov was shot in the back four times on a bridge close to the Kremlin in February, sparking a huge protest march in Moscow . Dadaev was the only one, according to a judge and investigators, who confessed to the killing. When he appeared in court in March, Dadaev didn't admit his guilt for the murder, and later retracted his confession. Human rights activist Andrei Babushkin, who visited the suspect in jail last month, said he had seen signs of torture on Dadaev's body. Zaur Dadaev retracted his confession for the murder of Nemstov last month. A human rights activist said when he visited him in prison he had abrasions on his body and had suffered multiple injuries . Boris Nemstov was an outspoken critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin. It is understood at the time of his death he was working on a report examining Russia's military involvement in the east of Ukraine . But the Russian state-funded television network Russia Today claimed human rights activists had found no signs of torture on Dadaev's body when they visited him in custody. Dadaev is being held with his cousins, Anzor and Shagid Gubahsev. Khamzat Bakhayev and Tamerlan Eskerkhanov have also been accused of involvement in Nemstov's murder. The outspoken politician was shot in the back four times as he crossed a bridge near the Kremlin and Red Square in Moscow. More than 20,000 people marched through the capital city in protest of his murder, holding posters of his face and signs saying: 'I am not afraid'. An outspoken critic of Putin, investigators say they are still trying to work out who ordered Nemstov to be killed.","Zaur Dadaev is accused of shooting the Kremlin critic, close to Red Square .

"From the best night's kip being enjoyed on a Wednesday to rising the earliest on a Sunday, new data is giving fascinating insights into how the world sleeps. Using statistics from Sleep Cycle app users, researchers have discovered that the earliest wake-up time worldwide is on a Monday in South Africa. While on Tuesdays, Americans rise at 7am and are in the worst mood all week. In terms of national average sleep quality, Slovakia topped the list.  The UK was in 45th place, while the US was in 49th. The best sleep quality worldwide occurs on a Wednesday night. More than half (58 per cent) of countries surveyed said they had the most restful sleep on this day . Other countries that wake-up grumpy on Tuesdays include Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, South Africa and Brazil. The Sleep Cycle app tracks a user's sleep as they go through a cycle of sleep phases. It uses the phone's accelerometer to identify phases by tracking movements in bed and wakes users up during their lightest sleep phase, using a pre-defined 30-minute alarm window. It has more than two million active users and gathered data for the study between 1 June 2014 and 31 March this year from users aged 18 to 55 in 47 countries. Other insights from this data include that the best sleep quality worldwide occurs on a Wednesday night. Over the course of the week, people in Finland get the most hours sleep - on a Saturday with eight hours and two minutes, on average. On the same night, people in Japan get an average of just six hours and nine minutes sleep. This graph shows which days of the week countries sleep the most . More than half (58 per cent) of the countries surveyed said they had the most restful sleep on this day, with China recording the highest sleep quality in the world that night. On Thursdays, people in the Middle East wake the latest and the happiest, and in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and UAE in particular, users also reported the best mood on Thursdays. Despite waking up grumpy on Tuesdays, by Friday the US sleeps in the most and wakes up happiest. The data revealed Americans typically don't rise until 8:24am on Fridays and also report the best wake-up mood. MONDAY: The world wakes up earliest on Mondays with South Africa rising first at 6:09 am . TUESDAY: Americans rise early at 7am and are consequently in the worst mood all week. Other countries that also wake-up grumpy on Tuesdays include Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, South Africa and Brazil . WEDNESDAY: 58% of countries surveyed - including the US - experience sleep best on Wednesdays, with China recording the highest sleep quality in the world that night. THURSDAY: Middle East users sleep longer on Thursdays than any other day, and Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and UAE also report the best mood on Thursdays. FRIDAY: Americans sleep latest on Fridays, not rising until 8:24am. They also report the best wake-up mood. People in Costa Rica, Canada, New Zealand and Sweden also wake up the happiest on Friday. However, the majority of the world (71 per cent), wake up in the best mood on Saturdays. SATURDAY: Nearly 90% of countries surveyed sleep more and wake up later on Saturday compared to any other day of the week. SUNDAY:The majority of the world (66% of countries) spends the least amount of time in bed on Sundays. Topping the list is South Korea where users only sleep 5 hours and 53 minutes on Sunday nights.

"Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton haven't always seen eye-to-eye in the past 12 months but the pair appeared to be singing from the same hymn sheet on Thursday. Fresh from being beaten by Ferrari driver Sebastian Vettel at the Malaysian Grand Prix on March 29, the Mercedes team-mates have been collaborating with their team to ensure the prancing horse doesn't gallop to victory at the next race in China. The duo attended Mercedes' Brackley base in the hope to find a winning formula come race weekend in Shanghai on April 10-12.

Coming up with a plan to beat the red cars in shanghai! @MercedesAMGF1 @LewisHamilton,' Rosberg took to Twitter to upload a picture of he and Hamilton on a flight back from Brackley. Speaking after the race in Malaysia, Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff conceded that he was a worried man following the manner of Vettel's victory. Suggestions of another season of Mercedes domination in the wake of a comfortable one-two in the season-opening race in Australia were blown apart by Ferrari and Vettel. The four-time world champion beat Hamilton by 8.5 seconds, with team-mate Nico Rosberg a further four seconds adrift in third. Mercedes boss Toto Wolff (right) was surprised by Sebastian Vettel's Malaysian Grand Prix victory . Wolff admitted that the German driver deserved to win and Ferrari got their tactics spot-on in the soaring heat . Despite searing heat of more than 30 degrees, Vettel's Ferrari was kinder on its tyres, stopping just twice compared to three for both Hamilton and Rosberg. And afterwards Wolff admitted: 'We were pretty sure the three-stop strategy would work for us. 'We probably went a bit too aggressive on set-up, which pushed us into a direction of a three-stop. 'But in the circumstances, with the high temperatures, they were able to go at a faster pace over long runs than us. 'We need to analyse why that was the case, and it clearly shows it's not going to be an easy one. 'It is clear they won the race, which is worrying. It wouldn't be right to say we lost it.'

"Hong Kong (CNN)There's a booming black market in Hong Kong, but it's not for fake Apple Watches, or the iPhone. Instead, people are going crazy for tins of butter cookies. Tourists and locals line up around the block for several hours just to get their hands on Jenny's cookies -- at $9 a tin. Its popularity has spurred bakeries to make and sell knockoffs, and the original store has signs warning against buying 'fake' Jenny's cookies. The tiny shop, located in Tsim Sha Tsui, one of the city's main shopping districts, is swarming with people handing over wads of cash for the ""little bear cookies"" as they are known across Asia. People are even hired to stand in line to buy the goods and are later resold at a 70% mark-up yards away, something the bakery also tries to discourage. A few meters away from the long cookie line, old ladies hold up paper signs advertising the cookies for sale. But when they see cameras approaching, they scurry away, only to reappear on another street corner. The frenzy in Hong Kong over the buttery treats is by no means an isolated example. In other parts of the world, food mania has erupted, swiftly winning people's hearts and stomachs, only to fizzle out in a few months. From cronuts to ramen burgers, here are some foods that people around the world have spent hours of their lives waiting for.

"(CNN)This week, Hillary Clinton surprised the world yet again — not with the official launch of her campaign but for the unconventional way she did it. She sure pushed the envelope. With her video, new logo and road trip, she opened a long communications campaign not only to ""rebrand"" herself but to completely reframe who she is, what she stands for and how she intends to run. We'll find out over the next year and a half whether it will work. Many in the press and on late-night television scratched their heads this week; others were scathing. Ruth Marcus --  a  columnist for the Washington Post -- dismissed her launch video as a ""relentlessly, insultingly vapid"" effort of ""demographic box-checking."" Jon Stewart lampooned it as a ""State Farm commercial gone viral"" and also ""boring as s---."" Since the media will likely be the stand-in primary opponent for Hillary, their belief in her authenticity is a critical factor in whether she can reframe herself in voter's eyes. But from a marketing perspective, her launch may have been much more successful than critics think. The YouTube announcement video took on the central strategic challenge for the campaign and candidate: To flip Clinton's message from self-absorbed ""I"" to empathetic ""we."" While critics may sneer, it is hard to deny that the image it projects of Hillary is more confident, fresher, simpler and forward-looking, with even a bit of the upstart feel of two of the most successful product launch companies, Nike and Apple. Clinton's team may have begun to create an empathetic relationship with voters that has eluded her in the past, most crucially when she lost the nomination fight to Barack Obama in 2008. In marketing terms, rebranding is a strategy to bring a new name, term, symbol or design to an established brand with the aim of developing a new identity in the minds of consumers. Reframing is a strategy that goes further: it seeks to change how a consumer (or voter) emotionally experiences an established brand. A rebrand may change how you think about a brand; a reframe may change how you feel about it.  In the Apple case, the company at one time fell on its face when it unveiled the original Macintosh; some thought the company was headed for oblivion. But when Steve Jobs returned as CEO, he went back to the drawing board and soon unveiled the iPod, which not only changed the way consumers thought about Apple, but how they experienced it. Not only a rebrand -- but a reframe. Take Hillary's road trip to Iowa in the van nicknamed Scooby. The press lampooned her, but I would bet that for many others, her unscripted and anonymous stop at Chipotle reinforced the ""everyday Americans"" campaign theme. Hillary stood in line to order, an everyday customer among everyday people at an everyday fast-food chain. Also introduced last week was what will come to be the single most-ubiquitous element of her campaign: Clinton's new and controversial  campaign logo. It is a brilliant, iconic expression of the emotional connection she wants people to have with her, her message and her movement.  In fact, her logo is all about movement. Simple, confident, high tech and shorthand to a much younger set of voters, the bold red arrow moving left to right in front of the strong blue H says it all: You are the important ones. I'm here to support you with everything I've got. Let me help you move forward. Taken together, all the pieces of Clinton's announcement -- as well as the unconventional media she used to deliver them -- bring her back on stage not as a leader from yesterday but, surprisingly, as one for the future. Coincidentally, the way Marco Rubio announced his run for the Republican nomination most likely amplified the impact of Clinton's reframing. For all his posturing about being the new generation, Rubio followed to a ""T"" the most traditional script for announcing a candidacy: traditional stage and podium, dark suit, bright tie, wife and kids on camera, a live speech, all about himself, timed for the evening news. Rubio's logo, the signature of his image, drew immediate criticism for being amateurish and unconsidered, even leaving Alaska and Hawaii off the map of America. In stark contrast, Hillary showed the confidence and finesse to buck tradition on every front. It was Hillary who pulled the ultimate jiu-jitsu. There are those, of course, who will be alienated, if not disgusted, by the way her campaign has unfurled such a sophisticated marketing plan. In a day when voters are yearning for authenticity, how do we know this is the real Hillary or a candidate in a mask?  Fair question. But for better or worse, mass marketing has become the staple of presidential campaigns -- that's where most campaign dollars go. Both sides know how to play, sometimes brilliantly.  Remember the Reagan advertisements of 1984, proclaiming ""Morning in America""? What we know is that over time, voters see a lot of unscripted moments of a candidate where the real character comes through. And if they spot hypocrisy between ads and the candidate, that campaign will get into trouble fast. That's why the key to Hillary Clinton's success in reframing her message and movement will be consistency.  She must not only take the essence of a humble, empathic relationship with voters and integrate it into all elements of her communication, she must also live it every day. Otherwise there will be messaging ""schizophrenia,"" the solid start with flashes of brilliance will peter out and she'll be facing the same voter perceptions that doomed her race in 2008. In the meantime, one can imagine Clinton getting a huge, satisfying belly laugh out of the early returns on her efforts.","Martha Pease: Hillary Clinton got her presidential bid launched by reframing who she is, what she's about .

"A woman who tipped the scales at almost 20st has shed nearly half her body weight after she was forced to stand during an 11-hour flight - because she feared she was crushing the woman in the seat next to her. Sharon Smith, 43, from Halesowen, West Midlands, was a bulky size 26 when she went on the business trip in December 2012 and struggled to fit in the plane seat. Today she weighs in at a healthy 9st 9lb and is due to run a 10k race on Sunday, when two years she would have struggled to walk half a mile, let alone run six. Scroll down for video . Sharon Smith shed almost half her body weight after she decided to take up running . Sharon said she lost 4st through joining a slimming club but then shed another four-and-a-half stone after taking up her sporty hobby. Her weight loss began just under two years ago when she joined Weight Watchers Online, but did not weigh herself immediately. After six months of following the plan, she was 18st 6lb so estimates that when she started she was 'way over 20st' and a size 26. She said that although she had always been larger she had never been happy being overweight. Sharon said: 'I was never one of those people who was okay being big, it had always upset me but my head wasn't in the right place to do anything about it because I had a busy working life.' She put her unhealthy lifestyle down to commuting to London for her job as a children's clothes designer for Aquascutum which saw her do minimal exercise. At her heaviest Sharon was over 20st and a size 26 but she has now slimmed down to 9st 9lbs and is a size 10 . But the turning point came for Sharon after having to 'squeeze' her bulky frame into seats on trains and planes. 'I started commuting to London in August 2012 and the business trip to Hong Kong was in December that year,' she said. 'I had been travelling out there for ten years but luckily I had always managed to upgrade or have no one in the seat next to me. 'But this trip coming back I was in economy and it is the one that really sticks out in my memory. 'I remember being rammed in my seat with a lady next to me. I felt uncomfortable not just for me but for her too. Sharon says her weight was down to to commuting to London for her job as a clothes designer but after quitting her job to go freelance and work from home, Sharon was able to exercise at lunch . 'I ended up standing for the entire flight with my iPod in. 'I was genuinely worried I might hurt the woman in the next seat because of my weight. She didn't say anything but I just didn't think it fair for her to suffer because of my size. 'The flight attendant even offered me the seats they use for take-off and landing. But with the big long-haul jets there is more room to stand.' But even back in the UK, she was fed-up of the daily humiliation of her long journeys to work. She said; 'On top of this, every time I went to London I was fed up having to squeeze into train seats.' Sharon made small changes to her lifestyle, such as walking around London rather than taking the Tube, and in January 2014, she decided to quit her high-flying job and go freelance. She began working from her home which meant she could go for a walk every lunchtime. Sharon took up running last March and by now was around 13st to 14st and finding it difficult to lose any more weight. Friends were talking about the 'Couch to 5k' beginners running programme so she started doing that and signed up for a 5k Race for Life, which she did last July in an impressive 40 minutes. After getting a taste for activity Sharon joined a runners' website, The Running Bug, which 'changed her life' as she was egged on by other enthusiasts. Sharon added: 'The site, especially the members' forum, gave me so many tips and so much encouragement.' Sharon took part in a 5k Race for Life which she completed in just 40 minutes . The designer has since completed two 10k runs last year and even ran the Brighton half marathon in two hours and 59 seconds in February this year. Sharon, who is also running the Morrisons Great Birmingham 10k run this Sunday, added: 'The weight loss really picked up when I started running, it really helped with the momentum. 'Once I started training for my first 10k race last summer, the pounds really dropped off. 'I think it was a mix of things that caused the problems, I knew my diet wasn't healthy. 'At the weekends I tended to graze the whole day through so there wouldn't be that many minutes when I wasn't eating, it was constantly chocolate and crisps. 'Now I don't buy any processed foods, I don't even buy ready-made bread and I try to make everything from scratch. 'I eat a lot more fruit and veg and try to eat health fats like nuts.'","Children's clothes designer Sharon Smith, 43, weighed over 20st .

"Armenia is a country in Eurasia's South Caucasus region famous for its mountainous landscapes and rich history ... but mainly, right now at least, for the fact Kim Kardashian and her posse are there. Kim Kardashian, her husband Kanye West, their daughter North and Kim's sister Khloe arrived in the capital Yerevan on Wednesday to a rock star welcome and over eight days are checking out a plethora of local landmarks. The visit is their first to the country their late father, Robert Kardashian, fled for America and both Kim and Khloe have expressed their excitement at the chance to explore his homeland. Kim Kardashian is in Armenia with her husband Kanye West and their daughter North on an eight-day visit to the country of her dad's birth . The celebrity visitors are in the capital Yerevan, a culturally rich city where the Opera House (centre) is among its most notable landmarks . The Yerevan Opera House is a must-visit place in the Armenian capital where local music and dance performances are highly regarded . Kim, Kanye and Khloe Kardashian are staying at the Armenia Marriott Hotel Yerevan which is on Republic Square, formerly Lenin Square . Republic Square is a tourist attraction in itself, with its combination of Soviet-era architecture and Neo-Classical official buildings . And from what Lonely Planet says of the city, it's made for the icons of modern-day entertainment. 'While it's the undeniable cultural, economic and political heart of the nation, Yerevan can at times feel like a city on permanent holiday,' Lonely Planet's introduction to its guide of the city. 'All summer long, Yerevanites saunter up and down the main boulevards, preening in high fashion and fast cars while occasionally popping into a parkside cafe to schmooze over a drink or two.' Sounds familiar... While there, the Kardashian-West crew are staying in the capital's finest digs, the Armenia Marriott Hotel Yerevan, which frames Republic Square at the heart of the city, and have the burliest of bodyguards and police in tow as they take in the sights. But what would we, the mere mortals not of reality TV fame, see and do if we followed in their footsteps? Yerevan's Zvartnots International Airport is well connected to major centres throughout Europe although cheaper flights (upwards of £300 during summer and less in colder months) from London require a transfer somewhere like Moscow, Kiev or Vienna. Without the need to book out the two executive floors of the hotel for our entourage and filming crew, as the Kardashian crew have, a standard room from 67,150 Armenian Drams is good value (sounds like a lot but works out at about £96). A smartphone view of the Katoghiken church in the World Heritage-listed Geghard Monastery, where Kim, Kanye and North visited . The monastery is a medieval set of structures which have in part been carved out of the mountain and date back to the fourth century . Documenting every moment: Camera crews followed the family as they took a tour of historical sites . Outside the Monastery of Geghard women sell the same traditional sweet bread that was offered to Kim on their arrival in Armenia . The hotel is well chosen by their people as it's right in the middle of this relatively easy to get around city, where the majority of main sights are free. The square is a tourist attraction in itself, with its combination of Soviet-era architecture and Neo-Classical buildings such as the Houses of Government and the Marriott itself, but with their own Armenian twists. In the heart of the cultural and business hub of Yerevan, the square is connected to the other main area of the city that has the impressive Opera House at its centre. While Kanye's hip-hop may not be the preferred genre of the nation - fans appear to be more interested in the stars of Keeping Up with the Kardashians - the city isn't short on culture with a disproportionately large amount of theatres, galleries and clubs for its size, with plenty of live music to be found. Their minders say the timing has nothing to do with it, but the Kardashians' arrival comes as the nation counts down to the 100th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide on April 24 which honours up 1.5 million people were killed by the Ottomans between 1915 and 1917. Turkey dispute the figures - they claim 300,000 to 500,000 Armenians died during a civil uprising against the Ottomans - but Armenians have fought for international recognition of the tragedy for decades. But the memory of those whose lives were taken are very much honoured in this city and throughout the country. The Cascades is the main part of the Cafesjian Museum, found in the centre of Yerevan, which features an array of  modern  Armenian art . Khachkars, an Armenian cross stone, are common features of medieval Christian art found in the Cascades . The Sculture Park features works from Botero and other internationally-recognised artists and a stellar view of the city . This statue at the Cascades represents Russian-born architect Alexander Tamanian, whose greatest work was planning modern Yerevan . Among the major sights on the Kardashian's itinerary is Yerevan's extensive Armenian Genocide Museum-Institute http://www.genocide-museum.am/eng/index.php along with the National Archives where they hope to see documents relating to their ancestors. The party has already visited Yerevan's Mother Armenia statue, a large representation of a women holding a big sword that is said to be the female personification of the country and proved quite an inspiration for the sisters. A visit to their father's home city of Gyumri would find a smaller version of the statue minus the collection of decommissioned tanks, rocket launchers and other military items. 'The Mother Armenia statue symbolizes peace through strength,' Khloe wrote on Instagram. 'It can remind viewers of some of the prominent female figures in Armenian history. Who took up arms to help their husbands in their clashes with Turkish troops and Kurdish irregulars. I am woman hear me roar! Blessed to be here!' Victory Park, home to the statue, also offers a brilliant view of the city . Kim echoed the sentiment: 'This statue reminds visitors of the strong female figures in Armenian history. I love how powerful women are and respected so much in our culture!' The huge Mother Armenia statue (said to be the female personification of the nation) and military museum at Victory Park in Yerevan . While there said to be more Armenians living abroad than in the country itself, due to millions who fled the alleged genocide, local culture has been diligently preserved. Their welcome to a packed airport included a traditional gift of bread and salt from women in traditional Armenian dress. Similar breads are found sold by locals at the Unesco World Heritage-listed Monastery of Geghard, a medieval set of structures which have in part been carved out of the mountain where where Kim and Kanye have taken North. The main chapel was built in 1215 but the complex originated in the fourth century and has a rich and varied history. Other sights include the 3,000-year-old Erebuni Fortress that was the beginning of Yerevan and the more modern Cascades, Sculpture Park and Cafesjian Museum, their modern art centre. Or romantics could visit Lover's Park, a Japanese-style garden which hosts open-air concerts and art exhibitions. While a minority are unimpressed with the celebrities' arrival most are delighted to see them, including the government. The group has met with the nation's prime minister Hovik Abrahamyan, who praised their contribution to 'international recognition and condemnation of the Armenian genocide.' Parliament speaker Galust Saakian said their visit can only be a good thing. 'Kim Kardashian is a lady who's known worldwide. We should be happy she came here,' he said. The Kardashian family tree has rich historical roots in Armenia . Robert Kardashian, father of Kim, Kourtney, Khloe and Robert Jr, was a third-generation Armenian American. The celebrity lawyer, who passed away in 2003 just eight weeks after being diagnosed with oesophageal cancer, passed on his pride in his heritage to his family, who have been vocal about their Armenian roots. Robert's ancestors fled the Armenian Genocide in the early 20th century, thanks to a 'prophet' who urged them to uproot to America. Known at the time as the Kardaschoffs, in Russian style, the family made their way from their home village of Karakale in the late 19th Century to German ports. From there, they travelled to a new life in America on the passenger vessels SS Brandenberg and SS Koln. By doing so, they escaped the triple horror of the First World War from 1914-18, the 'Armenian Genocide' starting in 1915 - exactly a century ago this year - and the Russian Revolution in 1917. Among those fleeing Erzurum - then in Armenia, and ruled by last Russian Tsar Nicholas II - was family patriarch Hovhannes Miroyan and Kim's great great grandfather, born in 1844. He married  Luciag Chorbajian, born in 1853. The couple wed in Erzurum, which is now in Turkey, in 1867 but escaped along with their daughter Vartanoosh Mironyan, born in 1886, in the early 20th century. Vartanoosh's distinctly blonde daughter Haigoohi Arakelian, known as Helen, was born in America in 1917, the year the Bolshevik Revolution rocked the Russian Empire. She was Kim's grandmother, who later married into the Kardashian clan. The glamorous and 'dynamic' Helen wed Arthur who ran the largest meat-packing business in southern California. Helen's son Robert married Kris Houghton and fathered the 21st Century's biggest reality TV stars Kourtney, Khloe, Robert Jr and Kim. Their mother Kris eventually married Olympic gold medalist Bruce Jenner and together they raised two more TV personalities, Kendall and Kylie.","Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, along with their daughter North and sister Khloe, are visiting Armenia .

"A couple who married in their teens and suffer from cystic fibrosis are in a race against time as the young wife waits for a life-saving lung transplant. Katie Prager, 24, was diagnosed with an infection in her lungs in September 2009 and is desperately in need of a transplant as doctors predicted she would not live a year without new lungs. As her health continues to decline, her husband Dalton, 23, who has already received new lungs, is pleading for help. Her insurance company, Kentucky Medicaid, will not pay for the out-of-state treatment she needs at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, he says. Dalton pleaded: 'They are turning my wife into a number, a statistic, a dollar sign. I cannot lose her. This can’t be the end of our love story. 'We are both ready to continue fighting but at this point we are running out of options and need your help. Please help me save my wife Katie.' Scroll down for video . Katie and Dalton Prager (above), who suffer from cystic fibrosis, followed their hearts and married as teens in 2011 . Katie, left, was diagnosed with an infection in her lungs called Burkholderia Cepacia, and is desperately in need of a transplant as doctors predicted she would not live a year without new lungs . Dalton has already received new lungs, but Katie is waiting as Kentucky Medicaid will not pay for the out-of-state-treatment she needs at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center . For the couple who put everything on the line when they first met in person in 2009, her husband can not imagine losing the love of his life who he married four years ago. In December 2014, Katie was discharged from the Pittsburgh hospital after a long stay and returned to Kentucky, but began having trouble breathing three days later. The hospital would not admit her because Medicare would not pay because she had used her lifetime maximum, the couple says. She will not be covered for the expensive out-of-state medical procedure again until she spends 60 consecutive days out of the hospital. She was admitted into University of Kentucky Hospital, but it however, does not do transplants on patients with the kind of infection that Katie has. 'Sixty days out of the hospital is not an option for her anymore. Medicaid is also not an option as it will not cover her transplant due to UPMC being 'out of network',' Dalton wrote on the couple's YouCaring page. 'After explaining to Medicaid and Pittsburgh that there are only two places in the country, who would operate, due to (the bacteria) Cepacia, (UPMC and Duke Medical Center) still refused to work together to help her. 'She is struggling to attempt to negotiate her healthcare options from her hospital bed at the University of Kentucky.' Dalton said: 'They are turning my wife into a number, a statistic, a dollar sign. I cannot lose her. This can’t be the end of our love story' Only three months away from their four-year anniversary, the couple has not been together since November 2014 when Dalton received new lungs, and hope they can be together to celebrate . Katie said that she feels like efforts to get transferred to Pittsburgh are at a standstill and that something needs to be done. 'It needs to happen soon. Nervous they aren't going to accept my case and that I'll have to restart this whole process at a completely different hospital,' she wrote on the couple's Facebook page. In February, Dr. Michael Anstead who is Katie's pulmonologist at the University of Kentucky, wrote a letter to Medicaid seeking for them to make an exception and pay for Katie's care in Pittsburgh, according to CNN. But Kentucky Medicaid denied the proposal saying UPMC declined to enroll as a Kentucky Medicaid provider. 'Medicaid policies allow for a simplified enrollment process for out-of-state providers in such situations,' Gwenda Bond, spokeswoman for the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services wrote in a statement to CNN. 'Should UPMC reverse its decision and choose to enroll as a Kentucky Medicaid provider, the Department for Medicaid Services...will be happy to expedite their application.' However, the hospital claims that Medicaid told them if they wanted to treat Katie, they would be required to sign up hundreds of doctors to accept Kentucky Medicaid patients. 'UPMC wants to help Katie, and our physicians and staff have done everything possible to make that happen...It is up to Kentucky Medicaid to address this situation,' wrote spokeswoman Wendy Zellner. So far, the couple relies on communication on phones and computers to keep in touch . UPMC said they are want to help Katie but said it is up to Kentucky Medicaid to address the situation . While Katie seems to be caught in limbo, the director of the media relations group at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said they are working to find a solution concerning her case by reaching out to the state agency. Only three months away from their four year anniversary in July, the couple have not been together since November 2014 when Dalton received his lung transplant at UPMC. Even though he also had Cepacia like Katie, which makes lung transplants more complicated, his has been a success. However, he has not been able to be near his wife in person until she receives a lung transplant because of the risk of infection. So far, they rely on communication through their phones or computers. But all they want is to be able to spend their anniversary together. 'I just want to make it to see our four year anniversary in July and be able to hold hands and just hug,' Katie told CNN. 'That's all I really want -- to be able to hug my husband on our fourth anniversary.' So far, the couple's YouCaring page has raised $43,425 in donations out of its goal of $50,000.","Katie and Dalton Prager, 24 and 23, met in 2009 and married two years later .

"Child sexual abuse reports have soared since Operation Yewtree which was sparked by Jimmy Savile's assaulting of dozens of children . Reports of child sex abuse cases have risen by more than 60 per cent in the wake of investigations such as Operation Yewtree and the Rotherham scandal. Figures revealed thousands more people had contacted police with allegations of abuse since 2011, with nearly 9,000 reports filed in 2014. Despite a surge in reports, the number of arrests fell by nine per cent, prompting critics to accuse the Government of failing victims of abuse. Among the forces to see the largest rise in reported cases was South Yorkshire where there was a 577 per cent increase over the last five years. It comes after an estimated 1,400 children were abused in the area over several years, with officials in Rotherham ousted as a result of the scandal having been deemed not fit for purpose. While only 74 cases of child sex abuse were reported to the force in 2011, 501 were investigated in 2014, the figures, obtained via Freedom of Information request by The Guardian, revealed. But while a surge in the number of reports suggested victims felt more comfortable coming forward, a decrease in the number of arrests made prompted critics to accuse police of not doing enough. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper described the ratio of reported crimes to arrests as a 'national scandal'. 'This isn't a problem from the past. It is a growing problem the Government should be confronting right now. 'Victims of child sex abuse are being let down when alongside a 60 per cent increase in reports there has been a nine per cent drop in arrests for child sex abuse, as well as falling prosecutions and convictions for child abuse offences as the police are unable to keep up.' Shaun Wright, the former Police and Crime Commissioner of South Yorkshire Police, resigned over the force's handling of the Rotherham child abuse scandal . Thames Valley Police made 191 arrests in relation to child sex abuse - up from just 13 in 2011. Campaigners said the rise was indicative of increased awareness of child sexual abuse among the public. 'In recent years there has been a huge increase in awareness of child sexual abuse and it’s good that more people are coming forward,' Alan Wardle, NSPCC head of policy and public affairs, said. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the figures were a 'national scandal' 'Since the Operation Yewtree police investigation was launched in 2012, the NSPCC helpline has seen a huge rise in the number of victims willing to speak out, get support and help bring abusers to justice. 'In the year after Yewtree was launched there was an 81% increase in calls about sexual abuse to the NSPCC helpline and this surge continues. 'When children take the extremely difficult step of reporting abuse we need to ensure they are properly supported and get the help they need when they are brave enough to give evidence in court.' Operation Yewtree was sparked by revelations made in 2012 that the late comedian Jimmy Savile had sexually abused children and young women in the 1970s and 80s. The Scotland Yard investigation is understood to pursue three lines of inquiry. The first relates to Savile's crimes while the second to allegations made against him and other public figures. The third was set up to investigate reports made as a result of the high-profile Savile allegations.","Police have seen a surge in number of  child sex abuse cases since 2011 .

"An Australian teenager has told how she was raped twice on Christmas Eve in Bali while holidaying with her family - and has slammed Indonesian police for letting her attacker escape back to his native Nigeria. Audrey Pekin, 19, says she was attacked by a man, Henry Alafu, who she had met with other friends a few days earlier when he lured her to his remote home - and then assaulted her again in a taxi as she tried to flee. According to Channel 9's A Current Affair, the pair began drinking together at the Bounty Bar in Kuta, before moving to the nearby Sky Garden to continue the night. Scroll down for video . Audrey Pekin has detailed the alleged rape and attack she suffered while on a Christmas holiday to Bali with her family . Alafu lured Ms Pekin back to where his property away from the bustling tourist centre of the city, and brutally raped her on two separate occasions. Alafu told Ms Pekin a party was taking place a nearby villa, and the pair agreed to go to it together. According to ACA, during in taxi ride to the home, Ms Pekin began to feel unwell due to her type 1 diabetes. Once they arrived at the house, she was not put off by the lack of noticeable noise that suggested there was no party taking place, because her illness made it 'impossible to think', she told the show. Inside the house, Alafu locked the door and forced Ms Pekin to the bed where he allegedly attacked her. 'He went from a man to a monster,' Ms Pekin said. 'I can't quite describe the feeling, the sadness, to know what was about to happen and that I would or could not have done anything to stop it. 'I was literally shaking and drooling... I threw some very feeble punches, but I could not move my arms...I could not move anything.' After the first alleged attack, Ms Pekin said she desperately tried to escape. Alafu then followed her, and tormented her as she struggled to flee. She sought help from passing motorists and workers in a nearby service station, but Alafu allegedly told staff to ignore her and 'to stay out of it', the show reported. Ms Pekin believed she was safe when a cab picked her up, only for Alafu to force his way into the cab and again allegedly rape her. Henry Alafu is the man the Pekin family believed attacked their daughter . CCTV footage captured Alafu waiting in the lobby for Ms Pekin, as she stopped at the hotel before they continued with their night out. It was before the alleged attack took place . 'He kept trying to kiss me... he molested me in the back of the taxi for everyone, for the taxi driver, to see,' she claimed. 'He wouldn't stop.' Ms Pekin escaped the cab when it got back into the city of Kuta, when Alafu stalked after her again. 'He loped after me... he was laughing - he was taunting me,' she told ACA. It was only after another man, believed to be a fellow Australian, saw Ms Pekin was distressed and stepped in to help her. Ms Pekin said she tried to escaped from her alleged attacker by getting a cab back into the middle of Kuta, but he forced his way into the back of the car and  allegedly raped her a second time . 'I wish I could find that man... he deserves a medal, that man saved my life,' Ms Pekin said. Ms Pekin's sister, Frances, discovered her on the floor of her hotel room hours later. 'She wasn't even on the bed - she was next to the bed crying, shaking... in that moment I knew something, the worst had happened,' Frances Pekin said, according to the report. The family rushed Ms Pekin to hospital, where doctors found her entire body covered in bruises. 'He was crushing me, he nearly suffocated me... He could have killed me,' Ms Pekin said. 'It's so hard to get justice here,' Dawn Pekin (left) said. 'Men like him will cross path with many women. Don't think it can't happen to you' The 19-year-old then had a 'virginity test' at Sanglah Hospital, which she said was similar to a 'third assault'. 'The test was horrible, It was invasive... It was painful.' The test not only confirmed to police Ms Pekin had been raped, but it also revealed she had contracted a sexually transmitted infection in the attack. The Pekin family's torment was worsened by the fact the alleged predator was allowed to escape the country, and remains on-the-run. Alafu lured Ms Pekin back to where his property away from the bustling tourist centre of the city, and brutally raped her on two separate occasions,  according to ACA . A number of Facebook posts by Alafu, under a different name, including a picture he uploaded of the two together the night before, led to the Pekins family to believe it 'evident' he was the man who allegedly attacked their daughter. Police were in possession of Alafu's phone number, Facebook profile and current address, but the Pekin family says they did not do enough. 'It's just so hard to know what to do,' Ms Pekin's father, Karl, said. 'It's incredibly frustrating... They could have picked him up - he was still a threat. 'It's clear who he was, clear where he was, so we don't know why he wasn't picked up.' It was not until January 12, 18 days after the alleged attack, an attempt to arrest the Nigerian national. 'We're terrified. He's still free - we don't know if he is going to rock up on our doorstep,' Ms Pekin said . Four of Alafu's friends were arrested in a raid on the property on January 14, however it is believed he had escaped by that point. Police tracking revealed his phone was later used in Jakarta before being deactivated. His Facebook account was later opened from Nigeria. The Pekin family was paid more than $14,000 in legal fees over four days to proceed with the case. 'I think Bali is a lawless country,' Ms Pekin said. 'It has laws when it feels like it.' Police were in possession of Alafu's phone number, Facebook profile and current address . The family also called on the Australian government to help bring their daughter's attacker to justice. 'The Indonesian authorities have asked us why the AFP hasn't done anything, and it's a good question,' Mr Pekin said. The AFP said it did not have jurisdiction in the case, according to A Current Affair. According to the report, the Department of Foreign Affairs said it supplied comprehensive consular assistance to the family, but would not comment on an active investigation. 'It's incredibly frustrating... They could have picked him up - he was still a threat.'It's clear who he was, clear where he was, so we don't know why he wasn't picked up,' Mr Pekin said . The Pekin family said the country's lax policing of the problem means it is only a matter of time before another similar attack occurs. 'If you can rape a woman in Bali and just walk straight out of the country, that's not a deterrent, that's an invitation,' Dawn Pekin told the program. 'Either you get a cheap holiday, or you can have a safe one,' the 19-year-old Ms Pekin said. 'You can't have both.' Interpol was notified last week that Alafu is a wanted man. The Pekins are currently waiting for Interpol to issue a red notice for his arrest, which would allow the Australian government to push for Mr Alafu's arrest.

"Players' chief Gordon Taylor insists Raheem Sterling is not being disloyal to Liverpool by putting any further talks about a new contract on hold until the summer. The 20-year-old England player has been made what manager Brendan Rodgers described as 'an incredible offer', believed to be £100,000-a-week, but negotiations have ended in stalemate. Sterling has insisted he is not a 'money grabber' and Taylor, chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association, believes waiting until the season is over before resuming talks could be a wise move. Raheem Sterling admitted in a TV interview that he is not ready to sign a new contract at Liverpool . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers described the £100,000-a-week contract offer as an 'incredible offer' PFA Chief executive Gordon Taylor has defended Sterling for postponing contract negotiations . Taylor said: 'I don't think it's meant to be a sign of disloyalty to Liverpool. 'Even Steven Gerrard, a Liverpool man all his career, had to think about his situation from time to time when there was a great deal of interest in him from other clubs. 'As a player with two years left on his contract he's obviously entitled to consider his options. 'It is a little bit untidy however when the negotiating is taking place in the full glare of the media. 'It's the nature of the game now and it is not necessarily a bad thing for both the club and the player to concentrate on football and leave things on the contract until the end of the season. Sterling has been linked with a move to Arsenal and leading clubs in Spain . Sterling scored for England in their Euro 2016 qualifier with Lithuania on Friday evening .

"Living near congested roads with high levels of air pollution can cause ‘silent strokes’ which increase the risk of dementia, scientists have warned. Exposure to small, sooty particles, mostly caused by traffic fumes and factory emissions, alters the structure of the brain, they said. The microscopic particles have previously been shown to cause lung damage and harmful changes in blood vessels and clotting, and are thought to contribute to the deaths of 29,000 people every year in Britain. Living near a congested road can increase the chance of developing dementia, research has found . Researchers examined the brains of more than 900 people aged more than 60 and assessed the pollution risk . US researchers found evidence that living near congested roads or polluted areas can lead to ‘silent strokes’ which in turn cause shrinkage of the brain and other damage. Silent strokes, which arise from blockages in blood vessels supplying the brain, do not have any outward symptoms and the victim is usually unaware of them. Sudha Seshadri, a professor of neurology at Boston University School of Medicine, said: ‘This is concerning, since we know that silent strokes increase the risk of overt strokes and of developing dementia, walking problems and depression. ‘We now plan to look more at the impact of air pollution over a longer period, its effect on brain shrinkage over time, and other risks including stroke and dementia.’ The study, by Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Boston University School of Medicine, involved more than 900 people aged 60 and over who did not have dementia or a history of strokes. It recorded how far participants lived from major roads and used satellite imagery to assess their exposure to the fine particulate matter known as PM2.5. This is made up of small particles measuring just 2.5 micrometres, or 30 times smaller than the thickness of a human hair. These particles are generated from a variety of sources, including power plants, factories, trucks and cars and the burning of wood. They can travel deeply into the lungs and have been associated with increased numbers of hospital admissions for heart attacks and strokes. The study participants’ brain matter was measured using MRI scans. The researchers found that increases in PM2.5 in towns and cities was linked with a 46 per cent higher risk of silent strokes. The research was published in a report in the journal Stroke. Researcher Elissa Wilker, of the Cardiovascular Epidemiology Research Unit at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, said: ‘This is one of the first studies to look at the relationship between ambient air pollution and brain structure. ‘Our findings suggest that air pollution is associated with insidious effects, even in dementia and stroke-free individuals. ‘The mechanisms remain unclear, but inflammation resulting from the deposit of fine particles in the lungs is likely important.’ The study will add to mounting pressure on the Government, which faces a judgment at the Supreme Court next week over its failure to meet EU legal limits for air pollution. Sixteen cities – including London, Manchester, Glasgow, Sheffield and Birmingham – have failed to hit air quality targets.","American researchers examined more than 900 people aged 60 and over .

"A family-friendly coffee shop had its Facebook page hacked and flooded with pornography after an employee clicked on a malicious link in an email. Staff at Scooter's Coffee, in Omaha, were locked out of the page for almost 24 hours, starting at 5pm on Sunday, by an 'unknown third party' who then took control of the picture feed. Instead of the usual images of smoothies, coffees and cookies, the page was plastered with adult cartoons - similar to those posted on Delta Air Lines and Crayola's pages after they were hacked. Scooter's Coffee, Omaha, issued this apology to customers on its Facebook page after it was hijacked by hackers for 24 hours who used it to post pornography . Scooter's said that the images which appeared on their Facebook page were similar to the images that were posted on Crayola's page when they were hacked in January (pictured) From 5pm Sunday until almost the same time the next day, followers of the Scooter's Facebook page were sent links such as this one, instead of the regular images of smoothies and cookies . After trying to contact officials at Facebook with limited success, it was not until a day later that the company managed to kick the hacker out, and regain control of the account. Jamie Hamburg, spokesman for the company, said: 'At approximately 5pm CST on Sunday, 29 March, the Scooter's Coffee Facebook page was hacked by an unknown third party. 'The offensive content that has been posted as a result of this hack is similar to that seen in other recent breaches of major brands. 'Scooter's Coffee would like to apologize to our loyal Facebook audience and anyone that has been affected by this inappropriate content.' The hack is believed to have come after an employee clicked on a link of a direct message sent through Facebook itself. The hacker then kicked the member of staff out of the page, locked it, and began posting. Scooter's Coffee said that, despite repeated attempts to contact Facbook, and hundreds of reports being sent about inappropriate content, nobody at the social media network responded. It was only by contacting larger businesses that they were able to get in touch with Facebook, who removed the content and restored the page nearly 24 hours later. All of the images have now been removed, and Scooter's have offered apologies to thier customers via their Facebook and Twitter pages . It is thought that the hack occurred after an employee clicked on a link in an email which purported to be from Facebook. Hackers were then able to gather enough data to allow them to take control of the page . Crayon manufacturer Crayola was caught out by a similar breach in January, when hackers took control of the page to post pictures of cartoon breasts, and links to adult websites. One post included a link to a drawing of a scantily clad female cartoon character from the DreamWorks movie 'The Road to El Dorado' - with the words 'If Disney Was For Adults.' Delta Air Lines was also affected the following month in a similar attack involving a link to a sexually explicit joke. Their page was hijacked for around an hour, during which 'objectionable and offensive content', similar to that in the Crayola and Scooter's hacks, was published.","Staff were locked out of Scooter's Coffee page starting at 5pm on Sunday .

"The future of travel will be virtual. Never again will you need to board a plane to be able to take in the world's most breathtaking locales, at least if Facebook has anything to say about it. In a recent Q&A on the social media site, CEO and co-founder, Mark Zuckerberg, opened up about the future of travel and how virtual reality will play a key role. According to Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, the future of travel lies in sharing virtual reality environments . 'It will be pretty wild,' Zuckerberg replied to a follower online, according to arynews.tv. 'Just like we capture photos and videos today and then share them on the Internet to let others experience them too, we'll be able to capture whole 3D scenes and create new environments and then share those with people as well.' Zuckerberg's views of the future of virtual travel are perhaps unsurprising, considering that the social media giant purchased virtual reality headset maker, Oculus, last year. And at a conference in San Francisco last month, Facebook's chief technology officer, Mike Schroepfer, promised that virtual reality gaming would be coming 'this year.' Never again will you need to endure a long-haul flight to take in some of Thailand's best beaches . Thanks to the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset, users will be able to see the world from multiple viewpoints . Facebook also announced plans to begin supporting virtual reality on its newsfeed, meaning that users will be able to put on a VR headset and explore a location of their choosing. These videos are expected to be filmed with multiple cameras, so users will be able to change their viewpoints, allowing for even more in-depth exploration. Described as a 'first step,' it's also believed that even more immersive videos are on the horizon, including those which will use Oculus Rift, the virtual reality headset that straps over your eyes. 'VR is more than just another platform, it can create a whole range of human experiences,' said Michael Abrash, the Chief Scientist at Oculus. The Facebook founder isn't the first to predict virtual reality as the future of travel. Marriott hotels have already trialled Oculus Rift on a tour of hotels across America, allowing guests to sample different holiday destinations.","In recent Facebook Q&A, Zuckerberg discussed the future of travel .

"A 17 year-old college student could face a battle with Instagram after hacking the popular photo-sharing app. Caleb Benn, a Californian high school student, recently developed a $4.99 (£3.24) app for iOS devices using Instagram's application program interface. Called 'Uploader for Instagram', it allows users to upload photos to Instagram directly from their computer rather than using only their smartphone. Caleb Benn, a Californian high school student, has developed a $4.99 (£3.24) app for iOS devices using Instagram's application program interface (screen shot pictured). Now, the 17 year-old student could face a battle with Instagram over hackings its API . According Jillian Eugenios at CNNMoney, the teenager is currently making $1,000 (£675.70) a day from the app – and Instagram isn't happy. An engineer from Facebook, which owns Instagram, sent Benn an email last week claiming the app violated the company's terms of service. The email asked Benn to 'fix' the app by Monday, but Benn said doing this would make the app would be pointless. 'To be honest, I wasn't nonplussed when I got the email from Facebook,' Benn told DailyMail.com. 'I knew my app was playing in a legal gray area, and I suspected Facebook would find out about it somehow.' Facebook has strict restrictions against using its private API. An engineer from Instagram allegedly sent Benn an email last week, claiming the app violated the company's terms of service. Pictured on the right is a screenshot of the 'Uploader for Instagram' service . Chris Messina, a Silicon Valley technologist told CNNMoney the problem is that accessing the API 'opens up possibilities for all kinds of abuse, from spambots or people uploading stuff from other channels.' One in five Instagram users now combine their photos into a single image before uploading it to the app. To capitalise on this, the Californian firm has launched its latest standalone app called Layout that lets people create such collages with up to nine images and 11 combinations. Photos can be selected from the phone's camera roll, or taken with the Photo Booth tool, and Layouts can then be 'remixed' and edited with mirror effects and flips. The Layout app has four main features called Faces, Mirroring, Photo Booth and Previews. Users begin by selecting as many images, up to the maximum of nine, to feature in the collage. Photos can be selected or deselected at any point. As they add more images, the layout of the collage changes and photos can be dragged between sections and different sized boxes as desired. These photos can then be zoomed, flipped to form a mirror image, or turned upside down. He added, if Instagram wanted users to post from a computer, they can do so themselves. 'I was initially inspired to create the app because I saw a sincerely lacking feature for the desktop,' Benn said. 'I know Instagram purposely left out the uploading feature from the web interface to keep the social network’s unique, mobile-centered ecosystem intact. Instagram did release a web version of its software, called 'Your Instagram Feed on the Web' in February 2013. This allowed users to comment on each other's photos from a desktop, but the photo sharing site still does not allow uploaded of images from a PC. To combat the problem, some Instagram fans have installed special software, such as BlueStacks App Player, designed to simulate a mobile phone operating system on their computer. Uploader for Instagram offers a simpler workaround, and it is already garnering positive reviews on the App store. One user wrote: 'For my job, we post eight to ten Instagram pictures a week that are first designed on the computer. 'So it's always been a bit of a nuisance to transfer the image over to my phone then upload to Instagram. This app takes care of that.' Instagram, which Facebook acquired in 2012 for $1 billion, has 300 million monthly users. A spokesperson for Instagram declined to comment to DailyMail.com about the developments. Benn told DailyMail.com: 'I’ve played a few of my last cards, and now I’m just going to wait for Facebook to play theirs. 'I have no idea how this entire ordeal is going to end, but at least I know that I helped make a handful of people’s lives easier–and I think that that is worth all of the trouble.'

"A 16-year-old boy who was seized in an anti-terror operation after he tried to buy deadly poison on the internet has been spared jail after the court heard he wanted to commit suicide. The teenager from Mossley, Greater Manchester, who cannot be named for legal reasons, ordered the deadly toxin off the 'dark web'. He was unaware his online requests were being tracked by covert counter-terrorism officers who feared he was planning an attack. The teenager pleaded guilty to trying to buy the toxin at Manchester Youth Court earlier this month. A 16-year-old boy who was seized in an anti-terror operation after he tried to buy deadly poison on the internet has been spared jail after the court heard he wanted to commit suicide . But he claimed he was attempting to buy the deadly poison because he wanted to commit suicide and was sentenced to a 12 month referral order. Officers from the North West Counter Terrorism Unit started investigating the teenager in January when they received information that he was attempting to obtain the poison. Officers were in contact with the boy over the dark web - a subsection of deep web which is not indexed by standard search engines so users are less likely to be monitored. During their covert communication he expressed an interest in buying the poison and also showed an awareness of its toxicity and potential for use in causing harm. The teenager pleaded guilty to trying to buy the toxin at Manchester Youth Court (pictured) earlier this month . The 16-year-old  attempted to place an order on February 6 and also suggested he would make future purchases in larger quantities. Officers raided two homes in Tameside on February 16 and the 16-year-old boy was arrested. A 16-year-old girl was also arrested as part of the investigation but later released without charge. The dark web is a subsection of the deep web - the part of the internet that does not show up in searches or on social media. Most of the information on the web is far down on dynamically generated sites, unable to be found or seen by traditional search engines. The dark web is used as a way of sharing information and trading goods, but the anonymous and encrypted nature of it has attracted large amounts of illegal activity. The Silk Road website, and its successor that were recently shut down, was used to sell drugs in exchange for Bitcoins. Other dark net sites let users share pornographic photographs, hacked information and credit card numbers. Det Sgt Russell Stubbs said after the case: 'The teenager at the centre of this investigation is clearly a vulnerable, troubled young man and I hope now that this case is concluded he can get the help and support he needs to turn his life around. 'Thanks to the vigilance of officers from a number of different law enforcement agencies, we were able to intervene before this young man did get hold of such a deadly substance from a genuine seller. 'I want to reassure our communities that the North West Counter Terrorism Unit and local police are well aware of the potential dangers associated with internet activity on the 'dark web'. Law enforcement agencies use a range of investigative techniques to monitor and police unlawful internet activity. 'I would also urge parents of children to keep a very close eye on what their children are doing. Security measures are available to block certain sites and if you suspect your child is spending too much time on the Internet and you notice sudden changes in their behaviour then please report it. 'As in this case, the sooner we are able to identify someone either at risk or using the 'dark web' for criminal purposes the better chance we have to consider appropriate intervention options.' Last year, a graphic designer who fantasised about poisoning her mother after she forbade her from marrying the man became the first person to be prosecuted under the Biological Weapons Act. Kuntal Patel, from Stratford, east London, had wished her 'selfish and controlling' mother Meena Patel dead after the 61-year-old was 'hell-bent' on breaking up her engagement, a court was told. During the trial at Southwark Crown Court, the court heard the 37-year-old contacted a dealer in the U.S through the 'dark web' and said she needed a 'tasteless' and deadly toxin to get her mother 'out of the way'.

"(CNN)A mammoth wave of snow darkens the sky over Everest Base Camp. Appearing like a white mushroom cloud roaring over the climbers, they scurry as their tents flap like feathers in the wind. Then panic hits. ""Whoa! Whoa!"" Screams and expletives are heard. The few people in the video scatter and dive into a tent as the deluge of snow falls over them. Cursing and breathing heavily, they wait until the pounding is over. After a while, they scream to each other, ""Are you all right?"" ""Are you OK?"" The camera jostles back and forth as German climber Jost Kobusch heaves to catch his breath. Nearly 4,000 dead in Nepal earthquake . When they finally emerge from their avalanche ordeal, their faces are scarlet and their bodies crusted in snow. They trudge away, completely dazed and shocked. ""The ground was shaking from the earthquake and as soon as we saw people running, we were running ourselves to save our lives,"" Kobusch wrote in a post on his YouTube video. The harrowing two-minute clip shows the unimaginable scale of the avalanche that smashed into Everest Base Camp on Saturday. At least 17 people have been killed, with dozens injured and several missing -- likely buried beneath the snow and ice. The fates of the climbers and the local hires are one part of the enormous human toll in Nepal from the catastrophic quake that has so far claimed the lives of more than 4,300 people. At least 8,000 people were reported to have suffered injuries. Helicopters brought stranded climbers off the mountain Monday amid growing concern for the groups stuck around 20,000 feet (6,100 meters) high in Camps 1 and 2. The climbers who were higher up Everest appeared to have avoided the deadly avalanche that struck Base Camp, but many -- estimated to be in the hundreds -- could not descend on their own. The climbers can't head down because the dangerous Khumbu Icefall has been ravaged by a series of aftershocks. The aftershocks sent snow and rocks thundering down the mountainside, complicating rescue efforts. Tshering Sherpa, who manages the icefall route, estimated that 100 to 200 people were stuck in the higher camps after the avalanche. ""Bottom line, the icefall has been deemed impassable at this point,"" said Alan Arnette, a climber and Everest blogger who was at Camp 2 when the avalanche struck. He said that climbers at Camp 2 and others higher up would descend to Camp 1 (elevation 19,500 feet) to await helicopters. Arnette was helicoptered down to Base Camp on Monday. Witnesses said three helicopters rescued climbers and Sherpas from Camp 1, taking two people down at a time. Carsten Pedersen, a Danish climber at Base Camp, said that he heard a steady stream of helicopters ferrying people from the mountains back to Base Camp throughout the morning. ""They land every 10 minutes here,"" Pedersen said. ""I estimate half the people have been rescued, and it's probably less than 200 people in the mountain this morning. I wouldn't be surprised if 100 people came down already."" The window for helicopter rescue was expected to be between 9 a.m. and noon Monday. The helicopter rescues are heavily contingent on the weather. Jim Davidson, a climber on Everest, tweeted that the evacuations were going well. Down at Base Camp, Jamlins Sherpa said he counted about 22 body bags that were to be transported back to their families in Kathmandu. The death toll on Everest is still unclear. In an audio blog recorded from Camp 2, Arnette signed off with this message: ""It's important, it's not about mountaineering. This is about the earth and it's a horrible loss of life at Everest Base Camp and down at Kathmandu. ""It's a massive loss of life."" A member of Arnette's team, Eve Girawong, a medic from New Jersey who worked on the mountain, was killed at Base Camp, according to her family and employer. Several Everest climbing teams have confirmed deaths. Five Nepali staff members were killed at Everest Base Camp and Camp 1, according to Adventure Consultants. It did not identify the staffers. Three Sherpas from the 360 Expeditions team died, the company posted on its Facebook page. Their names were also not revealed. The foreign casualties at Everest Base Camp include Dan Fredinburg, an American executive at Google who died after suffering a major head injury, and Tom Taplin, a documentary filmmaker from California. ""He was blown away by the blast rather than being buried in any rubble,"" Taplin's wife, Corey Freyer, told CNN affiliate KABC. The exact number of dead remains unclear. CNN's Jessica King, Jethro Mullen, journalists Wayne Chang and Naomi Ng contributed to this report.","A YouTube video shows the scale of an avalanche on Mount Everest on Saturday .

"Turkey has blocked access to Twitter and YouTube after they refused a request to remove pictures of a prosecutor held during an armed siege last week. A Turkish court imposed the blocks because images of the deadly siege were being shared on social media and 'deeply upset' the wife and children of Mehmet Selim Kiraz, the hostage who was killed. The 46-year-old Turkish prosecutor died in hospital when members of the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front (DHKP-C) stormed a courthouse and took him hostage. The DHKP-C is considered a terrorist group by Turkey, the European Union and US. Scroll down for video .

He died in hospital after he was taken hostage by the far-left organisation . Two of his captors were killed when security forces took back the building where the far-left group was holding him. Gunshots were heard and smoke could be seen rising from the scene at the end of the six-hour stand-off. Mr Kiraz, a father-of-two married to a judge who also worked at the courthouse, was targeted for his part in an investigation into the death of Berkin Elvan. The 15-year-old was severely wounded after being hit on the head by a tear-gas canister fired by a police officer during anti-government protests in Istanbul in June 2013. After spending 269 days in a coma, Elvan eventually died on March 11 last year. His death, and the subsequent investigation, have since become a rallying point for the country's far-left.

A Foreign Office spokeswoman said this morning: 'I can confirm that a British national has been arrested in Turkey and that we are offering consular assistance.' Before imposing the blocks on the websites, Turkish authorities had tried to prevent newspapers printing images taken during the siege last week. The newspapers were accused by the government of 'spreading terrorist propaganda' in sharing the images of the hostage-taking. Presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said: 'This has to do with the publishing of the prosecutor's . picture. What happened in the aftermath (of the prosecutor's . killing) is as grim as the incident itself.

"The girlfriend of a teenager with a life-threatening tumour has spoken of how his condition has left him paralysed and unable to dress himself. Jahnae Jackson has put her psychology studies on hold in order to care for her long-term boyfriend, Jackson Byrnes after he was diagnosed with a stage four brain tumour four weeks ago. The 18-year-olds from northern NSW have raised over $80,000 from community generosity for his life-saving surgery to be performed on Wednesday by renowned neurosurgeon Dr. Charlie Teo. 'He's already paralysed and I have to help him do many things, including dress him' Jahnae told Daily Mail Australia. Jackson's girlfriend Jahnae Jackson (right) noticed he had developed a lump three weeks ago and prompted him to visit a doctor who requested an MRI . For the past week Jackson and girlfriend have been desperately raising the sum needed to pay the hospital . Jahnae knew they needed a second opinion, so she hunted online for specialist who was willing . Three weeks ago Jackson was told by doctors that the tumour was too deep and aggressive to be safely operated on. Jahnae knew they needed a second opinion, so she hunted online for a specialist who was willing to perform Jackson's urgent surgery and that's when she found Dr. Charlie Teo from The Prince of Wales Hospital in Sydney. 'I had to be positive for Jackson as I knew there was always a way to help,' she said. On Monday morning they reached the target on their GoFundMe page, and although they still need an additional $45,000 to cover chemotherapy and other hospital fees, they are overwhelmed by the community support from the small town of Casino in northern NSW. 'It's absolutely unbelievable that a small town can do so much,' Jahnae said. 'It makes us feel so much better.' Although Jackson's surgery is likely to save his life, he still has a long road of rehabilitation in front of him as he will be left paralysed for some time. 'I was devastated when I found out, but I couldn't really react,' she said. The 18-year-old completed school at the end of last year and admits she wanted to go to university to study psychology or social work but has put it off due to Jackson's condition. 'I'd rather help my boyfriend out and worry about university later,' she said. Although Jackson's surgery is likely to save his life, he still has a long road of rehabilitation in front of him as he will be left paralysed for some time. Jackson said he has no nerves for the operation and instead wants to get it over and done with . After desperately fundraising for a week and finally reaching his goal, Jackson said he has no nerves for the operation. 'I just want to get in there and get it over and done with,' Jackson told Daily Mail Australia. 'I'm just really thankful to the community as I didn't think we would raise this much money, it all happened so quickly.' Dr Teo, director of Sydney's Centre for Minimally Invasive Neurosurgery, said other surgeons were technically able to perform the surgery but he was the only one prepared to do it. 'People think that it's futile because he's got a malignant tumour and it's very aggressive,' Dr Teo told Daily Mail Australia. 'There's significant weakness down his left side and they think his quality of life is such that he wouldn't want to live anyway.' But Dr Teo said he makes decisions based on what his patients want. For the past week Jackson's family and friends have been desperately trying to raise $80,000 needed to pay the hospital upfront for the risky surgery . Jackson Byrnes was diagnosed with a stage four tumour three weeks ago and needed $80,000 for surgery . Jackson's mother Rhonda Byrnes said she was overwhelmed by the support and money raised by the community on his GoFundMe page, but said the family still needed more . 'If a patient really wants it and knows the risks and understands how risky the operation is I'll usually respect the patient's wishes,' he said . 'He is a lovely boy and he's only young. 'I said ""You know you're going to be paralysed"", I've told him the worst case scenario. 'He understands that and he wants to live.' Dr Teo will try to remove 95 per cent of the tumour, which has extended to very sensitive part of the brain. Dr Teo said the $80,000 payment required for the surgery was standard. Renowned neurosurgeon Dr Charlie Teo is the only surgeon in Australia willing to perform the risky operation that will likely see Jackson paralysed . Jahnae is currently in Sydney with Jackson and his family, preparing for his surgery on Wednesday . 'Most boys his age begin their journey into adulthood with hopes , dreams and anticipation of what lies ahead and excitement of the endless opportunities of what life will bring them,' Mr Byrne's fundraising page on GoFundMe reads. 'It is not a time to be enduring a fight for your life.' Victorian finance, leasing and risk management company Morris Finance have made the largest donation to the cause by pledging $2000. Jahnae is currently in Sydney with Jackson and his family, preparing for his surgery on Wednesday. 'He needs to get some scans on Tuesday and then they will schedule his surgery for the next day,' she said.

"The Revered Al Sharpton appeared on Sunday in North Charleston and is expected to attend a vigil for Walter Scott, the black driver who was fatally shot by a white police officer after he fled a traffic stop. Rev. Sharpton preached at the Charity Missionary Baptist Church and addressed the Scott case and the need for reform around national policing legislation during his sermon. Elected officials and police from North Charleston were in attendance and South Carolina Senator Marlon Kimpson was also there to hear Sharpton speak. Scroll down for video . The Revered Al Sharpton delivered a sermon and addressed the Walter Scott situation on Sunday morning . North Charleston Mayor Keith Summey (left), Police Chief Eddie Driggers (center) and Sharpton 'discussed the Scott shooting' on Sunday before the reverend spoke at Charity Missionary Baptist Church in South Carolina . Sharpton wrote on Facebook: 'Joining us this morning is Mayor Keith Summey, Sheriff Al Cannon, Senator Marlon Kimpson, SCLC Leader Michael Steele, North Charleston Police [Chief] Eddie Driggers, and Assistant Police Chief Reggie Burgess.' The officers and elected officials listened 'intently' to what Sharpton had to say as he gave credit to Mayor Summey for firing Michael Slager, the officer who killed Scott, according to the Post and Courier. During the sermon, Sharpton said: 'When he's wrong ... we protest. 'When he's right, we should have the same courage to say he's right. 'Let us use this hour to not only change what's going on in North Charleston. 'North Charleston, that's known as a place of intolerance, can be the place that could set a new tone in policing all over the United States. 'Maybe now between a southern white mayor and a forgiving black mother, maybe this nation will deal with this.' The civil rights leader is also expected to attend a vigil near the scene of the Scott shooting on Sunday afternoon. Sharpton denied Scott's family barred him from attending his funeral on Saturday because it would cause a 'circus' of media attention. Allegations that Scott's family wanted nothing to do with Sharpton were published by the New York Daily News. In response, Sharpton said: 'There has never been a discussion about me attending or participating in the funeral on Saturday, since everyone knows that [National Action Network's] convention with thousands of delegates is happening in New York and doesn't end until Saturday night.' Scott's casket was wrapped in an American flag at a funeral home in Summerville, South Carolina, on Saturday . Scott (left) was killed by Michael Slage (right).

Judy Scott wipes her eyes as she looks at her son's casket during his burial service in Summerville yesterday . Hundreds of mourners attended the funeral for Scott, 50, on Saturday in Summerville, north of North Charleston where the shooting took place. Sharpton remained in New York where his National Action Network was wrapping up its national convention. Slager, 33, the North Charleston officer who fired eight times at Scott's back as he fled from a traffic stop, has been charged with murder and dismissed from the police force. Slager pulled Scott's black Mercedes-Benz over for a broken tail light. Video from the dashboard camera in Slager's police cruiser recorded a respectful exchange between the two men before the officer returned to his patrol car. A few minutes later, after being told by Slager to stay in the Mercedes, the man emerged from his car and ran off. Scott, who was apparently unarmed, had a history of arrests for failing to pay child support. A cellphone video taken by a bystander showed the men in a brief tussle before Scott ran off again, Slager fired his gun and Scott slumped into the grass. There was a gap between the two videos, however, as the officer was not wearing a body camera. Scott's shooting was one of the latest in a series of killings that have stoked a national outcry over police use of force against African Americans. Last year, the fatal shooting of an unarmed black man in Ferguson, Missouri, and choking death of a black man in New York City triggered a wave of demonstrations across the country.","Reverend Sharpton was expected to appear Sunday in North Charleston .

"West Brom manager Tony Pulis will receive a hero's welcome when he returns to Crystal Palace on Saturday but in the midst of yet another relegation battle for the 57-year-old, he must wonder if he'll ever be successful at the right end of the Premier League. For all the expertise Pulis has in keeping clubs in the top flight, a talent that has the everlasting gratitude of Stoke City and Palace supporters, his overall record is one of the worst of any long-serving Premier League manager. This is his seventh season in the top flight and he's never finished in the top half of the table. If, as expected, Garry Monk's Swansea City don't drop lower than 10th, Pulis will be the only manager in the Premier League with more than 12 months experience who has never finished higher than 11th. Tony Pulis has never managed to guide a team into the top half of the Premier League . To add to his frustration as he takes the applause of the Palace fans who remember him for masterminding their great escape last season, Pulis will know he isn't yet guaranteed preserving his proud record of never being relegated. West Brom's home defeats against QPR and Leicester City have left them stuck on 33 points. That is still seven points above the bottom three but with four of their final five fixtures after the weekend coming against Liverpool, Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal, there is not much wriggle-room. For many, producing statistics to suggest Pulis could have produced better results is heresy. He won promotion with Stoke City and got them to an FA Cup final. He turned Palace's season around 12 months ago and is still favoured to keep Albion up this time. Pulis did an excellent job in turning around Palace's fortunes last season . Palace fans were pleased with the job Pulis did in his time at Selhurst Park . He is known as a good organiser, a smart tactician and someone who is able to get the best out of players and bend the laws of the game to his advantage. And yet, why has he never finished higher than 11th, achieved in 2009/10 with Stoke and 20013/14 with Palace? It is right to say he has never had the best clubs with the most money to manage and yet Sam Allardyce finished sixth with Bolton, Mark Hughes sixth with Blackburn Rovers, Mauricio Pochettino eighth with Southampton and Monk is currently eighth with Swansea City. None of them giants of the game. Pulis took Stoke into the Premier League and turned them into an established team . Pardew, who has achieved a similar miracle at Palace this season to what Pulis achieved last season, has a top-five finish at Newcastle United on his cv. Two years ago, Stoke City effectively sacked Pulis, acknowledging the huge contribution he made to the club but feeling he couldn't take them any further. Hughes now has the club sitting in 10th place, higher than Pulis achieved, and on a smaller wages budget. Alan Pardew could guide Crystal Palace into the top half of the table just as Mark Hughes could do at Stoke  - something Pulis never achieved . Pulis will remain plain-speaking til the end. The Welshman won't be able to enjoy his visit to Palace given the importance of the game. 'We need a 90 minutes from the players. I don't care what anyone says, everyone has a go in this division and the lads have to understand that. 'What we have to do is get back to basics and defend properly. Lower league mistakes cost you goals.' You'd back Pulis' message to keep West Brom up. Whether he can take them to a higher level next season is another question.

"Tony Pulis believes Joey Barton 'probably had a point' when claiming West Bromwich Albion's players 's*** themselves' during defeat to Queens Park Rangers earlier this season. In December West Brom were two goals up but lost to a Charlie Austin hat-trick, leading to Barton's scathing judgement and plunging Alan Irvine to the brink of the sack. Barton said then: 'West Brom went 2-0 up and I turned to Dunney (Richard Dunne) and said, 'they've scored too early.' They don't know how to get over the finishing line.'

The teams meet again at the Hawthorns on Saturday with Pulis having instilled a solid core to the point Albion have not conceded after scoring first in a game. 'Whatever Joey says or whatever he does he's entitled to hid views and his opinions,' Pulis said. 'The club were 2-0 up and lost 3-2 so he most probably had a point, or he felt he had a point to say something on that subject.' Pulis recalled his own misfortune from leading 2-0 and losing as Gillingham manager in the Second Division play-off final of 1999. 'I've managed teams that have been 2-0 up with only for or five minutes to go and ended up drawing then losing on penalties. 1999 Man City Wembley,' he added. 'So I can't talk about being indestructible in respect to leads. 'We've played really well I don't think they've just been good results. The performances have been really, really good.

"Ed Miliband (pictured yesterday at the Shree Swaminarayan Temple, north London) is pressing on with his controversial cap rents, despite warnings from experts that plans will backfire . Labour's plans to impose rent controls are ‘economically illiterate’ and will slash investment in new housing, leading to more tenants being evicted by their landlords, experts warned last night. Ed Miliband yesterday confirmed he would press on with controversial plans to cap rents despite warnings from housing experts, business and even Labour figures that they will backfire. He said rent controls – demanded by the militant Unite union that bankrolls Labour – would give millions of ‘forgotten’ renters a fairer deal by helping those stuck in so-called Generation Rent by soaring house prices. But the Generation Rent campaign group said his plans were ‘riddled with loopholes’ and may make tenants’ lives worse. Under the proposals, landlords would have to offer three-year tenancies and would be banned from raising rent above inflation during this time. Alex Hilton, director of Generation Rent, said long tenancies were welcome but the proposal would give landlords an incentive to evict their tenants and would not keep rent down, adding: ‘This is because they have no plans to limit rent rises between tenancies – or after your first three years are up. ‘Worse than this, Labour’s planning new ways for landlords to evict you within that period, for example to sell your home or get it back for other reasons. These loopholes are scary when you think they’re attached to a big financial incentive to use them – because that’s the only way they will be able to put rent up in the first three years.’ In another loophole, hundreds of thousands of properties owned by buy-to-let investors could be excluded altogether. Most buy-to-let mortgages specify maximum tenancies of one year. Labour sources said these landlords would be able to offer short tenancies ‘where contractually obliged’. Senior Tories called the proposal ‘drivel’ and said it would suppress house building and push rents up. Chancellor George Osborne described the plan as a ‘totally economically-illiterate statement that grabs headlines, but is dismissed by every expert who looks at it’. The Confederation of British Industry said the way to tackle the housing crisis was to build more homes, and warned the plans could discourage investment, thereby forcing up rents in the long term. The Labour leader said rent controls – demanded by the militant Unite union that bankrolls Labour – would give millions of ‘forgotten’ renters a fairer deal by helping those stuck in so-called Generation Rent . Senior Tories called the proposal ‘drivel’ and said it would suppress house building and push rents up. Pictured: Mr Miliband and Boris Johnson on the Andrew Marr show today . Some senior Labour figures also have concerns, with former minister Tessa Jowell warning against a cap last week, saying: ‘Before taking a step like that you have to be clear it doesn’t have unintended consequences.’ Yesterday, however, she insisted she supported the plan. Housing spokesman Emma Reynolds was forced on the back foot yesterday after footage emerged of her in 2013 saying: ‘I don’t think rent controls are going to work in practice.’ Yesterday, she said she meant ‘Seventies-style controls’ and said Labour’s plan was different. Rent controls were widely blamed for a reduction in rented housing in Britain and Europe in the Seventies as investment dried up. The bad old days: A Manchester slum . Rent controls have already proved a disaster in Britain after they were introduced in the First World War. The measure was supposed to be temporary – but was only dismantled by Margaret Thatcher in the Eighties. During this time the private rented sector collapsed from 90 per cent of the country’s housing stock to less than 10 per cent. By the Seventies, rent controls were widely blamed for the slum conditions in much of Britain’s remaining private rented stock. Landlords, unable to make a sustainable return, neglected homes and dragged their feet over the most basic repairs. Unscrupulous operators such as Peter Rachman, whose name became a byword for exploitation, drove out tenants who had legal rent protection to replace them with others who were not covered by the law. Gordon Brown’s favourite economist Paul Krugman, a Nobel prize-winner, has warned that attempts to control rent always fail, writing: ‘Almost every freshman-level textbook contains a case study on rent control, using its known adverse side-effects to illustrate the principles of supply and demand.’ The socialist Swedish economist Assar Lindbeck once said: ‘Next to bombing, rent control seems in many cases to be the most efficient technique for destroying cities.’ Alan Ward, of the Residential Landlords Association, warned that rent controls could result in a return to the ugly conditions of the past, adding they ‘would lessen investment in new homes when we need more and serve only to paper over cracks in the market’. He said: ‘For some, it is easier to achieve a cheap political point by calling for rent controls than provide a prescription for growth in the private rented sector. Ultimately, tenants would lose as they find themselves forced into slums rented by Rachman landlords operating outside the legal market.’ David Cox, of the Association of Residential Letting Agents, said rent controls led to a fall in supply and the standard of homes because ‘landlords do not have the money to invest in ongoing maintenance’. Sam Bowman, of the Adam Smith Institute think-tank, said rent controls were ‘a stunningly bad idea that could clobber renters’. He said they would give landlords a huge incentive to raise rents at the start of a tenancy, adding: ‘Labour has unwittingly announced a policy that could devastate cities and exacerbate the housing crisis.’ The Institute of Economic Affairs said the proposal ‘would result in higher rents, a reduction in the quality of rented property and in the supply of homes to rent without improving affordability’.

"Police have dropped an investigation into a vicious assault on a huntsman just three months after it took place – despite a wealth of evidence pointing to the identity of a suspected attacker. Last night the victim, Mike Lane, 40, who was beaten by balaclava-clad protesters armed with iron bars on ropes, condemned the decision by police as ‘pathetic’. He said: ‘They could have made more effort. Everyone is very disappointed. I’ve been told that unless further evidence comes forward, the attackers are not likely to be found. We find it pathetic.’ Attack: Mike Lane,40, who is joint master of the Tedworth Hunt,  on the ground during the confrontation with hunt saboteurs . A video of the incident and a dossier of evidence, including some names of saboteurs and their car registration numbers, was given to Wiltshire Police after the assault. The attack at Everleigh, near Amesbury, took place even though the 30 riders and their hounds were chasing only an artificial scent, rather than a fox. During the incident, Mr Lane, who is joint master of the Tedworth Hunt, was sent flying to the ground, before being kicked in the head. He was admitted to hospital with concussion and broken teeth and his face was swollen. Since the attack he has suffered memory loss. The face of the thug who kicked Mr Lane was captured on video. Following the attack, Wiltshire Police issued the suspect’s photograph, although he has not been identified. In an exclusive interview with The Mail on Sunday, Mr Lane said: ‘I’ve been told by police they are shelving their inquiries due to insufficient evidence. It’s angered us because we gave them evidence. I’m beginning to lose my trust in the police.’ Wiltshire Police confirmed they had stopped the investigation pending further information, but their failure to identify, charge or prosecute anyone involved has dismayed hunt supporters across the country. This is the face of the main suspect . On the day of the attack, January 24, about 15 protesters sprayed hounds with the perfumed chemical citronella to distract them from the scent. Mr Lane said: ‘I noticed they parked about 250 yards away. Then five came towards us. They were looking for trouble – it was a hardcore element we’d not seen before. ‘They were abusive and then one spat at me and then punched me in the face. A scuffle broke out and I slipped and one started kicking me in the head, stamped on me and the heel of his steel toe-capped trainer stuck in my mouth. I was knocked out for a few minutes. Then the chap started swinging a rope with an iron bar.’ Mr Lane, who has paid £500 for dental treatment since the attack, added: ‘I feel let down and think the police could have done more.’ Karen Fieldsend, 42, who made the call to police, is furious that the case has been dropped. ‘It’s disgraceful,’ she said. ‘If you had people assaulted in a city centre, something would be done, but in the countryside people forget about it.’ James Cameron, 53, vice-chairman of the Tedworth Hunt, added: ‘Their decision is disappointing, but this highlights how difficult it is for police to do their job when saboteurs turn up wearing face coverings.’ The Countryside Alliance is campaigning to ban saboteurs from wearing a face covering so criminals can be brought to justice. Last night a spokesman for Wiltshire Police said: ‘We have been unable to move the inquiry further forward. At this stage the case has been recorded as undetected, however should other evidence come to light then it will be re-opened.’","Mike Lane was beaten by masked protesters armed with iron bars on ropes .

"Juventus have ruled out a move for Manchester United loan star Radamel Falcao after claiming the Colombia striker's wages are 'beyond their means'. Falcao has endured a difficult period at Old Trafford after arriving in an expensive loan deal from Monaco last summer. The 29-year-old is unlikely to remain at the club after scoring only four goals and failing to force his way into Louis van Gaal's starting XI. Juventus general manager Beppe Marotta has claimed that Falcao wanted to come to Turin last summer but the Serie A champions have now taken themselves out of the race to sign him. Radamel Falcao (right) has scored only four goals since arriving at Manchester United from Monaco . The Colombian is expected to leave in the summer, although Juventus claim they cannot afford him . 'Falcao is a Monaco player on loan at Manchester United and his wages are substantial and beyond our means,' Marotta told La Gazzetta dello Sport. 'It's utopian to imagine him in a Juventus shirt.' However, Marotta did claim the Italians, who reached the Champions League semi-finals at the expense of Monaco on Wednesday, were interested in strike pair Paulo Dybala and Edinson Cavani. With former Manchester City striker Carlos Tevez set to return to Boca Juniors at the end of the season, Juventus need to reinforce their forward line with Palermo's Dybala and Edinson of Paris Saint Germain at the top of their wishlist. The Serie A champions have expressed an interest in highly rated Palermo youngster Paulo Dybala . With Dybala rated at £35m, PSG's unsettled striker Edinson Cavani could be a cheaper alternative . 'We do like Dybala and he is one of our objectives,' Marotta said. 'I won't hide the fact that I have met with [Palermo president Maurizio] Zamparini -- even if I do go and deny it, he will only blurt it out anyway. 'He's a great player, but alongside him you need experienced players too. We're trying to find an agreement with Zamparini for this player who we like, but we're not the only ones who like him. Let's just see what happens.' Juventus players celebrate after beating Monaco to reach the Champions League semi-finals . The 21-year-old, who has scored 13 goals this term, is rated at £35million by his club - a fee that the Old Lady would not be prepared to meet, leading Marotta to also express his interest in Uruguay forward Cavani. 'We've not had any contact with Paris Saint-Germain for Cavani, but if he were to be placed on the market, then we would have a little chat,' Marotta said.","Monaco loanee Radamel Falcao is not expected to stay at Man Utd .

"The father of the little girl who starred in a photograph that sent the internet into a frenzy because of a mystery pair of boots has 'no idea' what the object could be. Martin Springall, 38, photographed his young daughter - who he wished not be named - standing near a rocky outcrop in Zushi, Japan, in July 2014. He said he was living and working in Tokyo, around an hour north, and wanted to send a picture 'to my wife, who was at work'. 'I took a series of them,' Mr Springall said via email. 'It wasn't until I was checking them later in the evening that I just happened to notice the boots behind her in that one shot.' 'I showed my wife immediately. She was considerably more upset by it than I was, to be honest. Martin Springall (pictured with his daughter, who he wished not to be named) said he had 'no idea' what the item could be . A trick of the light or paranormal forces at play? There is chatter online about what the cause of this apparent black boot apparition is .

The Reddit user who posted the controversial image online suggested they could be samurai boots - although others are not so sure . Mr Springall gave permission for his friend, Brian, to post the image to Reddit - where it became a topic of 'mostly negative' discussion - until it resurfaced this week . 'I just kind of obsessed over that one photo for a couple of hours that evening and then tried to forget about it. 'I really don't like dwelling on stuff like this, to be honest - it freaks me out.' The photograph has sparked considerable debate on the website Reddit, with sceptics arguing whether the picture was modified, if there was a person standing behind the girl or if it was all a trick of the light. Mr Springall insisted there was 'no one' else in the vicinity - and said it had not been Photoshopped, despite sceptics believing otherwise. 'I certainly would have noticed someone standing behind her in one of the shots,' he said. 'She likely wouldn't even have posed for the picture in that case, because she's incredibly shy'. In this picture from the same set, no one appears to be standing behind this little girl . However, in this other supplied picture, the black boots have returned . 'I have no idea what the boots are, where they come from or what they could represent. 'All I can tell you is that I totally get the cynicism.... If I saw that online I would view it exactly the same way. 'I can assure you, though, that it was just the two of us in the area and the photo is 100% untouched.

Friends: Brian (left) posted the picture to Reddit, where it took off. Both Martin and Brian . Sceptics have noted the presence of a blue piece of fabric lingering behind the little girl . He added that he had just been 'speculating' previously when he said on Reddit that the boots appeared to be 'samurai boots'. He said there were more convincing posts on Reddit that argued it was actually the image of an American World War II era uniform. Particularly given a flash of blue fabric that appeared above her left arm. 'I hope someone can put this through some sort of image-analysis software,' he said. 'We aren't trying to pull some sort of scam here. We're just saying ""we can't explain this, and it's a bit unsettling"".'

Pitched to take on the pumpedup Nissan Juke, the Tivoli SUV is powered by 1.6 litre Euro 6 petrol and diesel engines with six speed manual and automatic transmissions. It arrives in the UK this summer in three trim levels - SE, EX, ELX - with a choice of front-wheel drive or 'intelligent' 4x4 and seven airbags across the range. There's also a five-year unlimited mileage warranty. The entry level SE, from £12,950, is finished in grey cloth trim and includes 16-in alloys, cruise control, a petrol stop/go system, seven airbags and 'smart' steering with normal, comfort and sport modes. The top-of-the-range ELX, from £16,000 to £19,000, comes fully loaded with a choice of the full range of engines and gearboxes plus diamond cut alloy wheels, smart keyless starting, front and rear parking sensors, privacy glass, rear spoiler, automatic headlamps, rain sensing wipers, TomTom navigation system with 7 in touch screen and a rear-view camera. There is a choice of six exterior colours, and even a 'My Tivoli' personalisation programme which allows customers to create their own distinctive car. This includes the styling pack (£400) which gives a choice of five two-tone roof combinations, plus further engine and drivetrain options. As well as offering lots of interior seating and storage space, it aims to offer driver and passengers easy connectivity to their IT devices. SssangYong's UK sales and marketing director Steve Gray expects it to double the firm's annual UK sales from 2,000 to 4,000 a year. UK chief executive Paul Williams says: 'This is a car that will really put SsangYong on the map and change perceptions.' Citroen's Aircross model (above) has protective alloy bumps front and side . Motorists of a certain age may recall those fondly remembered TV adverts from childhood for rufty-tufty Tonka Toys. These were virtually indestructible metal cars - usually 4x4s or trucks with massive wheels. The TV advert informed viewers: 'They build real tough toys, for real tough boys - Tonka!' Well, Citroen seems to have taken its inspiration from them for its Aircross model (above). It even has protective alloy bumps front and side made from honeycomb aluminium castings surrounded by hard rubber. Billed as a big brother to the current Citroen C4 Cactus, it was shown in prototype hybrid form at the Shanghai Motor Show in China. Citroen's global boss, Briton Linda Jackson, says her company has to regain the sort of design flair that created the 2CV: 'If we want stand-out cars, then we have to be bold.' The prototype has a 1.6 litre petrol engine linked to an electric motor combining to create 313bhp. Citroen claims a special boost function will help it accelerate from rest to 62mph in 4.5 seconds. Don't hold your breath. But many do see it as France's answer to Britain's new Land Rover Discovery Sport. Ii is almost time for the next Goodwood Festival of Speed. Tickets have now gone on sale for the event which runs from June 25 to 28. The theme of 'Flat-Out and Fearless: Racing on the Edge' pays tribute to the drivers and constructors throughout history who 'threw caution to the wind in pursuit of victory'. Goodwood favourites: JackieStewart and his wife Helen . The festival, billed as 'the world's largest automotive garden party' is held in the grounds of Lord March's Goodwood House and estate near Chichester, West Sussex. It attracts the A-list of the world motor manufacturing chiefs, motor sport legends - from Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton to Sir Stirling Moss and Sir Jackie Stewart - as well as showbiz celebrities in a way the original British Motor Show never could. More than 600 cars and motorcycles spanning the phenomenal history of motoring and motor sport take part alongside a 'Moving Motor Show' presented by the AA. The traditional central feature - a vast automotive-themed sculpture - will this year honour Japanese car giant Mazda's contribution to motoring and motor sport in the year that the latest incarnation of its best-selling MX-5 sports car is launched. Details and tickets: goodwood.com. Race and road car designer Professor Gordon Murray - who produced the legendary McLaren F1 supercar - is to collaborate with engine specialist Osamu Goto to create an ultracompact fuel-efficient vehicle for city use. But it has to run on conventional fuels such as petrol. The car, being sponsored by Shell under the code-name 'Project M' is to be unveiled in November.","SsangYong (Korean for 'two dragons') is launching a  sports utility vehicle .

"Lorenzo Simon was today found guilty of murder after killing his tenant then hacking his body into pieces . A landlord who chopped his friend up and stuffed the body parts into suitcases which he dumped in a canal was today found guilty of murder. Lorenzo Simon, 34, forced victim Michael Spalding, 39, to decorate his flat before attacking him when he refused to work any longer. He then dismembered the handyman using a hacksaw and put Mr Spalding's body parts and tools into two suitcases. Simon, with the help of his girlfriend Michelle Bird, 35, then threw the suitcases into a canal which they weighed down using broken concrete slabs. Today he was found guilty of murder after a jury took 15 hours to decide by unanimous verdict at Birmingham Crown Court. Bird was cleared of murder and manslaughter but admitted assisting an offender following the four-week trial. The court heard Simon murdered Mr Spalding, known as Spud, by stabbing him in the neck at the flat they shared in Smethwick, Birmingham, on April 26 last year. He then hacked the body up and stuffed the head, limbs and tools into a suitcase. Police found his remains when a narrow boat owner spotted one suitcase, containing Mr Spalding's torso, floating in the Birmingham Canal on May 5. It was examined by a Canal Trust contractor on May 12, who opened the case to discover the gruesome evidence. Police divers recovered the second case which contained Mr Spalding's head, limbs and tools - below Pope Bridge, Smethwick, on May 16. Further searches of the canal bed uncovered a hacksaw which was used to saw off Mr Spalding's head. Using futuristic 3D scanning technology experts were able to show a perfect jigsaw fit between the charred bone and a severed limb found in the suitcase. The same technique - which provides image resolution 43,000 times more detailed that a hospital CT scan - proved a link between the hacksaw and lacerations found on other bones. Mr Spalding's body parts were found inside this suitcase, which was dumped in the Birmingham Canal . A second suitcase (pictured) containing Mr Spalding's grisly remains was discovered 11 days later . Drag marks were also found on the towpath near Pope's Bridge where Simon and Bird dumped the suitcases into the canal. Unemployed Simon, who has convictions for robbery, burglary, theft and supplying drugs, moved to Derby in a bid to evade police but was arrested with Bird on May 19. He denied knowledge of Mr Spalding's death, claiming he threw him out following a row over a car crash, but later admitted assaulting him during a fight. Neighbours reported seeing a bonfire in the garden and when officers raided the home they discovered part of a humerus bone inside the drum. Detectives later heard accounts from neighbours who told of 'aggressive, nasty' arguments coming from the flat. One recalled Simon saying: 'I want this place finished, I've got to live here, you are taking the p**s'. 3D scanning technology was able to prove a link between this hacksaw and lacerations found on Mr Spalding's bones . Mr Spalding was heard to reply: 'I'm tired, I'm hungry, I want to go home. I've been at it all day'. Adjourning the case until next Wednesday for sentencing, Justice Kathryn Thirlwall said: 'Lorenzo Simon you have been convicted of murder. As you know the sentence for murder is life imprisonment. 'The question is the minimum amount of time you should serve before the consideration of parole.' Speaking after the verdict, Detective Inspector Harry Harrison, of West Midlands Police, said: 'Michael was exploited in life by Lorenzo Simon and Michelle Bird and they afforded him no dignity in death. When police raided the home, parts of a humerus bone were discovered inside this charred drum . 'On the contrary, they treated him in the most despicable manner in order to conceal their crime. 'Simon accepted Michael as a tenant on the agreement he used his considerable handyman skills to do up the flat. 'But he treated him like a slave, working him past midnight and then waking him early in the morning to continue working. 'They were only allowed out with his say-so and given just one meal a day, usually pizza and chips. 'Michael finally broke and complained at their treatment. We believe that, combined with a car accident where Simon accused him of being responsible for damaging his VW Passat, led to the fatal attack. 'Simon said he hit Michael in the back and that he fell to the floor dead within seconds and claimed to have disposed of the body in panic. 'Bird said she was on an errand to buy alcohol at the time of the killing but later admitted helping her boyfriend in the aftermath. 'However, we were able to provide compelling evidence to the jury that this was a vicious murder and that Simon went to considerable lengths to try and cover his tracks.'","Lorenzo Simon, 34, forced tenant Michael Spalding to decorate his flat .

"Ten people, including four children, have been involved in a multi-vehicle crash in Brisbane's west. Three vehicles collided on the Brisbane Valley Highway, 2km south of Fernvale, on Wednesday afternoon. A 40-year-old man with chest and shoulder injuries and a five-year-old boy with chest pain were the first patients flown out by rescue helicopter. They've been taken to the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Brisbane. Shortly after, a 27-year-old woman with arm injuries and a six-year-old girl suffering from abdominal pain were also being flown out. The three car pileup happened at on the Brisbane Valley Highway, near Fernvale . Six others - including an infant and two young girls - have been taken to Ipswich Hospital with minor injuries or for further assessment. A man has also suffered hand lacerations and two females escaped injuries. The affected stretch of the highway has been closed off, with diversions in place south of Fernvale. The Courier-Mail reports that earlier emergency crews found one person trapped inside their vehicle and Queensland Fire and Rescue crews used hydraulic cutting gear to free them. The Rescue 500 helicopter then landed at the scene and airlifted a number of patients to hospital. Police said the highway would be closed for a few hours with diversions in place south of Fernvale.","Three vehicles collided on the Brisbane Valley Highway, near Fernvale .

"Researchers have discovered that the brain can remember 'neutral' or boring events more easily when they are tied to an emotion . From what we eat to what we see, we constantly take in details about our environment. And while there is no need to remember many of them, our brain has the remarkable ability to store information that seems inconsequential at the time in case it becomes useful later on. Given new and relevant information, human beings have the capacity to strengthen weak memories using emotions - and researchers have said this points to the adaptive nature of human memory. Psychologists at New York University have been trying to gain an understanding about how the brain stores memories for 'emotionally neutral events' that gain significance through subsequent experience. 'How does the brain store all of this information? And how does emotion strengthen mundane memories?' post-doctoral fellows Joseph Dunsmoor and Vishnu Murty wrote on The Conversation. This study largely focused on how our brains remember emotionally arousing stimuli, such as evocative imagery or traumatic events . In particular, the study has looked into how the September 11 terrorist attacks in the the US affect memory retention. The researchers said we take for granted that we remember highly emotional events better than we remember neutral events, like a lunch date. Emotion increases our ability to remember by affecting activity in brain regions involved in emotional processing - particularly the amygdala and striatum - and also the regions involved in encoding new experiences, like the hippocampus. Scroll down for video . Emotion also increases the strength of our memory over time - a process called consolidation. Strong emotion can strengthen memory for positive events, such as a surprise birthday party thrown by close friends, and for negative events, such as making an embarrassing faux pas at the office holiday party. Researchers said we take for granted that we remember highly emotional events, like 9/11, better than we remember neutral events, like a lunch date. This is because emotion affects activity in certain brain regions. A view over the Hudson River towards the September 11th memorial lights is shown . A power nap of just 45 minutes can boost memory by five times, research has found. A short doze helps you to retain information you have learned and 'significantly' improves recall, scientists said – meaning naps really could help students revising for exams. Participants in the study learned 90 single words and 120 unconnected word pairs such as 'milk taxi'. Some then watched a DVD while others slept. When they were then retested, those who had slept remembered more word pairs, the journal Neurobiology of Learning and Memory reported last month. Scientists from Saarland University in Germany, said that during sleep, bursts of brain activity known as sleep spindles play an important role in consolidating newly learned information. Professor Axel Mecklinger said a nap of just 45 minutes to an hour 'produces a five-fold improvement in information retrieval from memory'. 'The memory performance of the participants who had a power nap was just as good as it was before sleeping, that is, immediately after completing the learning phase.' While many details are not intrinsically emotionally arousing, they can gain emotional significance through our experiences. For example, the memory of a surprise birthday party includes details like what people were wearing and who was there. On the face of it, these details are not emotionally significant but we remember them because of the context in which they were experienced. Dr Dunsmoor and Dr Murty’s research has shown that people have better memory for boring information when it’s presented in an emotional context, regardless of if it is rewarding or negative. ‘In some of our earlier studies, we found that people selectively remember neutral pictures if the pictures had been associated with an electrical shock the previous day, even when the volunteers were unaware that we would later test their memory, they wrote. ‘We have also shown that people remember neutral pictures if they are warned that if they forget them, they will receive a shock the next day. ‘Likewise, being rewarded with money for remembering certain pictures the next day can boost memory for those pictures as well.’ These experiments focus on emotional factors at the time the original memory is created and the findings show how seemingly trivial information associated with a meaningful event can be selectively preserved in memory. Emotion also increases the strength of our memory over time - a process called consolidation. Strong emotion can strengthen memory for positive events, such as a surprise birthday party (stock image), and for negative events, such as making an embarrassing faux pas at an office party . Emotion affects activity in brain regions involved in emotional processing - such as the amygdala (pictured) and regions involved in encoding new experiences, like the hippocampus (also marked) But what happens when the emotional event happens after the original memories were formed? ‘In a recent study, we found that an emotional experience can enhance memory for neutral information encountered previously,’ the researchers continued. Volunteers viewed a series of trivial pictures from two categories, either animals or tools. After a delay, volunteers were presented with a new set of animal and tool pictures – only this time, when the volunteer saw the pictures they received an electrical shock to the wrist. ‘We already knew that memory would be strengthened for the pictures paired with the electrical shock. But here we found that if we paired shocks with pictures of animals, memory was strengthened for pictures of animals volunteers saw before any shocks were delivered. ‘If we shocked volunteers when they where shown pictures of tools, memory for the earlier pictures of tools was strengthened.’ The negative experience selectively increased memory for related information that was completely trivial when it was originally experienced. We use our memory not only to remember the past, but to guide our decisions in the future. Emotion helps us remember relevant information to determine our choices, but without the ability to strengthen seemingly trivial past experiences with new important information, we might end up missing out on future rewards or repeating the same mistakes.","New York University psychologists studied how the brain stores memories .

"Hull bounced back from Thursday's derby defeat to Hull KR to snatch a surprise 28-20 victory at Langtree Park, condemning St Helens to a third straight defeat. A long-distance Jamie Shaul try was enough to seal a win that shocked the home side, who appeared to be hanging on after their Good Friday exertions. The injury-hit champions - who were in the wars again last week, losing to rivals Wigan - started with two teenage debutants in their three-quarters, and Hull sensed that there were some seams to pick at. Fetuli Talanoa (left) celebrates scoring against St Helens as Hull recorded a shock victory . Hull took an early lead after forcing a repeat set from a fumbled high kick and then another from offside on the line. That pressure finally told when Joe Westerman and Leon Pryce combined to create the space for Shaul to slip through. Jordan Rankin added the extras to make it 6-0. A Saints penalty from a high tackle put them in a good attacking spot and from there nice work from Lance Hohaia and James Roby sent the supporting Tommy Makinson skipping through. Makinson tagged on the two to level the match. And Saints were soon back for more and this time a lovely short ball from Jordan Turner sent Louie McCarthy-Scarsbrook powering over the whitewash, with Makinson adding the goal . Tom Makinson, who brought Saints level after Shaul's early try, breaks away from two tacklers . The to-and-fro nature continued and a pair of Hull penalties gave them a great position to have another crack at the line with wing Curtis Naughton just managing to get the ball down despite tackle of Bailey to cut the deficit to 12-10 on 24 minutes. Saints very nearly hit right back with fresh-legged Alex Walmsley believing he had cashed in on a Hull dropped ball with a try, only for the in-goal touch judge to rule a knock on in the build up. Saints made a tactical switch at the break, with youngster Bailey withdrawn and the backline reshuffled. Hull hit the front eight minutes into the second half when former Saint Leon Pryce made a telling intervention, attacking the line and getting the ball down despite the tackle. Rankin's goal made it 16-12 to the visitors. Saints almost hit back immediately with a great break by Roby carving open the Hull defence, but although that play was foiled on the line they were soon back for more. Joe Westerman and Mark Minichiello stop Andre Savelio as Hull recorded a vital win at St Helens . And from a penalty on 54 minutes Turner, playing against his former club, showed some determination in driving towards the posts. Makinson improved to put Saints 18-16 ahead. Saints did suffer a stroke of bad luck when Adam Swift pieced the Hull left flank and was looking dangerous but then lost the ball. Hull forced an error when Hohaia was adjudged to have knocked on a high Pryce kick. From there the visitors piled on the pressure and that finally told when a floated wide ball sent Fetuli Talanoa over on 66 minutes. Rankin missed the goal but Hull had a two-point lead and looked determined to defend it. The visitors' defence holds firm to stop Josh Jones breaking through as Jordan Rankin brings him down . A penalty from a high tackle allowed Makinson to level from 30 metres nine minutes from time, but the Saints were hanging on. After a high kick was caught and returned quickly by Swift, Saints were soon back on the front foot, but a fumble by Ashworth on the halfway line turned the ball over. Hull countered ruthlessly with Shaul showing a great turn of pace and nimble footwork to turn Makinson inside out to run in from halfway. Rankin goaled and to compound Saints' misery the restart kick went out on the full. Hull worked their way down field with Rankin slotting another penalty to make the game safe with three minutes to play.","Weakened St Helens suffer another defeat against strong Hull side .

"A gang of six men have been jailed for a total of 31 years after being convicted of a string of sexual offences against teenager girls. The offences, which ranged from inciting sexual activity with a child, to rape, happened in cars, woods or at the defendants' homes in Banbury, Oxfordshire. Oxford Crown Court heard how they lured victims to parties organised on social media and then began sexually abusing them. The men were found guilty in March and have now been handed sentences of between three and nine years in jail. Jailed: Ahmed Hassan-Sule, 21 (left) was sentenced to nine years' imprisonment. Mohamed Saleh, 22, (right) was imprisoned for four years and nine months . The girls, aged between 13 and 16, were targeted by the gang  at under-18s parties organised by Ahmed Hassan-Sule, 21, known as 'Fiddy'. One child described the parties as 'a place where girls would go and the boys would choose their targets'. The victims, who were described in court as 'emotionally immature' were abused from 2009 to 2014. Sentencing Hassan-Sule and the others in a court packed with friends and relatives of the defendants and victims yesterday, Judge Zoe Smith said: 'You put on charity events to raise money for your football club. 'This raised your profile among young people in Banbury and you saw yourself as a celebrity. 'Your friends helped put on these events and you became a sexually promiscuous group, not with your own girlfriends, but with girls who were young, vulnerable and lacking in maturity.' The judge rejected the argument put forward by the defence, who accused the girls of coming forward because 'it's better to be a victim than a slag'. Behind bars: Kagiso Manase, 26, (left) was jailed for four years and Said Saleh, 20, (right) was sentenced to four years' detention in a Young Offenders Institute . One of the victims told the Oxford Mail: 'When I used to go missing I would swear at my mum and I didn't realise I was being really nasty to her. The men put me against my family – it was really clever. When I started hanging around with them I felt important. 'I had no friends and they were the only people left to talk to. It was a big part of my life and I was scared. I felt like all my friends were making new memories and I wasn't part of them. 'Calling people ""slags"" as the defence did in this case stops other girls from coming forward. I would say to other girls to think about the future. I never wanted to do it. I never wanted to have sex with them but I thought that's what friends did.' Thames Valley Police launched Operation Reportage after receiving a tip-off about the men's activities and eventually tracked down numerous teenager girls who had been molested. Detective Inspector Steve Raffield from Banbury Force CID said: 'This result would not have been possible without the bravery of the victims. 'I would like to thank them for coming forward and giving evidence in this case. As in all trials without their testimony we would not be where we are today. 'As a result young people will be safeguarded while these men will have time to reflect upon their actions in prison.' Convicted: Takudzwa Hova, 21, (left) was sentenced to six years' imprisonment, while Zsolt Szalontai, 18, (right) was sentenced to three years' detention in a Young Offenders' Institute after being found guilty of rape . Justice: The judge rejected the argument put forward by the defence at Oxford Crown Court (pictured), who accused the girls of coming forward because 'it's better to be a victim than a slag' Those jailed on Friday afternoon at Oxford Crown Court were: Ahmed Hassan-Sule, 21, of Banbury, who was found guilty of 13 counts of sexual activity with a child and one count of assault by penetration. He was sentenced to nine years' imprisonment. Mohamed Saleh, 22, of Banbury, was found guilty of two counts of sexual activity with a child. He was sentenced to four years and nine months' imprisonment. Said Saleh, 20, from Banbury, was found guilty of one count of sexual activity with a child. He was sentenced to four years' detention in a Young Offenders Institute. Takudzwa Hova, 21, of Banbury, was found guilty of one count of sexual activity with a child, two counts of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and one count of rape. He was sentenced to six years' imprisonment. Kagiso Manase, 26, of Banbury, was found guilty of two counts of sexual activity with a child, two counts of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and one count of sexual assault. He was sentenced to four years' imprisonment. Manase had also pleaded guilty to possession of identity documents with intent. The offence related to being found in possession or control of a false South African passport and UK residence permit. He was sentenced to one year imprisonment to run consecutively. Zsolt Szalontai, 18, of Banbury, was found guilty of one count of rape.

"Two mistakes from Rangers keeper Robby McCrorie handed Celtic the Glasgow Cup as they clinched the trophy for the fourth time in eight seasons at Hampden. Josh Kerr took advantage when the Scotland under-17 star came for a corner and missed it to put the Hoops in front before McCrorie dropped a Mark Hill free kick over the line. With Old Firm bosses Ronny Deila and Stuart McCall looking on, it was the former who left happiest after seeing Tommy McIntyre’s side record a deserved victory. Celtic U17 players celebrate after beating Rangers 2-0 to win the Glasgow Cup at Hampden . Celtic goalscorer Josh Kerr holds the trophy in the air as he celebrates on Tuesday evening . Both teams line up ahead of the match which was played behind closed doors at Hampden Park . And as only local schoolkids and their parents were allowed in following trouble among fans at the last three finals, the match passed without any major off-field problems. Rangers took the game to their opponents but early headers from Aiden Wilson and Ross McCrorie ran past either post. Celtic hit back and began to dictate play, sitting further up the park the more time wore on and pressing well for an opener. Nine days after the Parkhead club’s first team was denied a clear penalty in the Scottish Cup against Inverness, their youths had another good claim. But Kyle Bradley’s handball in the box from a Regan Hendry shot went unnoticed by referee Stephen Graham before the midfielder fired the rebound straight at Robby McCrorie. Calvin Miller then shot just over from 20 yards, Hendry was denied again by McCrorie and Miller screwed another long-range drive inches wide as the Hoops looked more likely to net. Kerr fires the ball into the net to give Celtic the lead against Rangers in the 74th minute . Kerr slides along the Hampden pitch in celebration after putting Celtic ahead . Mark Hill (third left) is congratulated by his team-mates after doubling Celtic's lead . Just when it seemed they would get themselves in front, Hendry nodded past from close range when Miller picked him out with a great right-wing cross and it was a poor miss. Rangers were being restricted to playing on the counter and offered little in attack, with a low Ross Lyon shot that ran tamely wide being as close as they came. It took some strong defending to keep them level at the break too, with two last-gasp tackles from Wilson and Ross McCrorie being just enough to deny Hendry. Celtic kept pressing after the restart, with Theo Archibald firing a volley over and Rory Currie’s low attempt flashing off target. They almost paid for their slackness in front of goal, with Gers’ Sam Jamieson forcing a terrific tip over the bar from keeper Ross Doohan. Celtic manager Ronny Deila watches the U17 side claim victory in the Glasgow Cup . Rangers manager Stuart McCall (centre), assistant Kenny Black (left) and goalkeeping coach Jim Stewart watch the match from the stands at Hampden . The Light Blues took heart from that and began coming forward more but were just as sloppy with their finishing as Wilson nodded a Lyon corner over. Celtic responded once again, with Robby McCrorie smothering Mark Hill’s attempt, Dan Higgins aiming too high from 20 yards and McCrorie gathering Archibald’s grasscutter. Rangers made their best chances through Lyon and substitute Jamie Barjonas but rued their misses as Celtic scored twice in as many minutes and McCrorie was culpable both times. Celtic players celebrate in the dressing room at the national stadium in Glasgow . He failed to take Hendry’s corner when he tried to claim it with 16 minutes left and Kerr lashed in the loose ball from four yards. McCrorie’s error moments later was worse, however, as he fumbled into the net when a flighted Hill free kick came in from wide on the left. Rangers tried to get back into the game and Jamieson came closest but Doohan kept him out and that sealed Celts’ success.","Celtic U17 won the Glasgow Cup at Hampden Park on Tuesday night .

"A monkey that was thought to have died out more than 50 years ago has been discovered alive in the remote rain forests of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Primatologists working in Ntokou-Pikounda National Park have captured the first ever picture of the Bouvier's red colobus monkey. Their discovery proves that the primate - which was first discovered in 1887 and is only known from three specimens - is not extinct. Scroll down for video . This is the first ever photograph of the Bouvier's red colobus monkey, which was thought to have been extinct . The image captured by researchers Lieven Devreese and Gaël Elie Gnondo Gobolo appears to show a mother with her young. Researchers now hope to study the monkey in an attempt to learn more about it. A new species of monkey has been discovered after scientists learned to distinguish it by the appearance of its penis. The white-cheeked macaque was discovered in the remote highland forests of south-east Tibet after researchers set up camera traps. The monkey has a distinctive rounded penis rather than the arrow shaped genitalia found on other species in the area. Officially named Macaca leucogenys, it earned its common name due to the pale whiskers on its chin and the side of its face. Dr Pengfei Fan, one of the researchers who discovered the new species and a biologist at Dali University, Yunnan, in China, said the new macaque had long been misidentified as another species. He said that due to the remoteness of the location in Medog County of Tibet, few biologists had been there. Mr Devreese said: 'Our photos are the world's first and confirm that the species is not extinct. 'No one knows anything about them. They live in an area where scientists rarely go, along the banks of a river a in a very inaccessible area.' Mr Devreese spent three months, after setting off in February, searching the jungles of Congo in an attempt to find the Bouvier red colobus monkeys, or Piliocolobus bouvieri. Together with his Congelese colleagues, he visited remote villages to ask locals if they had seen them and traced the locations of unconfirmed reports of sightings. A group of the monkeys were discovered living in the forests that sit along the Bokiba River in the Ntokou-Pikounda National Park. However, they found that the creatures appear to be extremely vulnerable to hunters involved in the commercial bushmeat trade in the area. Red colobus monkeys are among the largest primates in the forests of Congo and are prized by hunters. The animals are also poor at recognising threats, often believing they are safe in the trees. Rather than fleeing, red colobus monkeys tend to look down at humans from the trees. The last unconfirmed sighting of a Bouvier's red colobus monkey was in the 1970s and they are mentioned in a book from 1949 as living in swamp forests aong the Likouala and Sangha rivers.

The Bouvier's red colobus monkey lives in stretches of jungle alongside rivers in the Congo (pictured above) The only previous examples of them had been collected more than 100 years ago. In his attempt to rediscover the monkeys, Mr Devreese launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise funds for the expedition on Indiegogo. Dr Fiona Maisels, from the Wildlife Conservation Society, said: 'We’re very pleased indeed that Lieven and Gaël were able to achieve their objective of not only confirming that Bouvier’s red colobus still exists, but also managing to get a very clear close-up picture of a mother and infant. 'Thankfully, many of these colobus monkeys live in the recently gazetted national park and are protected from threats such as logging, agriculture, and roads, all of which can lead to increased hunting.' James Deutsch, vice president for conservation strategy at the WCS, added: 'Confirmation that Bouvier’s red colobus still thrives in the this area reminds us that there remain substantially intact wild places on Earth, and should re-energize all of us to save them before it is too late.'","Bouvier's red colobus monkeys was last sighted in the Congo during 1970s .

"(CNN)There's an old saying which states the Cape Verde Islands are home to a greater number of musicians per square kilometer than any other country in the world. In truth, such a definitive claim may be nigh on impossible to prove. But there is a certain factual accuracy behind the legend: the important and proud relationship the Atlantic island country of just 500,000 people has with music. Situated roughly 350 miles off the west coast of Africa, Cape Verde has long been a mesh of cultures, history and races. The former Portuguese territory was once a key location for the transatlantic slave trade, a target for 16th century pirates and a refuge for exiled Jews. From this diverse melting pot were born the unique sounds of the batuque, morna, funana and other distinct musical styles. Now, Cape Verde is seeking to tap-into the spoils of this rich cultural heritage in a bid to help its economy flourish. Bereft of oil, gas, gold, diamonds or the conventional natural resources that have fueled growth in many other African countries, Cape Verde has had to look for alternative sectors to aid its development. And what's more alternative than a jiving, swinging, musical economy? ""Besides fish, it is pretty common (for Cape Verde) to say 'our biggest richness is in music and culture,'"" said Christine Semba of Womex, an international networking platform for the world music genre. The economic potential of music has been also acknowledged  by Cape Verde's prime minister, Jose Maria Neves, while the country's ministry of culture is run by Mario Lucio de Sousa, himself a popular musician. ""The future of our country lies in our capacity to create, our capacity to innovate,"" Neves said in reference to the music and the arts at a World Trade Organization conference in 2013. Other elements of the creative economy include handicrafts, fashion and visual arts to name but a few. However, a 2013 report from the UN Conference on Trade and Development noted that Cape Verde's creative sector remained a relatively small part of its economy with much room for improvement and long term planning. But that doesn't mean there hasn't been some promising early signs that music has the potential to play a key role in the future. One early musical success has been the Kriol Jazz Festival. The event, which is celebrating its seventh edition, took place in the capital city of Praia this past weekend. Artists including Grammy-winning U.S. singer Esperanza Spalding have been invited to perform, as have acts from the likes of Luxembourg, Brazil and, of course, Cape Verde. According to Harold Taveres, a liaison to the mayor of Praia involved with promoting the festival, ""KJF has become one of the most spectacular events in Cape Verde. ""We breathe the music in Cape Verde, we live with the music,"" he added. ""Now the festival has brought people from every corner in the world (to share in this)."" During the festival, bars, hotels and restaurants are full to the brim while taxi drivers are seldom unable to find a fare during what locals refer to as ""the week of party."" It's a lucrative trade, for sure. Yet in order to take full advantage of this bustling scene the country's ministry of culture, alongside some enterprising private sector figures, thought a deeper relationship with the music business was required. Enter the Atlantic Music Expo, a three-year-old conference and networking event that seeks to help Cape Verdean artists secure international exposure. This year's AME took place in the days before the Kriol Jazz Festival. Delegates, local musicians and their management teams were exposed to roundtables, workshops and talks on the intricacies of the global music business. ""We try to invite lots of producers and a lot of journalists from around the world to see the festival and the musicians from Cape Verde,"" said Jose Da Silva, long time manager of the late Cape Verdean songstress Cesaria Evora. Da Silva is one of the driving forces behind AME as well as being the founder of the Lusafrica and Harmonia record labels that aim to discover a new generation of artists from Cape Verde. He hopes that by exposing musicians to a range of experienced industry professionals and top-level musicians, they will become equipped with the tools and ambition to take the music of Cape Verde across the globe. Not only will this help launch the careers of artists and musicians (with all the respective behind the scenes business structures such developments require) but it will garner valuable attention for the country. This is where the greatest potential economic benefits lie. Tourism is expected to account for 20% of the country's GDP by 2024, according to research from the World Travel and Tourism Council. Getting Cape Verde's name out on the world stage through recognition of its rich musical culture is therefore increasingly important. ""Economically it's beneficial for the country because the money we would have to spend on the market to give the country this exposure in the world would be too big,"" Da Silva said. ""This way it costs less money."" Semba agrees with this, and highlights the joined up thinking of the government and private sector actors like Da Silva for special praise. ""In the long term, the whole country is behind this event,"" Semba said, adding ""this is a very innovative approach which we would like to see in many more countries."" It must be noted, however, that few countries have the same natural resources for music as Cape Verde. More from Marketplace Africa .","Cape Verde seeking to tap-into rich cultural heritage .

"Foreign workers will have to pay an average of £22,000 in tax before they can claim benefits under Tory plans to be unveiled this week. Migrants arriving in the UK will be banned from receiving handouts from the welfare state for four years, forcing them to pay tax and national insurance the state. Home Secretary Theresa May said the Tory manifesto will spell out plans to negotiate a new deal with Europe, including curbing access to benefits. Home Secretary Theresa May said the Tory manifesto will spell out plans to negotiate a new deal with Europe, including curbing access to benefits . Under the proposals, unemployed EU migrants in Britain will be banned from receiving state support, and would be deported if they do not get a job within six months of arriving. For those in work, they would be barred from claiming handouts like housing benefit or tax credits until they have being in the UK for four years. It means a migrant workers on an average wage will pay £22,600 in tax and national insurance over four years before they are able to receive state support. There will also be a ban on 'exporting' child benefit for children living in other EU countries. The crackdown was ordered after the government failed to meet David Cameron's target of cutting net migration to the tens of thousands. Latest figures show that in the year to September, 298,000 more people arrived in the UK than left. Mr Cameron rowed back from plans to limit freedom of movement across the EU after a backlash from German Chancellor Angela Merkel. But Mrs May today said the benefits changes would act to limit the appeal of coming to Britain from poorer parts of the EU. 'Our plan would remove a huge financial incentive for European migrants to come to Britain for the wrong reasons,' she told The Sun. 'Instead of claiming in-work benefits, under our plans the vast majority will pay into the system, contributing thousands of pounds.' Net long-term migration to the UK was estimated to be 298,000 in the year ending September 2014, a major rise on the 210,000 figure a year earlier . She said the Tories had made the immigration system 'fairer and more effective' than it was in 2010, but more was needed. The Home Secretary said: 'That's why our manifesto, which will be published this week, will spell out our plan to negotiate a new deal with Europe. 'The changes to welfare to cut EU migration will be a key part of our renegotiation with the EU, and we will put our reform package to the British people in a straight in-out referendum by the end of 2017. 'Labour oppose this plan, as they have opposed all the steps we have taken to create a fairer immigration system since 2010. Ukip talk a lot about immigration - but they don't have a serious plan for action.' Under the plans, migrants with jobs will only receive in-work benefits, such as tax credits, and social housing once they have been in the UK for four years. And no child benefits or tax credits for children living elsewhere in Europe will be paid out, regardless of how long an EU migrant has paid into UK coffers under the plans. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said immigration was important for Britain but it needed to be 'controlled and managed'. Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said immigration was important for Britain but it needed to be 'controlled and managed' She told Sky News' Murnaghan programme: 'The practical policies are that we want to make sure we have stronger border controls and that means having 1,000 more border staff to actually do proper checks to follow up on visas.' Labour, she added, would change the benefit rules so that people coming to Britain could not claim benefits until they had been in the country for more than two years. She said: 'It's not happening, what have they done in the last five years, they haven't dealt with it. And the thing that is different about our approach compared to any other party is we would deal with the exploitation by agencies, recruitment agencies and employers, who are exploiting immigration to undercut wages and jobs, that makes the system unfair. 'You've got some recruitment agencies who are recruiting from abroad, we would change the law, make exploitation a crime.' The Conservatives, she added, should not be trying to restrict overseas university students at the same time as 'doing nothing' about illegal immigration.","Conservatives will ban in-work benefits for migrants for four years .

"Tony Pulis has discussed pre-season plans with Saido Berahino in an indication he plans to keep the striker beyond the summer transfer window. Berahino is likely to be away with Gareth Southgate’s England under 21 side in the Czech Republic until late June so Pulis has begun his preparations early. West Bromwich Albion were open to bids of £20million for Berahino in January and the 21-year-old has said he would leave to fulfil his desire to play in Champions League football. West Brom manager Tony Pulis has talked pre-season plans with Saido Berahino in an indication the England under 21 striker will remain at The Hawthorns beyond the summer . Berahino has been linked with a move away from West Brom after saying he wants to play European football . Pulis said: ‘Hopefully he's away with the under 21s so I have had a chat with him about pre-season and the time he'll have off but I haven't spoken about anything else to him. ‘I think the kid is happy here, he has played that way and certainly worked that way. We're more than happy to have him here because he has been very good.’ Berahino shares the same agent as Raheem Sterling, Aidy Ward, who was criticised by Brendan Rodgers over the Liverpool player’s contract stand-off. Pulis said: ‘Agents can have a massive influence on players in lots of respects. My argument to that is in the same in life, you get good agents and you get bad agents. Berahino is likely to be included in the England under 21 squad for this summer's European Championships . Berahino scored a vital goal in England's under 21 play-off with Croatia back in October . 'Professional footballers have been given a gift and they have a lifespan of about 10-12 years. We should never forget that. To be the best is what they should be aiming for. ‘If I had an agent I'd just say, 'Look after the money, make sure when I finish this job I have enough to look after my family'. I wouldn't be talking to my agent about football.’ Pulis added: ‘I can’t speak for Sterling and I can't speak for the agent as I haven't dealt with that but the one thing I have said about Saido, he has been fantastic here. ‘There's been a real change in his attitude, his commitment to everything we've tried to do has been brilliant.’","Pulis has spoken with his striker about pre-season plans .

"(CNN)A photo of a baby boy being pulled from the rubble of the Nepal earthquake has become the defining image of a disaster that has devastated the country. His tiny face is coated in dust from the debris that crashed around him as the earth shook on Saturday, April 25, killing more than 5,000 people and injuring at least twice as many more. His name is Sonit Awal, and he's just four months old. On Saturday, Sonit was at home in Muldhoka, Bhaktapur, east of the capital Kathmandu, when the 7.8-magnitude quake sent tremors through Nepal and neighboring countries, according to Kathmandu Today. The house collapsed, burying the child, leaving his father Shyam Awal frantically searching for him amid the rubble. A desperate Awal called the Nepalese Army, and they too scrambled through the dirt and debris until midnight, before giving up hope and leaving. Sonit's father had lost all hope of finding his son alive, the paper reported, until he heard faint cries from below. On Sunday morning, the soldiers returned and at 10 a.m they lifted Sonit clear of the fallen rocks, beams, bricks and dust that had trapped him for 22 hours. His rescuers held him high in their hands to the sun, though his eyes were still wedged tightly shut. Sonit's face was exposed during the whole ordeal, though a hooded top and shawl protected his head and body during the cold night spent under rubble.

"A young Star Wars fan, who wrote a heartwarming note to the movies’ creator George Lucas asking whether he would allow Jedi Knights to marry in the future, was elated to receive a reply granting his request. Seven-year-old Colin Gilpatric, an aspiring Jedi Knight, was devastated to learn that achieving his dream might mean never being able to marry, as forming emotional attachments is said by the rules of the fictional order to lead Jedis to the 'dark side'. Desperate for a solution, Colin, who has autism, went directly to the man in charge: Star Wars director and writer Mr Lucas. Plea by post: Seven-year-old aspiring Jedi Colin sent a letter to George Lucas asking him to change the rule that bans the Knights from marrying . As character Anakin Skywalker's marriage to Princess Amidala led him to become a villain - and lord of the malevolent Sith Order, Darth Vader - Colin wanted to avoid the same fate, and pleaded with the Star Wars creator to make a change to the rules. 'With Colin, he was obsessing about it,' Colin's mother Peggy Gilpatric told Inside Edition: 'Finally, I was like, you know what, write to George Lucas and tell him how you feel and that's all that you can do.' 'Dear George Lucas,' Colin wrote in his letter. 'I don't like that a Jedi cannot get married. I want to get married without becoming a Sith. Please change the rule. 'P.S. I want to come to Skywalker Ranch please, Love Colin.' Soon enough, a package from Lucasfilm arrived for Colin in the mail, and his mother Peggy was on hand to film him opening it up. The letter: Colin, desperate not to end up like Anakin Skywalker - aka Darth Vader - in the film series, made his case to the Star Wars creator . The big reveal: Colin's mother filmed her son's ecstatic response as he realizes the package contains a plethora of Star Wars merchandise . In the video, Colin is ecstatic to find a stash of Star Wars goodies in the bag, including books and toys, accompanied by a letter addressing his question. 'It sounds like the Force is strong with you, and you are showing great wisdom by asking your question,' it said. 'To be a Jedi is to truly know the value of friendship, of compassion, and of loyalty, and these are values important in a marriage. The Sith think inward, only of themselves. 'When you find someone that you can connect to in a selfless way, then you are on the path of the light, and the dark side will not take hold of you. With this goodness in your heart, you can be married.' The letter was signed 'Your friends at Lucasfilm'. 'The Force is strong with me!': Colin is elated to have his question answered . Quite the response: Lucasfilm sent this letter to seven-year-old Colin to ease his mind about one day being able to get married . In the video showing Colin reading the letter for the first time, the young fan is delighted to say the least, exclaiming: 'I can get married? No way!' According to Colin's mother, the obsession with Star Wars has been a godsend for her son, who, as a result of his autism, struggles to share his emotions. 'A lot of autistic kids have a hard time understand processing emotions and the entire Star Wars universe has helped us that way,'she told Inside Edition. 'It’s very black and white. There’s a dark side and good side. 'It helped open up a dialogue about it feelings and emotions. There is a conception that some autistic kids don’t have emotions, but they do. It’s just finding the right outlet for them and the right way to express it.'","Traditional Jedi rules forbid any knights from marrying because it is thought it will lead them to the ‘dark side’

"A mutilated fox: hardly the most glamorous prop Ashley James has ever posed with, but in this case, that is precisely the point. The former Made In Chelsea star has joined forces with animal rights crusaders PETA on a hard-hitting anti-fur campaign directed at Harvey Nichols after the national department store abandoned its ten-year anti-fur policy. 'Harvey Nichols: Here's the Rest of Your Fur Coat,' the slogan reads, alongside an image of the 26-year-old animal lover, who is brandishing what appears to be a skinned fox - a fake one we've been assured. Scroll down for video . Dark: The former Made in Chelsea star has joined forces with animal rights crusaders PETA on a hard-hitting anti-fur campaign directed at Harvey Nichols after it abandoned its fur-free policy - (the fox isn't real) PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) is currently in talks with a number of billboard companies in the hopes of getting the poster mounted outside Harvey Nichols. 'I love animals,' Ashley told MailOnline. 'Having educated myself about the fur industry, it breaks my heart to think people allow such cruelty to continue by buying fur products.' Harvey Nichols, which has 12 locations around the world and previously stood against the fur industry, backtracked last year when it quietly re-introduced it. Priced between £300 and £1,500, the department store's current range includes coyote fur courtesy of Canada Goose, raccoon fur from Charlotte Simone and plenty of rabbit pelts from Vince. 'When I see people I know wearing fur, I will initiate the conversation by asking them if it's real or not. If they confirm that it's real, I express disgust,' Ashley said, . 'If they are interested, then I will tell them more about this cruel industry. I just want people to make informed decisions with their purchases.

'If they know about the industry and still choose to wear fur, then that's fine - although I can't personally understand how they could do that. 'But I think a lot of people prefer to live in ignorance, and that's really frustrating.' In a statement to MailOnline, Harvey Nichols said: '[We are] committed to sustainable and responsible practice across all areas of [our] business, and ethical trading is an important part of this programme. 'We only source products from reputable brands, which includes seeking the assurance that the fur they use in products has been sourced responsibly.' However, in a recent exposé fronted by Paloma Faith, PETA went undercover on 'Origin Assured' fur farms, a label which is meant to give fur-stocking stores assurances about the animal welfare and conditions in which animals are bred and slaughtered. It found raccoons, rabbits and minks kept in filthy wire cages, sometimes alongside the rotting corpses of other animals. 'These animals were left to suffer from untreated injuries, including missing limbs,' PETA reports. 'Frightened and distressed, they often mutilate themselves and others in the cage, only to be slaughtered in the name of fashion.'

PETA's foundation director Mimi Bekhechi points out: 'All fur is the product of a bloody, violent industry. We encourage consumers not to be deceived by Harvey Nichols' claims of selling 'humanely and ethically' obtained furs.' Before Ashley James knew anything about the industry, she admits she owned a rabbit fur coat. 'Needless to say I don't any more,' she said. 'I gave it to a Romanian charity called K-9 Angels, which use donated furs to keep rescued dogs warm in winter.'

Harvey Nichols is not the only entity, or person, to have broken its anti-fur promise.

Virgil Hunter, California-based trainer of both Ward and Amir Khan, says: 'Smith is who we want and I'm told it's a done deal. But it won't be for Andre's belt even though it will be over the 12-round championship distance.' The WBA have ordered their two super-middle world champions – Ward 'super,' Froch 'regular' – to meet in a unification fight. Froch declared willingness if Ward returns the compliment by travelling to the UK, having won their first meeting in the US.

Froch (left) stands alongside James DeGale before a television appearance in Liverpool last July . Ward said he would make the away trip but only as far as London, not to Nottingham where Froch has long desired to box on his hometown City Ground. Hunter declares: 'Andre would have gladly taken Carl straight away.' But now it appears the WBA are granting the so-called Son of God licence to shake off the ring rust where he almost always fights, in his native city across the Bay from San Francisco. Froch, meanwhile, is turning his attention to his other remaining ambition before retirement – a first appearance on the Las Vegas Strip, against the namesake son of Mexican legend Julio Cesar Chavez.

"The producers of the TV show Made In Chelsea pride themselves on featuring some of the poshest young ladies and gentleman in London. But even by their standards, Mark-Francis Vandelli is well-to-do - the privately educated son of a multimillionaire industrialist and model wouldn't have to work a day in his life if he chose not to. But if you weren't already envious of the reality star, he has now opened up his watch collection to the Evening Standard, showing off some of the 16 eye-wateringly expensive timepieces that he has been collecting since his teens. Scroll down for video . Made In Chelsea star Mark-Francis Vandelli is a keen collector of expensive watches . The 26 year old has got into the habit of buying a new watch each year, so that he will have an impressive collection by the time he reaches middle age. Many watch enthusiasts would argue that Mark-Francis has already reached that goal - he currently owns a number of pieces that are worth several thousand pounds. In a new interview with the newspaper, he revealed his favourite items and the history behind them. The include a Bulgari Bulgari Chrono 42, a Cartier Tortue Collection Privée and a Rolex yellow gold Oyster Perpetua. Mark-Francis's most expensive watch is a Cartier white gold Moonphase, which he bought from a shop on Sloane Street in Chelsea earlier this year. Mark-Francis's most expensive watch is a Cartier white gold Moonphase (left), while one of his flashiest is a  Bulgari Bulgari Chrono 42 (right) It cost £32,000 and caught his eye because it has a sun or a moon than move on rotation depending on the hour of the day. One of the flashiest watches in his collection is the Bulgari Bulgari Chrono 42, which he purchased on holiday in Italy and can be bought secondhand on the internet for £6,5000. He said of the item: 'When I was 16 my grandmother gave me the first prototype of the Bulgari Bulgari, which the Bulgari family had given her in the 1950s - I think it's one of the only ones that was actually hand engraved around the bezel.' Mark-Francis ended up buying this modern version after he fell into a river wearing his grandmother's version while out rowing at school. Mark Francis favours a Cartier Tortue Collection Privée timepiece because it is no longer made (left), while he wears a Rolex yellow gold Oyster Perpetual when out raving in East London (right) While many of his watches are hard to come by, Mark Francis favours a Cartier Tortue Collection Privée timepiece in particular because it is no longer made, meaning he would be unlikely to be caught out wearing it at the same time as another man. Similar versions can be bought on the internet for around £9,000. He told the newspaper: 'Cartier doesn't make this one any more, which I love. I did see someone else wearing it once, however -  I was at the Wolseley and it was this fat American, I was mortified.' And finally, for the man who has a watch for every occasion - the timepiece that he wears when visiting East London... a Rolex yellow gold Oyster Perpetual. Similar watches can be bought on the internet for £8,000. He said: 'You can swim in it, sleep in it, throw it around, go to a rave. This is my hardwearing, ""I'm going to Shoreditch"" watch.'","Mark-Francis Vandelli is a keen collector of expensive watches .

The former Coronation Street star, whose collections have been a stellar success for the brand, has been hard at work in the design studio to bring fans exactly what they want for the warmer months. As the clothes horse shows, her new range is full of colourful print playsuits, cool crochet and lots of sophisticated lace. Michelle, 27,  shows off her summer tan and enviable curves in the new campaign imagery . Michelle says her beauty regime is fairly minimal and she simply cleanses, tones and moisturises every day and treats herself to a facial every other week to rehydrate her skin . Speaking to FEMAIL recently, Michelle revealed the regime that keeps her fit, healthy and glowing from the inside out. Sharing her top tanning tips for a flawless faux glow as she shows off her natural beauty in behind the scenes imagery, Michelle advised: 'Always exfoliate first and not just knees and elbows, all over your body. 'Next, I moisturise all over and then use Garnier Dry Body Mist all over my body, including the underside of my arms.' The star, who says her ultimate beauty secrets are simply drinking lots of water and always taking her make-up off before bed, also swears by LVL eyelash treatments. LVL, which stands for length, volume and lift, flicks, curls and straightens lashes from the roots up so they appear much longer. 'It helps make my lashes darker and more voluminous,' says Michelle of the treatment, which takes an hour and a half and lasts over two months.

The star, 27, says she's always been a fan of the range and has been using it for years so when they asked her to work with them, she was 'over the moon' The star also spoke about how important looking good was to her and how she takes a 'less is more' approach to make-up. Her beauty regime is fairly minimal and she simply cleanses, tones and moisturises every day and treats herself to a facial every other week to rehydrate her skin. She swears by Simple face wipes, Origins serums and Garnier and Kiehl's moisturisers.

The flawless star, who found fame on Coronation Street, reveals that her simple but effective beauty secrets are  drinking lots of water and always taking her make-up off before bed . The actress likes to snack on fruit, nuts and her favourite treat: popcorn. Bodywise, Michelle says she tries to work out as much as possible and whilst there's 'always an excuse not to go', she ends up feeling better after a workout. 'I've been very busy at the moment but if I have time, I go to the gym 3-4 times per week.' She doesn't, however, do any cardio and simply sticks to weight training to tone up. 'Cardio is good for getting you sweating but it slims you down and I think it makes me look too skinny,' she admitted. She also swears by the 8-minute abs YouTube video, which she does when she gets home from the gym. As for the future, Michelle says she 'may consider' doing an accessories and jewellery range but for now, she's focussing on her acting duties.

""With his Iran deal, Barack Obama is for the 300 million souls of the United States what Andreas Lubitz was for the 150 souls on the German Wings flight - a deranged pilot flying his entire nation into the rocks,"" the Minnesota Republican and former representative wrote in a Facebook comment posted March 31. ""After the fact, among the smoldering remains of American cities, the shocked survivors will ask, why did he do it?"" Andreas Lubitz, the co-pilot of Germanwings Flight 9525, is accused by authorities of deliberately crashing the plane in the French Alps. He died in the crash along with 149 other crew and passengers. The motive of the March 24 crash is under investigation, though investigators are looking in to whether Lubitz feared a medical condition would cause him to lose his pilot's license. Many comments posted on her Facebook page blasted the former representative. Melissa Coca wrote, ""Comparing this tragedy to anything is moronic and despicable."" Michael J Pristash wrote, ""Your allusion is so inappropriate and divisive, not to mention disrespectful on so many levels. Shame on you."" Some also accused her of taking desperate measures to stay in the public eye. Lynda Anderson wrote, ""Posting outrageous things in a pathetic attempt to stay relevant?"" Negotiations are coming down to the wire between Iran, the United States and other nations on restricting Tehran's nuclear program to prevent the ability to develop an atomic bomb. One deadline passed Tuesday, but there is a June 30 deadline for a comprehensive deal -- with all technical and diplomatic impasses fully worked out. Bachmann is no stranger to voicing her opinion on the President's dealing with Iran, personally telling him to ""bomb Iran"" during the 2014 White House Christmas Party. ""I turned to the president and I said, something to the effect of, 'Mr. President, you need to bomb the Iranian nuclear facilities, because if you don't, Iran will have a nuclear weapon on your watch and the course of world history will change,'"" she told the Washington Free Beacon.

"The widow of US Navy SEAL Chris Kyle has revealed the painful moment she first broke the news to their two children that their father had been murdered. Taya Kyle told ABC's Robin Roberts she gathered her son, Colton and daughter, McKenna and prepared to tell them. 'I remembered just closing my eyes, the tears rolling down and me just trying to breathe,' said Kyle. Reveal: Taya Kyle had to do everything she could from falling apart in front of her kids when she explained to them their father had been killed . Recovery: Taya has given an interview to 20/20s Robin Roberts about her life since Eddie Ray Routh was convicted of killing her husband, American Sniper, Chris Kyle . Taya, 40, was speaking to Roberts for a special edition of ABC News' 20/20 which will air on Friday, May 1 and will catch up with the widow of Kyle, whose story is portrayed in the blockbuster movie, American Sniper. It will be the first in-depth interview that Kyle has given since former Marine Eddie Ray Routh was found guilty of capital murder on February 24 for shooting dead Chris Kyle and his friend, Chad Littlefield. He was automatically handed a life sentence without the possibility of parole and Taya Kyle broke down in tears on the stand when she gave evidence on the first day of the trial. During the course of their interview, Kyle jokes with Roberts that she never thought she would marry 'a cowboy' but was 'excited' by falling in love with him. 'I never probably thought a cowboy would want me,' she said. 'And I said I would never marry somebody -- a SEAL either. So… 'there you go with your plans again,' right?' Family: Chris Kyle (pictured unshaven) proudly poses with his son, Colton and daughter, Mckenna and wife Taya after leaving active service  in around 2012 . Taxing and emotional testimony: Taya Kyle wipes the tears from her eyes as she gives evidence from the stand during the trial of Chris Kyle's killer, Eddie Ray Routh in February . Eddie Ray Routh pleaded not guilty to killing Chris Kyle and said that he shot him and his friend Chad Littlefield dead because he was suffering PTSD. The jury decided he was guilty of murder and knew what he was doing . Taya has also written a new book, 'American Wife: A Memoir of Love, War, Faith and Renewal' which will go into detail about her marriage and the aftermath of Chris's death. The book is released on May 4 and Taya hopes it will draw a line under her recent events. In March, Taya published a heartbreaking letter to mark their 13th wedding anniversary. Taya Kyle pledged to love her late husband 'all the days of my life' in the touching tribute in which she described the moment her future husband gave her two dozen roses during one of their first dates. Kyle, who was the subject of last year's Clint Eastwood-directed movie American Sniper, was gunned down by fellow war veteran Eddie Ray Routh at a shooting range in Rough Creek, Texas, on February 2, 2013. Taya Kyle was the first witnesses called during the trial. The judge also allowed her to attend the public gallery afterwards to watch the trial . American Sniper: Eddie Ray Routh shot Chris Kyle dead in February of 2013. In February of 2015 he was found guilty for the death of the war hero . That day, Kyle had offered to help Routh deal with his post traumatic stress disorder but was instead shot dead along with his friend Chad Littlefield. Now, in the wake of a turbulent year that involved her husband's killer's trial and an appearance at the Academy Awards for the film made in his name, Mrs Kyle has written of her enduring love for her husband. Posted on Facebook in March, her letter said: 'I feel you in my heart and soul so strongly. I am more blessed to have been your wife than anything else in my life. 'Today, I am thinking of our new relationship, when you rented a boutique hotel room in San Diego and surprised me with two dozen long stem pink roses when we arrived. You got us tickets to a local improv type play. I knew then I was the luckiest girl in the world to be with tough, romantic, loving you. 'Today, I have a choice. I can bury myself under the covers and acknowledge the pain of missing you and mourn the future anniversaries without you. Or, I can celebrate never having a day without you in my heart because you loved me enough to leave me a lifetime of memories and beauty. 'I am somewhere in between today. I loved you yesterday, I love you know, and I will love you all the days of my life.' Kyle was considered the deadliest sniper in American history, with his kill count thought to number about 160 confirmed, with many more probable kills.","Taya Kyle, 40 remembers crying as she told her young son and daughter .

"Rome (CNN)The Italian navy has boarded and retaken control of a fishing boat that had been seized hours earlier by gunmen off the coast of Sicily, the Italian military said Friday. The boat, named Airone, was intercepted some 90 kilometers (56 miles) from the Libyan port of Misrata, according to a statement from the Italian Joint Forces. An Italian naval unit boarded the fishing boat and took custody of a Libyan soldier on the vessel, according to a statement by the Italian Navy. It said during the operation, rifle shots were accidentally fired, and one of the seven fisherman on board was slightly injured. The Airone, carrying three Sicilians and four Tunisians, had embarked from Mazara del Vallo in Sicily five days earlier to fish for shrimp. The Airone's captain said there were about 10 other ships in the area when it was seized, according to Vito Mazzarino, the boat's owner. ""At a certain point a tug boat came up and flanked the fish boat and some Libyans came on board,"" Mazzarino said, quoting the captain, Alberto Figuccia. ""They were armed. And at that point chaos erupted."" Italy is a major gateway to Europe for migrants from North Africa. Thousands of people each year make the dangerous sea journey from North Africa to Europe's Mediterranean coast, to flee war and poverty. Italy registered more than 10,000 migrants in the first three months of 2015, according to the International Organization for migration. On Monday, gunmen on a speedboat fired shots in the air and sped away with a wooden boat that was being used to transport migrants, according to Frontex, the European Union's border management agency. That incident occurred 60 nautical miles from the Libyan coast. The 250 migrants on board had already been transferred on to a different boat, Frontex said on its website. ""This is a sign that smugglers in Libya are running short of boats and are more willing to use weapons to recover those used to transport the migrants,"" said Fabrice Leggeri, Frontex's executive director, in a news release.

"A virulent strain of bird flu continues to hammer the Midwest and the virus recently took its biggest toll yet after it hit a farm in Iowa that held nearly 10 percent of the state's egg-laying chickens. Poultry producers and scientists had been hoping warmer weather would knock down the deadly bird flu virus. But the U.S. Department of Agriculture said Monday that the H5N2 bird flu virus had been found at a farm in northwest Iowa's Osceola County - prompting a massive bird cull. Bird flu: Chickens stand in their cages at a farm near Stuart, Iowa. Discovery of the bird flu on an Iowa turkey farm has raised serious concerns that the bird killer could find its way into chicken barns in the nation's top egg-producing state and rapidly decimate the flocks that provide the U.S. with its breakfast staple . The confirmation means up to 5.3 million hens there must be destroyed in a state that produces one in every five eggs consumed in the country. Seven other Midwestern states have also been hit by the virus, dooming nearly 7.8 million turkeys and chickens since March. The virulent strain in question is the H5N2, a highly contagious virus that kills commercial poultry quickly once it gets into a barn. Yet the risk to the public is considered low and infected birds are being kept out of the food supply. So far, only two egg operations have been hit — the one in Iowa and one in Wisconsin. Except for a couple of backyard flocks, all the other cases in the Midwest have been at commercial turkey farms. Minnesota has had 28 turkey farms hit, far more than any other state. Turkey farm: In this photo provided by Bethany Hahn is a flock of turkeys at a Minnesota poultry farm. The country's poultry industry may have to live with a deadly bird flu strain for several years according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture . Precautions: Most commercial poultry barns are shut tight to keep the diseases out, and poultry farms with good biosecurity strictly limit who is allowed in - but is does not always protect poultry from bird flu . Officials say that's because Minnesota is the top turkey-producing state, and its thousands of lakes and ponds are attractive to migrating ducks and other waterfowl. H5N2 and other highly pathogenic strains have also been found since late last year among wild birds, backyard flocks and commercial farms in some western states and British Columbia. U.S. Department of Agriculture officials say the virus could be a problem for several years. The USDA's chief veterinary officer, Dr. John Clifford, said last week that while new cases should drop close to zero once the weather warms up and kills off the virus there's 'very likely' to be a resurgence this fall when the wild waterfowl that are natural carriers of avian influenza fly south for the winter. An outbreak that kills tens of thousands of birds certainly can cost a farm dearly. The government doesn't compensate producers for birds that die of the disease itself, but it does reimburse them for birds that have to be euthanized as a precaution. That gives farmers an incentive to report suspected outbreaks and deal with them swiftly. Outbreaks do not always drive up the cost of turkey eggs and chicken as the toll nationwide represents just a small part of U.S. production. Hormel Foods Corp., which owns Jennie-O, said Monday that it will sell less turkey this year because of the outbreaks. Turkey prices around the holidays often have nothing to do with the costs of production. Retailers often sell turkeys at a loss just to draw in customers who'll stock up on stuffing mix, cranberries, sweet potatoes, pies and other traditional favorites. However, several precautions have been put in place at farms to control the outbreak and stop the spread of bird flu. Most commercial poultry barns are shut tight to keep the diseases out, and poultry farms with good biosecurity strictly limit who is allowed in. Other precautions  include workers often having to shower on their way in and out, wear protective coveralls and step in disinfectant to kill viruses on their boots. Equipment coming in and out is typically sanitized. But despite these measures, the system doesn't always work. According to experts, the only way it can work is if everyone does everything right all of the time - which can prove difficult. And if rodents and wild birds sneak into a barn it can bring the virus that way. Farms tend to be extremely diligent at handling  bird flu as turkeys die quickly and know how to spit the early warning signs. Less severe symptoms can be similar to colds and flu in humans, or a flock turning quiet. While vaccines have been used around the world to protect flocks against various bird flu strains ahead of time, this strain is new to North America. Once an infection is confirmed at a farm, all surviving birds on the property are typically killed to prevent it from spreading. These flocks are usually killed by pumping a water-based foam into the barn, following guidelines from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The foam suffocates the birds within minutes. If birds die they usually cover them in compost in the same barn where they died. Composting is a widely used and approved method throughout the industry to dispose of dead birds. It's thought to be an effective method as the heat generated by composting is enough to kill flu viruses and other pathogens commonly present in poultry such as salmonella. The compost is then used as fertilizer.","The deadly H5N2 bird flu virus has been found at a farm in northwest Iowa .

"Carol Chandler at Southwark Crown Court to answer charges of historic sexual abuse . A female teacher accused of abusing a pupil at Chancellor George Osborne’s old school appeared in court today. Carol Chandler, 53, allegedly molested a boy, under the age of 14 who was a pupil at top independent school St Paul’s in Barnes, south west London, during the 1980s. She is facing three counts of indecent assault and two counts of gross indecency between 1983 and 1985. Chandler appeared at Southwark Crown Court in a mint green wool skirt suit, black court shoes and silver jewellery. The charges have not yet been formally put and Chandler has not entered pleas. Judge Jeffrey Pegden QC told Chandler: ‘Yes madam, you have heard the next important hearing date for the case is going to be on 9 July.’ He added: ‘I renew your bail until that date on the single condition that is obviously necessary and I am sure you wouldn’t dream of it anyway - not to contact directly or indirectly any prosecution witnesses.’ Occupying a 45-acre site beside the Thames, near Hammersmith Bridge, St Paul’s boasts facilities including a purpose-built art gallery and 230-seat theatre, which are second to none. Famous former pupils of the top school, established in 1509, include the Chancellor, who attended the £32,000-a-year school in the eighties, Mumford and Sons banjo player Winston Marshall and TV presenter Dan Snow.

"If it feels as though summer has come early, that’s because we’re already enjoying August temperatures. This week’s remarkable spell of sunshine in southern England is to continue – and warm up. The temperature in the South is forecast to reach 24C (75F) today and 25C (77F) tomorrow, surpassing the highest seen so far this year, the 21.9C (71.4F) recorded in London on Friday. The delightful weather, caused by warm air blowing up from the Azores, is creating conditions we might usually experience in July or August. Scroll down for video . Beach life: People enjoy the weather at Barry Island  in south Wales yesterday, as most of England and Wales enjoys  warm spring conditions .

Unusual sight: A man appears to walk across a rainbow at the beach at Barry Island, near Cardiff in south Wales yesterday . Stunning: A fog bank rolling onto Portsmouth from the Solent, after cool air moved quickly over the surface of the warm water . Britons are so confident of a scorching summer that bookmakers are receiving tens of thousands of pounds in bets on this year breaking records. The record for the hottest day ever in Britain was set more than a decade ago in August 2003 when temperatures hit 38.1C (101F) in Gravesend, Kent. Coral’s price on this summer being the hottest on record has fallen from 10/1 to 2/1, while Ladbrokes has 5/6 on this spring being the warmest ever. There has been a surge in bets after the recent warm weather, and William Hill has 8/1 odds that the temperature will exceed 100F (37.8C) this year. Ladbrokes is also offering 8/1 that the April record of 29.4C (84.9F) set in 1949 in Camden, north London, will be broken by the end of the month. The forecast for today is actually warmer than the 18C (64F) average daytime temperature in August, and way ahead of the 11C (52F) normally expected in April. This weekend will be slightly cooler than the dizzy heights expected tomorrow, but the clear skies and above-average temperatures are forecast to last well into next week. Met Office spokesman Laura Young said last night: ‘We are expecting some really good temperatures over the next few days. Unless you are in north-west Scotland, which will see quite a lot of rain, it will be dry and sunny. ‘On Tuesday we could see 23C to 25C (73F to 77F) in prolonged sunshine. That is double the daytime average for this time of year. ‘Wednesday will be 22C to 25C (72F to 77F) or higher in places. Thursday will probably be slightly cooler but still in the high teens. Wednesday warmth: Most of England and Wales will enjoy sunshine over the next few days with temperatures hitting 24C later this week . Peak District awakening: The morning mist looking out across the Derbyshire village of Foolow, near Grindleford, which woke to a frost . Going for a walk: A deer in the morning mist near Foolow in Derbyshire yesterday, as Britons prepared for the warmest weather of the year so far . ‘There is a cold air mass arriving on Thursday night but it is expected to stay dry well into next week. After that we can be less certain.’ The spell of warm weather, which has now lasted more than a week, has seen people flocking to the nation’s beaches. Among them were swimmers in the South-West who were stunned to see giant jellyfish in the waters. Barrel jellyfish, which have tentacles up to six feet long, were spotted near Hope Cove in south Devon. The species are usually found in the sunnier climes of the Mediterranean, but the rising temperatures and warmer seas have meant that more plankton becomes available and the jellyfish have headed closer to shore. The species is harmless to humans, but with the weather warming up then other jellyfish could be heading our way. Beachgoers are advised not to touch jellyfish in case they have chanced upon a species with a powerful sting. Devon vet Rupert Kirkwood, whose son Henry had an encounter with one of the jellyfish while kayaking, said: ‘No doubt they are encouraged to put in an appearance by the sunny weather. I have never seen them so early in the year. Could be the start of a bumper jellyfish year.’ After the bad smog seen late last week in the South-East, the air will be relatively clear for most parts over the next few days. Poor visibility: A fog-shrouded Brighton seafront yesterday, in stark contrast to yesterday's sunshine, as more warm temperatures are on the way . Apocalypse wow! It could be a poster for the 1979 Vietnam War film, but this stunning sunrise, behind dredger Britannia Beaver, painted the skies in Gravesend, Kent . Spectacular start: The sun rises over fishing boats off the North East coast near Cullercoats bay in North Tyneside yesterday morning . Over the water: Sunrise near Cullercoats bay in North Tyneside, as Britain basked in the hottest temperatures of the year so far . But pollution levels will increase again on Thursday and Friday, particularly in the South-West, where Cornwall and Devon are expected to see fumes rise to dangerous levels. The Met Office three-month contingency forecast for public officials predicts that there is an average chance of a warmer than usual summer. But thankfully the chances of it being much colder than usual is just 10 per cent. A spokesman said: ‘Unfortunately, the weather we get in April doesn’t necessarily tell us anything about the kind of summer we can expect. ‘We’re still in the midst of spring, so it’s far too early to say what the months of June, July and August may hold.’ Ladbrokes spokesman David Williams said yesterday: ‘The money flooding in on weather bets is unusual and has taken us a bit by surprise. ‘This is the first time we have seen quite significant sums wagered on this specific bet - so obviously people out there sense something hot is coming.’ And Nicola McGeady from Coral added: 'The British public are obsessed with the weather and that is reflected in the interest in weather betting.' Hot day: These graphics show the cloud coverage and temperatures tomorrow, with the South East expected to have the best weather . Arriving: The predicted hot weather this week is the result of a plume of warm air heading towards the UK from the south west . Green for cold, red for hot: These graphics from Netweather show the forecast temperatures for tomorrow (left) and Wednesday (right) A third of weather bets to Ladbrokes have come from punters in the South East - the area that has enjoyed the best conditions over the past week. And the bookmaker said its biggest bet of the year so far has been £1,000 on 2015 to be the hottest year on record at 8/1 - placed in January. Meanwhile, Coral - MailOnline's official betting partner - said it has even had a request from someone asking to bet on rain every day this summer. The Met Office has confirmed that hotter-than-average temperatures are more than twice as likely than below-average conditions until June. It said in a long-range forecast that ‘much of the tropical Pacific Ocean remains warmer than average and close to El Nino thresholds’. El Nino - the warming of Pacific sea surface temperatures - can trigger drought in south-east Asia and Australia as well as floods in South America. The Met Office says most climate models ‘now suggest that sea surface temperatures will exceed El Nino thresholds in late spring or early summer’. With Britain set to bask in its hottest temperatures of the year so far this week, thousands of parents and children are expected to head to the beach. But firefighters have warned those thinking about stripping off and diving into the water - with more than 650 water-related deaths in the UK in 2013. The act, known as ‘tombstoning’, can lead to people suffering ‘cold water shock’ when the air temperature is much higher than that of the water. London Fire Brigade assistant commissioner Peter Cowup said: ‘Rivers, lakes and canals may look inviting, especially on a hot day and after a drink. ‘But it’s important to realise that open water has hidden dangers that can hurt you and at worse, kill you.’ On the first-ever Drowning Prevention and Water Safety Week, firefighters added that the 16-30 age group was worst-hit by water deaths in 2013. Giant jellyfish are being spotted off Britain earlier than normal thanks to the warm weather, it was claimed yesterday. Kayaker Rupert Kirkwood, a seasoned sea watcher, was stunned to see the giant creatures off Hope Cove in Devon. The barrel jellyfish, which have tentacles up to 6ft long, were pictured floating next to Mr Kirkwood’s kayak in the sun-drenched blue waters. Up close: Rupert Kirkwood's son Henry had this encounter with a barrel jellyfish near Hope Cove off the coast of south Devon . The species are usually found in more tropical areas such as the Mediterranean Sea. But the rising temperatures and warmer seas have meant more plankton is available - and the jellyfish have headed closer to shore. The dustbin lid-shaped species is harmless to humans but with the weather warming up experts say more could be heading our way. Beachgoers are advised not to touch jellyfish in case they have chanced upon a species with a powerful sting. Floating: The dustbin lid-shaped species is harmless to humans but with the weather warming up experts say more could be heading our way . The Red Cross says that anyone who does get stung should not try to use urine to provide relief as the healing properties of this are an urban myth. Vinegar is said to be far more effective. Vet Mr Kirkwood said: ‘No doubt they [are] encouraged to put in an appearance by the sunny weather. ‘I have never seen them so early in the year.

"Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini is braced for a ferocious derby clash at Old Trafford this weekend. The fading Barclays Premier League champions take on Manchester United on Sunday having unexpectedly fallen behind their arch-rivals in the table. For most of the season City, if not looking like mounting the strongest of title defences, at least seemed destined for a top-two finish. Manuel Pellegrini is relishing the prospect of taking on Manchester United with Manchester City on Sunday . David Silva (centre) leaves the pitch looking despondent after City's 2-1 loss to Crystal Palace on Monday . Sergio Aguero (centre) is blocked out by Damien Delaney (left) and James McArthur of Palace . That is now far from certain following a dramatic slump in fortunes while United, ordinary for much of the campaign, appear to have clicked into gear in the last month. With just a point separating them in third and fourth, the stage is set for a battle of high intensity. Pellegrini said: 'It is difficult to have a more intense match than you have in the Premier League every week but of course you add a little bit more for a derby of the city. Both teams want to win. 'It is important to be the winning team in the city - that gives an extra plus for the game, not only intensity is better but quality. 'Both teams have very good players and both managers like to play an attacking system so I hope (for a good game for) the fans, for whom you play, and after that I hope we can win.' City have held the edge over United in recent contests and could register a fifth successive derby win for the first time in their history with victory this weekend. A win would also see them become the first club to beat United five times in a row in the Premier League. United had the last laugh over City after the first of their current sequence of derby wins by winning the league in 2013 but since then the blues have had the bragging rights. Pellegrini said: 'I think that they have a lot of respect for our team because last year it was the team that dominated not only the derby but I think we dominated also the Premier League. It is not easy for a team. 'In the last three years we won two and in the other we were runner-up. This year we have been runner-up the whole year. 'We have to play seven games more and we will see what happens at the end of the season and in which position we will stay, but I think for them, they must try to beat the team that has been better in the last few years.' City are likely to come up against an altogether different opponent than the Crystal Palace side that frustrated them last Monday. Louis van Gaal's United have been fluid of late, winning impressively against Tottenham, Liverpool and Aston Villa to take their run of victories to five. Facing a side that is not inclined to sit back could suit City but Pellegrini is dismissive of suggestions that might make it easier than in their most recent away losses at Palace and Burnley. The Chilean said: 'You never know but I don't think it will be easy. It will be different. 'United are a big team that like to play - especially with Van Gaal. He's always an attacking manager. We hope we will see a good game. 'We have a different problem, we have to make sure we don't make mistakes because they have important and technically very good players.' Despite a wretched run of just four league wins in 11 games since pulling level at the top with Chelsea on New Year's Day, Pellegrini maintains all possibilities remain open to his side. City boss Pellegrini remains positive about City's achievements this season despite dropping down to fourth . Vincent Kompany is an injury doubt for Manchester City's clash against Manchester United on Sunday . 'I never think in a negative way,' said the 61-year-old, who will await the outcome of a fitness test on captain Vincent Kompany's hamstring injury. 'I don't think of one, two or three points difference when you have to play seven games. 'When you have mathematical options in football you must never give up and always believe you can do it.'","Manchester City are in fourth, a point behind rivals Manchester United .

"Given the inexorable march of the past 12 months in one direction, perhaps it is only appropriate that Rory McIlroy should spend the eve of the Masters on Wednesday with a member of the celebrated boy band of that name. But it is not lookalike Harry Styles who will carry the Northern Irishman's bag in the par-three tournament but keen golfer Niall Horan as McIlroy looks for a little light relief before his first attempt to complete a career Grand Slam. One Direction released their debut album in 2011, the same year McIlroy won his first major, so you could say they have mirrored each other, hit for greatest hit. Rory McIlroy watches a tee shot during a practice round prior to the start of the 2015 Masters Tournament . McIlroy alongside his caddie Caroline Wozniacki during the 2014 Par 3 Contest  in Augusta . McIlroy celebrates with his  Wozniacki on the 9th hole during  the Par 3 contest at Augusta National Golf Club . At last year's Masters, McIlroy piqued the interest of one or two photographers when then fiancee Caroline Wozniacki donned the caddie's famous white boiler suit. He might find the curiosity levels are even greater this time, for One Direction are even more popular in the US than in Britain. Between them, Niall, an honorary member at Mullingar, Westmeath, and Rory might do more to stir up interest in golf among the young than any number of 'old fogey' initiatives. 'We met in Australia at the end of last year and he was saying he had never been to The Masters,' said McIlroy. 'I said if you're available on the Wednesday you're more than welcome to carry the bag. Niall's really excited.' Niall Horan will swap girls screams for Augusta greens as he caddies for golfer McIlroy . McIlroy hits a putt in the rain during a practice round prior to the start of the 2015 Masters Tournament . McIlroy looked more subdued than excited at his press conference yesterday, possibly because he knew what was coming. On the one hand, he feels as ready as he ever will for his tilt at history. On the other, he had to spend 30 minutes with journalists wanting to trawl over his poor record at Augusta. Here is a sample: Why is your record so bad on the par fives, Rory? Why have you never birdied either the first or the 10th holes? Why have you left here for the past five years with at least one 77 on your score card? What the hell's wrong given all the advantages offered by your length off the tee? McIlroy  walks over the Nelson Bridge with caddie J.P. Fitzgerald during a practice round . To be fair, he answered them all with politeness. After all, there was nothing there he had not analysed and dissected countless times himself. McIlroy knows better than anyone he has no chance unless he does better on the long holes. He brought up the point raised in the Sportsmail graphic from last Saturday, which compared his record on the par fives last year with that of winner Bubba Watson. 'Just look at the two par fives on the back nine on Sunday,' he said. 'I had a nine iron in my hand for my second shot on both and I walked off with two sixes. Two fours I'd have finished third. McIlroy waits under an umbrella during a practice round prior to the start of the 2015 Masters Tournament . 'It's something I've been thinking about a lot. Look at Bubba, who played them in eight-under for the week to my level par and beat me by eight shots. 'I've just been too aggressive at times. I had four sixes on par-fives last year, so if I can clean up those, I'll have a chance to win.' As for those 77s, he said: 'It's not like I'm having a bad 18 holes. It's always just a bad nine holes that causes the damage and it's usually on a Friday, like last year. But I am better equipped now to handle it if things don't go right way. Mentally, I'm in a far better place.' McIlroy conceded that the circus surrounding Tiger Woods's return had not been unhelpful and the draw has worked out pretty well, too. The place you do not want to be come Thursday is in one of the last two groups, like Woods, but McIlroy has been treated kindly, with a mid-morning threesome alongside Americans Phil Mickelson and Ryan Moore. 'I don't think I've played alongside Phil at Augusta so that's perfect,' he said. 'We always get along well and he has a great record here. It will be fun to watch him.' It was this time last week, while practising in Florida, that McIlroy pronounced himself ready to go. 'It's been great not to have to think of anything technical while I'm playing,' he said. 'I've been able to enjoy the build-up.' Rory McIlroy waits with his caddie Fitzgerald in the rain during a practice round  at Augusta National Golf Club . Asked who he saw as favourite, McIlroy went for Bubba — ironic given a recent ESPN survey among the pros ranked Watson as the least favourite. 'I take it as I need to improve as a man,' said Watson, with the sort of annoying comment that explains his unpopularity in the first place. As for McIlroy, he knows where he needs to improve. 'You look at this course and it should fit me perfectly from tee to green,' he said. After One Direction on Wednesday, it'll be his turn to generate some roars.","One Direction star Niall Horan will caddie for Rory McIlroy on Wednesday .

"Dele Alli has set his sights on the Toulon Tournament with England Under 20s as he aims to cap a season that will live long in his memory. The 19-year-old's impressive performances for Milton Keynes Dons earned him a dream move to the Premier League with Tottenham Hotspur in a £5million deal rubber-stamped in January. Loaned back to the Dons for the remainder of the season, Alli's 14 goals have helped keep them in touch with the automatic promotion places in League One. Dele Alli has set his sights on playing for England Under 20s at the Toulon Tournament next month . Dele ALli has impressed for MK Dons this season leading to Tottenham signing him for £5m in January . Alli laid on two assists for team-mate Carl Baker during the Dons' 3-0 home win over Doncaster Rovers on Tuesday night, a result that leaves them a point behind second-placed Preston North End with two matches to play. The season has seen progress for Alli on the international scene too, with good performances for Sean O'Driscoll's Under 19 team. His absence through an ankle injury was a big blow as the team failed to qualify for the Under 19 European Championships but Alli could compensate for that by winning a place in Aidy Boothroyd's Under 20 squad for Toulon next month. Alli told The FA.com: 'I'm not going to lie and say it isn't [a target]. You want to do as well as you can. The aim is to eventually get into the first team. Alli keeps his eyes on the ball as he shoots  during MK Dons' victory against Doncaster Rovers on Tuesday . Alli was named Football League Young Player of the Year at the Football League Awards last Sunday . 'Obviously the next step to that is the Under 21s and that's the aim for me to try and break into that squad or the Under 20s. 'I really enjoyed playing for the Under 19s last year, especially with the team we had and the manager. 'We played a real attractive game, and we liked to play football and that is what I'm used to so it wasn't like I was going away and playing a whole new story. 'I've really enjoyed it and obviously my aim is to eventually get into the seniors. So any age group I play in, the better for me. 'The aim next year for me is to play at the highest level I can for England.' Alli poses alongside FA chairman Greg Dyke (left) at the Awards in London on Sunday night . England have been drawn in Group B of the Toulon Tournament with China, Ivory Coast, Mexico and Morocco. They begin their campaign against Morocco on May 28. His influential performance against Doncaster continued another good week for the midfielder, who was voted Young Player of the Year at the Football League Awards on Sunday night. 'It was a real honour to win it - especially with the players I was up against in Patrick [Bamford of Middlesbrough] and Nathan Redmond [of Norwich]. 'They're great players, and from playing with Patrick last season [during his loan spell at MK Dons], I know just how good he is, so it was a great honour and achievement for me.

"That's not a light lunch, it's just bad lighting, say administrators at a Virginia School standing up for their FLOTUS approved school meals. A concerned mother took a photo of her child's lunch consisting of a dull looking fish fillet, a whole wheat bun, and corn and then posted it to social media this week. Virginia’s Portsmouth Public Schools say that their lunches are in compliance with Michelle Obama's federal lunch rules. Scroll down for video . Look appetizing?: A corned mother took a photo of her child's lunch, a dull looking fish fillet, a whole wheat bun, and corn and then posted it to social media this week . Reasoning: Virginia’s Portsmouth Public Schools say that their lunches are in compliance with Michelle Obama's federal lunch rules . After the photo began circulating the web, Food Service Coordinator Jim Gehlhoff said the lunch was 'concerning' but that it may not actually be as bad as it looks, reports EAG News. 'Poor lighting and food presentation make this lunch unappealing,' he said in a statement released to the media. 'The meal in this photo and other meals served by Portsmouth Public Schools meet nutritional and USDA requirements,' said Gelhoff. According to the school district's lunch menu from their website, Tuesday’s lunch options included spicy Cajun fish with brown rice, a cold cut turkey sandwich, a chef's salad, fresh orange or canned fruit, and 1 per cent skim milk. Wavy took a poll asking people if the though the lunch seemed acceptable and 92.3 per cent of people who voted didn't believe that the lunch looked palatable. 'No child should go to school hungry – it’s that simple,' committee chair Rep. John Kline said at a House Education and Workforce Committee this week. 'Today’s discussion is not about whether we agree on this basic principle; I am confident we all do. Instead, our discussion today is about beginning a larger effort we will continue in the coming months to ensure the best policies are in place to help reach this goal,' he continued. Another paltry lunch: This lunch posted in October shows another American student's dissatisfaction with the school meal . Squeamish: This school lunch allegedly shows a maggot found in a child's green beans . The School Nutrition association doesn’t think Michelle Obama's lunch regulations are to blame but they think a funding increase is needed for the National School Lunch Program. ‘That will help school food authorities afford the foods that we must serve, but unfortunately that won’t make students consume it,’ SNA President Julia Bauscher said during testimony. ‘And that’s what we’re also focused on…finding ways to ensure students will eat the healthy foods that we’re making available to them and not throw it in the trash.’ Two months ago Michelle Obama again came under fire for the 'shortcomings' of her Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act scheme.

"If you struggle to get your child to go to school in the morning, don’t blame them - it could be your fault. Our willingness to learn - or lack thereof - is significantly influenced by our genes, according to a large study. The researchers found that 40 to 50 per cent of the differences in children’s motivation to learn could be explained by their genetic inheritance from their parents. Our willingness to learn is significantly influence by our genes, according to a study by Goldsmiths University in London and Ohio State University. More than 13,000 twins aged nine to 16 took part in the research (stock image shown) Psychologists from Goldsmiths University of London, and Ohio State University in the US studied more than 13,000 twins aged nine to 16 from six countries, including the UK, Canada, Japan, Germany, Russia and the US. The researchers said they were surprised by the results, believing that the twins’ shared environment - elements such as the teachers and the family that they had in common - would be a larger factor than genetics. Instead, genetics and non-shared-environment factors had the largest effect on the children’s motivation to learn, whereas the shared environment had negligible impact. Genetics and non-shared-environment factors were found to have the largest effect on the children’s motivation to learn, whereas the shared environment had negligible impact (stock image shown) A review of 308 studies involving more than 1.1 million children has now completely overturned this long-held stereotype. The study, which looked at data from 1914 to 2011, suggests that girls do better in school than boys - and have been doing so for at least 100 years. The research also claims that girls do better at all ages, in all subjects and all over the world. According to the data, compiled by the University of New Brunswick in Canada, girls have been outperforming boys throughout their academic careers, from infant school to secondary school. Accordingly, we should not jump to conclusions that a poor teacher or the child themselves is to blame for a lack of motivation in the classroom, the researchers said. ‘We had pretty consistent findings across these different countries with their different educational systems and different cultures,’ said Professor Stephen Petrill, of Ohio State University. ‘It was surprising. The knee-jerk reaction is to say someone is not properly motivating the student, or the child himself is responsible. ‘We found that there are personality differences that people inherit that have a major impact on motivation. ‘That doesn’t mean we don’t try to encourage and inspire students, but we have to deal with the reality of why they are different.’ The results don’t mean there is a specific gene for how much children enjoy learning, he added, but they suggest a complex process, involving many genes and gene-environment interactions that help influence a child’s motivation to learn. The study will be published in the journal Personality and Individual Differences.","Willingness to learn is significantly influence by our genes .

"Ethel Rider, who has severe dementia, fell from her bed at the Half Acre Care Home in Radcliffe, when she was being turned to prevent bed sores . Two care home workers who left a mute dementia patient in agony after she fell on the floor, then lied about what had happened, have been jailed. Ethel Rider, 87, suffered a broken pelvis and was left ‘cowering’ in pain after falling from her bed. But even though the grandmother was in agony, her carers failed to seek medical help and simply lifted her back into bed. Because she is mute, Mrs Rider was unable to tell anyone what had happened. It was only 24 hours later that a nurse realised she was in agonising pain and called an ambulance. The injury occurred because one of her carers, Susan Logan, had tried to turn her by herself – against the proper procedure at the private home. But when asked what had happened, Logan and her supervisor, Lauren Gillies, lied, saying Mrs Rider had fallen out of bed. Yesterday both were beginning six-month prison sentences after a judge branded them ‘idle’, saying they had cut corners to give themselves longer breaks. Afterwards the pensioner’s family slammed the carers’ ‘disgusting’ betrayal and said they were pleased both had been jailed. The Daily Mail’s Dignity for the Elderly campaign has repeatedly highlighted examples of poor care in residential homes and on NHS wards. Mrs Rider, a retired factory worker, moved into the Half Acre Care Home in Radcliffe, near Manchester, where staff working in pairs were meant to turn her in bed every two hours. But on May 19 last year, Logan, 59, was trying to turn Mrs Rider by herself when the pensioner fell out of bed. Bolton Crown Court heard how it may have been some time before the emergency alarm was called and Gillies, 25, arrived to find the grandmother in pain and on the floor. ‘She was left on the floor for 40 minutes,’ said Jonathan Turner, prosecuting. ‘She was then hoisted back into the bed. No ambulance was called and the story was devised between the two of them.’ The court heard how Mrs Rider, who now has the mental capacity of a baby, is mute and would have been unable to convey the pain of being hoisted back into bed with a broken pelvis. Care workers Lauren Gillies, 25 (left) and Susan Logan, 59, (right) have been jailed for six months each . Logan, of Radcliffe, and Gillies, of Ramsbottom, admitted wilful neglect. Judge Timothy Stead told them: ‘What you did between the two of you was outrageous. Your decisions have been described as stupid, but I would use a stronger word. They were criminally wrong.’ Mrs Rider’s daughter Julie Murphy, 52, from Radcliffe, said: ‘I am satisfied they have been jailed. What they did is disgusting.’ Four Seasons Health Care, which runs the home, said: ‘We are very sorry for the distress caused to Mrs Rider and her family as a result of the actions of the carers.’ A spokesman for the care home said they were 'very sorry for the distress caused to Mrs Rider and her family'","Ethel Rider, 87, dropped from her bed at Half Acre Care Home in Radcliffe .

"The 'battle of Holland' was nothing short of sensational as Raymond van Barnevald defeated World No 1 Michael van Gerwen - earning the bragging rights and giving himself a fighting chance of qualifying for the showdown at the 02 Arena. Robin van Persie was an interested spectator as he watched the bout on a camel TV and showed his support for his fellow Dutchmen on his Instagram page. The reigning Premier League Darts champion started well and found himself 2-0 up, before Van Gerwen began to score high and leveled the legs up. Raymond van Barneveld was in formidable form as he won 'the battle of Holland' against Michael van Gerwen . But Van Barneveld lived up to his legendary status, with scintillating finishing to ease past his Dutch counterpart, 7-3, and end his previously unbeaten record.

Robin van Persie took to Instagram to show that he was watching his fellow Dutchmen go head-to-head . The Manchester United forward is currently out injured but looks set to leave Louis van Gaal's side . Bunting and Taylor were involved in arguably the match of the night, with both men involved in a quite incredible ending, where they threw a sequence of wayward darts before Bunting hit double one and making sure he took home a point. Adrian Lewis won his third match on the bounce, beating Bunting, 7-2, and condemning his opponent to a heavy defeat. 'Jackpot' boosted his chances of making the knockout stage with a convincing victory as he proved why he's still a player to fear in the Premier League.

Gary Anderson produced a sterling fightback to earn himself a draw against James Wade - sending the Scottish crowd wild as he hit double 20 to level it at 6-6. Wade had a number of chances to finish off the tie but was out of sorts in the final four legs, giving the 'Flying Scotsman' a glimmer hope - and he made no mistake.

"An Oregon lawmaker proposed legislation Monday creating uniform standards for hand dryers in public restrooms. The bill says that the recent proliferation of powerful dryers is efficient, but can sometimes trigger ringing of in the ears, or cause discomfort for people with development or sensory disabilities. The measure would require all new or replacement dryers to operate at a noise level no louder than 84 decibels. According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that is about as loud as a school cafeteria. A measure proposed to the Oregon legislature would require all new or replacement dryers to operate at a noise level no louder than 84 decibels, about as loud as a school cafeteria. (File photo) It also wouldn't allow hand dryers blowing air downwards to blow air faster than 115 mph, in case the hand-dryer manufacturer doesn't label the decibel level. Bill sponsor Democratic Sen. Chris Edwards told the Senate Committee on Business and Transportation that the new generation of hand dryers used to elicit episodes in his autistic son, who would cry and cover his ears when he heard them. It's not the hand-dryer motor that's too loud, Edwards said, it's the 'air knife' against the hand that can cause a sharp, shrill sound. 'I almost didn't bring this bill because this is not the most consequential bill of the legislative session. We all know that,' Edwards said. Democratic Senator Chris Edwards (left) sponsored the bill after his autistic son had episodes after hearing loud hand dryers. Republican senator Chuck Thomsen (right) says he prefers paper hand drying . 'But nonetheless there are those of us that just find these hand dryers to be extraordinarily obnoxious and disruptive to family members.' The bill would also 'requires downward blowing hand dryer to not blow air at an air velocity that exceeds 115 miles per hour'. High-speed, efficient new hand dryers, such as the Dyson Airblade or the Excel Xlerator, are fast replacing the old models, which often left hands still dripping wet. Still, there are some who would prefer if hand dryers were a thing of the past altogether. 'The new ones are faster, but I still would ban them all and go back to paper,' said Republican Sen. Chuck Thomsen of Hood River. The bill, SB 488, is scheduled for a hearing on Wednesday.","Bill would require all new dryers to be no louder than 84 decibels .

"Floyd Mayweather has taken a very public swipe at his 'haters' ahead of his fight-of-the-century bout with Manny Pacquiao next month. The 38-year-old boxer has shared a video flaunting his diamond-encrusted watches, fleet of super-cars and carpets of cash on his Instagram account.

The video then cuts to rows of luxurious Rolex watches adorned with jewels and Mayweather standing proudly in front of his Las Vegas mansion. A few seconds of the video even show four half-naked women twerking, supposedly for the boxer's pleasure. It surfaces just two weeks before one of the most anticipated fights in recent boxing history, when he takes on eight-division champion Manny Pacquiao. With the two fighters' management teams and the hosts MGM Grand locked in a stand-off between ticket allocations, they have yet to go on public sale.

'Normally there's a public sale 10 weeks before the fight,' according to Connor Gregoire, an analyst for SeatGeek. He added: 'It is bizarre... To our knowledge no one has a printed ticket in their hands right now.' Tickets for the fight were expected to cost between £1,000 and £5,000 in the 16,500-seat Grand Garden arena in the Las Vegas Casino. But those prices have incredibly tripled in the resale market before they have even gone on public sale. Mayweather's promoter said that tickets would go on sale this week for the May 2 fight but MGM Grand's officials have been tight-lipped about their availability.

Meanwhile Pacquiao's manager blamed the opposing fighter's camp for holding up the ticket sales, claiming they refused to sign an agreement drawn up months ago. Michael Koncz said: 'It's a real mess right now... I can only surmise the motivation is greed and an attempt to manipulate the tickets, otherwise why the hold up?

"Hit rap trio Migos have been arrested on the first leg of their U.S. tour after police discovered drugs and guns inside their van during a college gig. Rappers Quavious Marshall, 24, Kirschnick Ball, 20, and Kiari Cephus, 23, were escorted off the Georgia Southern University campus mid-performance on Saturday night and taken into custody. According to NBC News, all of the band members have been denied bond - meaning they might not be able to fulfill their upcoming tour dates. Migos were next due to perform at the Ksu Convocation Center in Georgia before traveling on to a number of other states including Wisconsin, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania and New York. From left to right: Hip hop rappers Quavious Marshall, 24,  Kirschnick Ball, 20, and Kiari Cephus, 23, have been arrested on the first leg of their U.S. tour after drugs and guns were found in their van . Authorities said that they suspected the music stars were in possession of drugs when 'a very potent smell' of marijuana was detected coming from their two tour buses. When Migos left to perform at Georgia Southern University's Hanner Fieldhouse arena over the weekend, investigators seized the opportunity to conduct a search. Multiple guns, marijuana and another undisclosed drug were discovered inside the vehicles,  officials said. They added that the discoveries 'were intensely concerning' as they had been brought to a university-sponsored event where over a thousand students were congregated. In the spotlight: According to NBC News, all of the band members have been denied bond - meaning they might not fulfill their upcoming tour dates . Bad habits? Migos pose with friends for a group photo, posted to social media . The three band members - best known for their 2013 single Versace and their 2014 track Fight Night - were arrested after leaving the stage. They reportedly face charges of drug possession; possession of firearms in a school safety zone; and possession of firearms during the commission of a crime. It wasn't known early Monday if they had attorneys. Phone calls and emails to the group's management team by the Associated Press were not immediately returned. About a dozen other suspects - all occupants of the two vans - were also taken into custody following the concert. Information about them and the charges they face were not immediately available. The arrests took place during the school's annual spring concert. Migos - which formed as a group in 2009 - had contracted with Georgia Southern to perform at the event, the sheriff's office said.","Quavious Marshall, 24, Kirschnick Ball, 20, and Kiari Cephus, 23, were escorted off the Georgia Southern University campus  on Saturday night .

"(CNN)Ever had a headache so big, you felt like drilling a hole in your head to let the pain out? In Neolithic times trepanation -- or drilling a hole into the skull -- was thought to be a cure for everything from epilepsy to migraines. It could even have been a form of emergency surgery for battle wounds. But while there is still conjecture about the real reasons behind the mysterious procedure, what is known is that the implement often used to carry out the primitive surgery was made from one of the sharpest substances found in nature -- obsidian. Obsidian -- a type of volcanic glass -- can produce cutting edges many times finer than even the best steel scalpels. At 30 angstroms -- a unit of measurement equal to one hundred millionth of a centimeter -- an obsidian scalpel can rival diamond in the fineness of its edge. When you consider that most household razor blades are 300-600 angstroms, obsidian can still cut it with the sharpest materials nano-technology can produce. Even today, a small number of surgeons are using an ancient technology to carry out fine incisions that they say heal with minimal scarring. Dr. Lee Green, professor and chair of the Department of Family Medicine at the University of Alberta, says he routinely uses obsidian blades. ""The biggest advantage with obsidian is that it is the sharpest edge there is, it causes very little trauma to tissue, it heals faster and more importantly it heals with less scarring,"" he said. ""It makes for the best cosmetic outcome."" He explained that steel scalpels at a microscopic level have a rough cutting edge that tears into tissue, a function of the crystals that make up the metal. Obsidian, meanwhile, cleaves into a fine and continuous edge when properly cut. Dr. Green said he once helped documentary makers produce a program on surgical technology in ancient Egyptian, setting up a blind test on the cutting power of obsidian. Using cultured-skin burn dressing, a substance composed of skin cells, he made an incision with a modern scalpel and a parallel incision with an obsidian scalpel. The host of the program was then invited to look at the cuts under a video microscope and tell the difference. ""It wasn't hard to tell the difference at all -- as soon as he turned around everyone in the studio was like 'Ohhh',"" Dr. Green said. ""Under the microscope you could see the obsidian scalpel had divided individual cells in half, and next to it the steel scalpel incision looked like it had been made by a chainsaw."" Modern obsidian scalpels look nothing like the decorative flint-knapped knives of Neolithic man, often resembling their modern counterparts in everything except for the blade edge, but Dr. Green said they are a very different animal. ""The feel is very different because obsidian has no 'bite,'"" he said. ""If you look under the microscope at a steel scalpel edge it looks almost like a saw, it has teeth, whereas obsidian is smooth even microscopically. ""It's a very different feel to work with and you have to practice before you start using it in surgery. ""You also have to be careful not to nick yourself with it because you don't even feel it!"" And Dr. Green believes incisions made with these blades heal faster. He said a colleague who needed a mole removed agreed to undergo an experiment where half the procedure was carried out with an obsidian scalpel and the other half was removed with steel. ""What's really fun is seeing it heal,"" he said. ""Four weeks later the difference was quite remarkable -- there was very much a difference in scarring."" In Germany, the manufacturer Fine Science Tools produces obsidian scalpels which can be used in situations where the patient may have an allergy to steel or metal. ""For studies where trace metals from ordinary scalpel blades cannot be tolerated, these very special obsidian scalpels may provide the answer,"" the company says. At €99 per scalpel ($107.40), they represent a considerable saving on their diamond cousins which the company prices at €712.50 ($772.60). But there has been little academic research into the efficacy of obsidian blades compared to steel scalpels, and they do have disadvantages: Obsidian scalpels are not Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved, and they are extremely brittle and prone to breaking if lateral forces are applied -- meaning they are unlikely to ever be in widespread use. Dr. Green, whose scalpels were manufactured for him by an expert flint-knapper and archaeologist Errett Callahan, concedes the Stone Age scalpels are not for everyone. ""If it was let loose on the market there'd be far too many injuries from it,"" he said. ""It's very fragile and it's very easy to break pieces off.""","Obsidian can produce cutting edges many times finer than even the best steel scalpels .

"Ed Balls has been accused of treating the public with 'contempt' after dismissing as a 'joke' the infamous Labour note admitting the party had blown the nation's finances. The shadow chancellor said the letter, left in the Treasury by the former Labour minister Liam Byrne in 2010, was just a 'jokey note'. Mr Byrne's glib note to his successor as Treasury Secretary stated: 'Dear Chief Secretary, I'm afraid there is no money. Kind regards – and good luck! Liam.' Scroll down for video . Damaging: Labour's Liam Byrne sent left this handwritten note to his successor before he left the Treasury in 2010 . The note has become emblematic of Labour's fiscal irresponsibility in office and was used by David Cameron in the seven-way leaders' debate earlier this month. When the Coalition took office in 2010 the budget deficit had reached more than £150billion – more than 10 per cent of the entire size of the economy. But Mr Ball insisted the note admitting that Labour had blown the nation's finances should not be taken seriously. He told BBC West Midlands: 'Liam Byrne's note was a jokey note… of the course the money hadn't run out.' Mr Balls said Labour would cut the deficit – still running at £90billion a year – every year. He said: 'Nothing in our manifesto is going to require additional borrowing. I think in tough times, people want a government which will make tough decisions, and will make the sums add up, and that is what we're saying very clearly today.' But he was asked if Labour was 'credible' and could be trusted with the economy. Mr Balls said: 'I think people want to know the sums add up. People know that the global financial crisis wasn't caused by Labour's spending – it wasn't Labour's spending on nurses and doctors which meant the Lehman Brothers investment bank went bankrupt in New York. 'Liam Byrne's note was a jokey note, of course the money hadn't run out.' Ed Balls, pictured in Birmingham today, said the letter, left in the Treasury by the former Labour minister Liam Byrne in 2010, was just a 'jokey note' Mr Balls blamed the Lib Dem minister David Laws for leaking the note. He said it was supposed to be a private note, adding: 'It was supposed to be a piece of humour. In fact, in that year, the government spend hundreds of billions of pounds, so of course the money hadn't run out, but there was a large deficit, and we had to get it down, and we needed to get it down in a fair way. 'The reason why we're more credible than the Tories now is that they're not people who understand the need for change in the economy, it's not been all in it together, they've not even balanced the books – it's going to take a Labour government to do it.' Former Treasury Secretary Liam Byrne left the note to his successor David Laws in 2010 . The Tories this morning slammed Mr Balls's remarks – claiming they showed that he had not learnt the lessons from the great economic crash. Treasury minister David Gauke said: 'The fact that Ed Balls thinks the debt they left the country was a 'joke' goes to show the contempt they hold the public in. 'It is clear Labour has not learnt the lessons of the past and would do the same all over again - more taxes, more borrowing and more debt.' The letter has haunted Labour for years, allowing Tory and Liberal Democrat ministers to prove the nation's coffers were empty. The letter consisting of just 18 words it offers no apology or justification for the state of the nation's finances, only a glib 'good luck' to whoever was left to clear up the economic mess. Written in blue ink on government note paper, it was opened by Lib Dem David Laws who became Chief Secretary to the Treasury when the coalition was formed. Lib Dem Mr Laws said: 'He left a note which frankly does sum up precisely the state of the Treasury when he left it. I think it is refreshing that a Labour politician has been prepared to admit that.' Mr Byrne has admitted he will regret it for the rest of his life. He said: 'It was a very foolish thing to do. 'I suppose I did think there was a convention amongst honourable members that private correspondence would stay private. 'There's obviously a very old tradition of these notes that goes back to the 1930s. I felt disappointed that some very old conventions had been cast aside for political advantage.'","Letter was left in the Treasury by the former minister Liam Byrne in 2010 .

"Stock market returns have averaged 16 per cent a year under David Cameron's Conservatives party, compared to just under nine per cent under Labour . Shares have performed nearly twice as well under Conservative governments than under Labour over the last 45 years, according to figures published today. Stock market returns have averaged 16 per cent a year under the Tories compared with just under 9 per cent under Labour and just over 9 per cent under the current Coalition. The figures, in an analysis for the Daily Mail by investment company Hargreaves Lansdown, are a further boost for David Cameron and George Osborne ahead of the general election on May 7. Ed Miliband is struggling to win over business men and women as well as investors who are worried about a Left-wing Labour government’s attitudes to enterprise. A survey of FTSE 100 bosses this weekend showed 70 per cent believe a Labour government under Mr Miliband would be a ‘catastrophe’ for the economy. The analysis by Hargreaves Lansdown shows investors – including millions of workers saving for a pension – fare better under the Conservatives. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ‘The stock market has performed twice as well under a Conservative government as it has under Labour, according to performance statistics dating back to 1970.’ The analysis shows that companies have also performed better under the Tories with profits up by an average of 11 per cent a year under the Conservatives and 6 per cent under Labour. Writing in the Daily Mail, Mr Khalaf said: ‘Over the last 45 years there have been five Conservative governments, five Labour governments, and the current Coalition. ‘Over that time the UK stock market has returned on average 16 per cent a year under Conservative rule, compared with 9 per cent under Labour. ‘Markets can be capricious beasts in the short term, but on average this trend reflects the growth in UK company profits under the two parties.’ However, he said events on the global stage ‘are far more important to the UK stock market than the next resident of Number 10’. He added: ‘Looking back over the last 45 years, the waxing and waning of the stock market has been driven in large part by overseas influences, and is not commanded from Westminster. This makes sense when you consider how globalised most industries are.’ Experts have warned that a hung parliament could send financial markets into a tailspin and the pound and shares crashing. A survey of FTSE 100 bosses  showed 70 per cent believe a Labour government  would be a ‘catastrophe’ for the economy. The analysis by Hargreaves Lansdown shows investors fare better under the Conservatives . All the major pollsters are predicting that no party will win an overall majority. George Buckley, UK economist at Deutsche Bank, said: ‘The 2015 UK general election is set to be the most unpredictable for nearly a century. ‘Polls suggest that neither of the two major parties may have sufficient support to secure an outright majority. ‘There may be no good outcome for investors.’ A hard-hitting report by BlackRock, the largest fund manager in the world, said ‘a soothing outcome for the markets is hard to imagine’ given Labour’s anti-business policies and Tory plans to hold a referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union. ‘Labour would be tough on business – and might be perceived as lacking fiscal responsibility,’ the US giant said in the report. ‘A Conservatives-dominated Cabinet would pave the way for an unsettling referendum in 2017 on the UK’s EU membership. ‘Whoever wins – and the result could take some time to emerge – will lead a weak government likely to pass only watered-down legislation.’","Shares have performed nearly twice as well under Tories, new figures show .

"Aaron Hernandez left behind his life as a millionaire star athlete today, swapping a designer suit for a set of gray scrubs at a prison  where he will begin a life sentence for murder. It is perhaps fitting that Hernandez was booked at MCI Cedar Junction in Walpole, a prison just across the freeway from Gillette Stadium where he used to play for the New England Patriots. Hernandez hasn't set foot in the stadium since June 2013, when he was arrested under suspicion of murdering Odin Lloyd, who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fianceé at the time. On Wednesday, a 12-person jury found Hernandez guilty, sentencing him to life in prison without the possibility of parole due to some especially heinous aspects of Lloyd's killing. Scroll down for video . The beginning of the rest of his life: Aaron Hernandez was taken to the MCI Cedar Juntion prison in Walpole, Massachusetts on Wednesday after he was sentenced to life in prison without parole for the 2013 murder of Odin Lloyd. Hernandez circled in red, arriving at the 700-inmate prison . Old neighborhood: Cedar Junction is about a mile and a half away from Gillette Stadium, where Hernandez used to play tight end for the New England Patriots . Nothing to smile about now: Hernandez slumped down in his chair on Wednesday as a guilty verdict was read (left). Pictured on the right during happier times, playing for the Patriots . Hernandez was shocked by the decision, mouthing 'You're wrong', before slumping to his seat - perhaps seeing the riches to rags reality of his new life. Hernandez has vowed to appeal the decision. Directly after court, Hernandez was taken to the 700-inmate facility that will serve as a stark contrast to his former home - a $1.3million mansion. Hernandez arrived at Cedar Junction around 1pm for booking and was given the prison number W106228. The booking process took about two hours, and was probably not the most comfortable of experiences. According to a report by WBUR, new inmates at the facility are taken downstairs into the basement where the intake center is located. It is there that they change into their new uniform of gray scrubs and laceless canvas shoes, turning over their personal clothes to be either incinerated or mailed home. New home: Hernandez is starting his sentence at maximum-security prison MCI Cedar Junction in Walpole, Massachusetts (pictured above) Stately: Before his arrest, Hernandez lived in a $1.3million mansion in North Attleborough, Massachusetts (pictured above . They then post for a new mugshot and are fingerprinted before sitting in a special chair that scans their bodies for possible hidden objects. All new inmates receive a paper bag containing seven pairs of underwear and a specially-designed razor and pen that can't be used as a weapon. Jerry-rigged weapons are something Hernandez should be concerned with, according to Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hogson. Sheriff Hogson spoke with WHDH after the ruling on Wednesday and said that as the focus of a high-profile case, Hernandez will be targeted in the prison. 'It depends how he's classified or where he'll be, but it's always a possibility, always a concern,' Hodgson said. Labor: Workers at Cedar Junction's prison manufacture license plates for 50 cents an hour - a far cry from the $40million contract extension Hernandez received from the Patriots in 2012 . The food at Cedar Junction was described by a Boston Globe reporter as 'marginally edible'. Hernandez pictured above eating chicken after a Patriots game . Some other aspects of prison life may not be up to Hernandez's standards either - such as the 50 cents an hour inmates are paid to manufacture license plates. In 2012, the Patriots extended Hernandez's contract for five years in a $40million deal that was unprecedented for a tight end. Also in 2012, he signed a deal to be a spokesman for shoe brand Puma. And for a former professional athlete who's used to eating large satisfying meals, Hernandez may lose his appetite in the cafeteria where the food was once described by a Boston Globe reporter as 'marginally edible'. Cedar Point is where all male inmates are booked when they start their sentences in Massachusetts, so Hernandez will eventually be moved to another facility in the coming weeks or months, . It's reported that he will be sent to Sousa Baranowski Correctional Center in Shirley, Massachusetts next.

"She's won the London Marathon three times but this weekend Paula Radcliffe says she'll be happy to finish at all regardless of her position. The 41-year-old mother-of-two has battled back from injury to take part in the 26.2 mile race in the capital and a result won't be running with the other female elites but with the masses. She said this week: 'I'm going in unfit and unprepared for a marathon, but I'm hoping my body can remember once it gets out there how it's supposed to do it.' Scroll down for video . Paula Radcliffe finishes the London Marathon on Sunday after running with the masses to bring down the curtain on her professional running career . Paula was delighted she could return to London to run the marathon again . The mother-of-two has won the London Marathon three times, including in 2003 when she set her phenomenal word record time of 2 hours 15 minutes and 25 seconds . 'Unfit' for Paula actually means a time most runners can only dream of, and she's still likely to clock one of the fastest times of the day from a British woman. It will be an emotional run for Paula who will be presented with the the inaugural John Disley Lifetime Achievement award in honour of her achievements, which include setting a still unbeaten world record time of 2 hours 15 minutes and 25 seconds in London in 2003. Her great success over the years has also come with some heartache as she has never won an Olympic medal and often been let down by her body as she's pushed it to her limits. So as she prepares to run the marathon - supposedly for the last time - FEMAIL looks back on the career of the inspirational running super mother... Paula started running for Bedford and County from a young age, left, and won numerous races as a junior before progressing to take the European cross-country in 1998, right . The GB vests kept coming but she missed out on a medal at the Sydney Olympics in 2000 . Paula gave her all at the 2000 Olympics but was out-sprinted in the final moments and finished fourth . Paula's talent for running was evident from a young age and, under the coaching guidance of Alex Stanton at Bedford and County Athletics Club, she became accustomed to winning races on the domestic circuit. By the time she was a teenager, she had pulled on the first of her many Great Britain vests, winning junior races at the World Cross Country Championships and on the track. As a student at Loughborough University, she gained a first-class degree in modern languages while continuing to keep up her training regime. It was as student that she met her husband, Gary Lough - himself a talented middle distance runner - who went on to become her manager and training partner as well as the father of her two children. After leaving university, Paula embarked on her career as a full-time athlete and continued to have success in cross country races and on the track. She again lost out on a medal at the 2001 World Champs - which led to a public spat with husband Gary Lough who shared her disappointment . It was in Edmonton that Paula also made her stance on drugs in sport clear . But at major championships her valiant efforts to win a medal kept resulting in her getting out-sprinted in the home straight. She was fourth in the 5000m at the 1997 World Championships, fifth at the European Championships over 10,000m a year later and then fourth at the Sydney Olympic Games. At the World Championships in Edmonton in 2001 she was determined to make the podium - but after front-running she was again out-kicked in the final lap. This disappointment was her most famous as it led to a very public row with Gary - who criticised her race tactics when many thought he should have been consoling her. Gary was portrayed as a villain in the press - something that hurt the couple deeply. Success came on the track in 2002 as she won gold at the European Champs . She also took the gold in the 2002 Commonwealth Games 5k in front of a home crowd in Manchester . Her popularity soared as she was awarded an MBE in June 2002 and later that year was voted the BBC's Sports Personality of the Year, pictured here holding the coveted trophy . Speaking to the Evening Standard in 2012,  Paula said such heated arguments occur because: 'Gary understands what makes me tick and wants to support me as much as he can to achieve that. 'Sometimes that can cause blow ups - we are both strong-minded individuals but we have always said to each other that we should say what we want all the time. We never sleep on an argument because that is dangerous.' It was also in Edmonton that Paula made a public stand against drugs cheats holding up a banner saying 'EPO cheats out'. She's remained a staunch anti-drugs campaigner throughout her career and has called for tougher testing measures. Despite this, she's also had to face accusations that she couldn't have achieved her marathon World Record clean - as it's a time that hasn't been surpassed in 12 years. She said earlier this year she finds such unfounded accusations 'horrible'. 'I get it all the time. People saying ""she couldn't have run 2.15 clean"" but I know I can be totally proud,' she said. In 2003 she smashed the marathon world record as she won in London . In 2003 her form on the roads continued as she set also world records over 5k and 10k . But at the 2004 Athens Olympics, she was forced to drop out of the race despite being favourite to win . Paula was devastated she couldn't finish the Olympic marathon as her body was depleted by medication she had to take following a collision with a bike in training beforehand . The athlete felt she'd let everyone down and cried at the press conference . 'It makes you think we have to put a system in place that protects clean athletes. There will be some Russians athletes who are not cheating, there are a lot of Kenyan athletes out there who are not cheating and they are all being lumped together. It spoils it so we have to do something to protect them and the sport.' Paula bounced back from the disappointment in Edmonton to have a victorious year in 2002 over all terrain. She won the World Cross Country Championships and the London Marathon and finally took gold medals on the track at the Commonwealth Games and then the European Championships. She bounced back from the Olympic disappointment to take victory at the London Marathon again in 2005 . But the race will be remembered for the toilet stop she took en route . She also won a gold medal at the World Champs in 2005 over the marathon distance . Her popularity soared as she was awarded an MBE in June 2002 and later that year was voted the BBC's Sports Personality of the Year. In 2003 she ran her incredible world record marathon time pushing the pace from start to finish without another competitor in sight. She also set world records over 10k and 5k on the roads in the same year. As a result, in 2004 she went into the Athens Olympics marathon as the firm favourite and hopes were high that she would finally win the gold Olympic medal she deserved. But it was not to be. In training before the race, an collision with a cyclist led to an injury for which she had to take anti-inflammatory medication. The medicine depleted her system but she was determined to still race. However, her weakened body could not take the pace and she was forced to drop out of the race in tears. She later said the time that followed was 'traumatic' as she felt like she'd let the nation down and Gary admitted in ITV4's Sports Life Stories that the media attention almost led to him having 'a nervous breakdown'. The following year her success winning the London Marathon again was overshadowed by the fact she had to stop for a very public loo break on the side of the road. At the press conference afterwards, Paula laughed off the embarrassing incident explaining her need for the toilet was giving her stomach cramps and 'the main thing was to win the race'. Later that year, she won another gold medal in the World Championships over the marathon distance. Paula and Gary moved to Monaco and started a family as daughter Isla was born in January 2007. Less than a year later, Paula was back to winning ways taking victory at the New York Marathon. Daughter Isla was born in 2007 and months later, Paula won the New York marathon . But in 2008, she was disappointed to finish 23rd in the Beijing Olympics as her training was interrupted by injury in the build up. She's pictured here being consoled by friend and fellow GB runner Liz Yelling . Son Raphael was born in 2010 but injury again ruined her attempts to resume her running career . Once again she became an inspiration and proved to other elite female athletes that you can combine motherhood with a successful running career. In 2008, Paula lined up at the Olympics again but injury in the build-up to the race meant she missed vital training and she wasn't fit enough to compete with the best on the day. She finished in 23rd place and was once again upset she couldn't fulfill her potential at the Olympics. Later that year she won the New York marathon and then took another career break to have son Raphael. Since then, she returned to competitive running but was often thwarted by injury causing her to pull out of major competitions. In 2012, Paula had surgery on a long-standing foot problem in the hope it would mean she could run again . The surgery worked and Paula will now return to run the streets of London this weekend . The athlete said she's delighted to be back in the capital and Sunday's race will be 'really special' A foot problem meant running in the London 2012 Olympics was out of the question - in fact doctors were worried she may never run again. She kept up her interest in athletics becoming a commentator for the BBC and supporting grassroots running. Following surgery in 2012, she was relieved to be able to run again and is delighted she can now run the London Marathon again, albeit not at full fitness. She said of Sunday's race: 'I know I am not going to be competitive but to get the chance to take part in this race one more time is something that is really special.'","41-year-old mother-of-two has battled back from injury .

"For a player known for his fearsome, fire-breathing nature in the centre of Arsenal’s midfield, who would protect goal like it was a pot of gold, it is fitting that he is preparing to be a football manager at Dragon Park. Patrick Vieira is set to complete his UEFA Pro Licence this summer leaving Manchester City’s Head of the Elite Development equipped for the top job. He has been taking his coaching badges with the Welsh Football Association under their technical director Osian Roberts. Given Manuel Pellegrini’s capitulation at City, the timing of their conclusion could not be better with Vieira itching for a chance to test himself amongst the best. Patrick Vieira has been part of the coaching team at Manchester City since he retired . Vieira worked as Football Development Executive at City before becoming reserve team manager . Vieira is one of the potential candidates in the frame to replace Manuel Pellegrini - if he were to leave . Under Premier League rules, there is nothing stopping Vieira taking charge now as they allow coaches without the full qualifications to take charge for 12 weeks. There is currently no real hurry, but in the coming months City’s top echelons will have some important decisions to make. Vieira’s contract at City is due to expire this summer and he is not prepared to hang around forever waiting for a chance at the helm. City’s teenagers are in awe of the man, having grown up watching him torment the Premier League for a decade at Arsenal and City and across Europe. Vieira played for Manchester City towards the end of his career after spells at Juventus and Inter Milan . Vieira was signed by former manager Roberto Mancini in 2011 . One of their brightest prospects on loan at Lille, Rony Lopes, told Sportsmail in an interview: ’It was like a dream just to meet someone like Vieira. For him to be the coach, it was the best thing in the world. From the first day, he was always very friendly, talking to me a lot, trying to pass on his knowledge and make me grow up as a player and a person. That was he wanted. He is very important to me. He keeps in touch with me, asking how I am.’ After a poor start to his time in charge of City’s young players they have made it to the UEFA Youth League quarter-finals for two successive seasons, enhancing Vieira’s reputation. Young Portuguese player Rony Lopes spoke highly of Vieira . The Frenchman also has allies in the first team, having played with Vincent Kompany and Joe Hart in his one season at the club in 2010/11. When Vieira joined City in a coaching capacity in June 2013 his aim was to see how he progressed in ‘the next few years,’ suggesting he is coming to a decision-making juncture in his career. He chose the Welsh FA and Roberts, who works alongside his deputy Carl Darlington, to complete his badges because the pair are known for developing individual coaches through their personality. Vieira is best remembered for the nine years he spent at Arsenal . Vieira made his name in England at Arsenal where he won seven major honours . Vieira has his own idea of how he wants to manage a side. ‘My coaching style is a combination from my experience of working with Arsene Wenger, Fabio Capello and Jose Mourinho,’ he told Sportsmail in an interview. ‘There is a little bit of all of them, plus my own experience to deliver my message. The relationship with the players is so important. I want to trust them but they must trust me, too. I like it because I want to be close with them. ‘ . In February he added another stellar manager to his list of influences when he spent time at Bayern Munich with Pep Guardiola and his backroom staff. City’s academy director Mark Allen described how he likes his sides to play: ‘We play out from the back, through the thirds, into midfield and then a possession-based game but with fast, attacking play. We want to keep the ball, have full-backs bombing on and work on a very fast recovery. Press, press, press and play again.'","Patrick Vieira set to complete his UEFA Pro Licence this summer .

"A shrine created in memory of those killed during the Germanwings crash has revealed the first picture of the hero pilot who tried to break into the plane’s cockpit. Staring straight ahead, eyes firmly on the camera, this is the only photograph to have emerged of Patrick Sonderheimer, the pilot of the doomed flight. Yet the shrine, which was erected in memory of the staff killed during the tragedy, controversially also includes a picture of co-pilot Andreas Lubitz. Scroll down for video . A memorial display at Dusseldorf airport has revealed the first photograph of hero captain Patrick Sondheimer left) who tried to break down the cockpit door to stop killer pilot Andreas Lubitz (second from left) from crashing the aircraft . Mr Lubitz is the man who orchestrated the disaster by steering flight 9525, from Barcelona to Dusseldorf, into the mountains killing all of those on board. It has since emerged that Mr Lubitz had carefully planned the attack using the online pseudonym ‘Skydevil’, according to the German newspaper Bild. As the plane plummeted towards ground, Mr Sondheimer, 36, a father-of-two, tried in vain to save the lives of the 144 passengers and five crew members on board. Moments before, he had left the cockpit in the hands of his co-pilot in order to use the bathroom. When he returned, the door was locked and co-pilot Lubitz, 27, ignored desperate pleas from his colleague to let him back in. In a desperate attempt to stop the fatal crash, Mr Sondheimer spent up to five minutes attempting to smash his way into the cockpit using an axe. Mr Sondheimer used an axe to try to break down the door to the cockpit after Lubitz (right) locked him out before accelerating into a mountain . All of the 144 passengers and five crew members died in the crash. Lubitz, 27, had been plotting the disaster online under the name Skydevil . On recordings retrieved from the plane’s black box Mr Sondheimer can be heard shouting: ‘Open the goddam door’ in the moments before his death. The display in memory of the staff who died was created before it was revealed that Mr Lubitz had intentionally crashed the plane in the French Alps on March 24. Alongside the two men, sit the photographs of the other four crew members killed during the tragedy. All four are seen smiling broadly at the camera. The picture was taken at Dusseldorf airport, according to German newspaper Bild am Sonntag. Last night, Mr Sondheimer’s heartbroken mother paid tribute to her ‘hero’ son at her home 15 miles from the German town of Dusseldorf. Mrs Sondheimer said: ‘He died a hero but he still died, and we are devastated. The light has gone out of our lives. I am too upset to say any more.’ Shortly before the crash, Mr Sondheimer, the father of a six-year-old girl and a three-year-old boy, had switched from long-haul to short-haul flights in order to spend more time with his young family. During a memorial on March 29, his grandmother Marianne Sondheimer said her grandson’s lifelong dream was to become a pilot. She said: ‘My grandson is dead and all because of an idiot who did this to his whole flight and killed so many people.’ During the service, Captain Sondheimer was described as a man who ‘radiated happiness’. Black box recordings revealed Mr Sondheimer frantically appealed to Lubitz to open the door as the plane plunged further towards a mountain. He was described as a hero by his family .","Mr Sondheimer frantically tried to break down cockpit door before crash .

"Kingsley Burrell, 29, died in police custody on March 31 2011, four days after he was arrested and sectioned in Birmingham city centre . A mentally ill father-of-three who died in police custody was handcuffed for six hours, wet himself after being denied access to a toilet, and was repeatedly punched by officers, it was claimed today. Kingsley Burrell, 29, was taken into custody on March 27 2011 after calling police to say he was being threatened with a gun while out shopping in the centre of Birmingham, a court has heard. However, when CCTV showed that in fact nobody had approached him, he was sectioned under the Mental Health Act, and died four days later at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital (QE). An inquest into his death at Birmingham Coroner's Court heard that he was arrested in the Haymer corner shop in Winson Green while he was going swimming with his son, four, and niece. Trainee security guard Mr Burrell called police himself, saying two men had threatened to shoot him, but when they arrived he was handcuffed and taken to the QE hospital. Today, Kadisha Brown-Burrell, the victim's sister, described the moment she saw Mr Burrell following his arrest. She said: 'When he walked out he walked over stiff. He couldn’t move his head, couldn’t move his body, couldn’t move his shoulders. 'Kingsley had three lumps, one on his forehead. I said to Chantelle, ""Take a picture of that"". 'Kingsley said to me, ""I can’t move"". He couldn’t move the upper part of his body. He was barefoot and had pyjama bottoms on. 'I could see that he was really upset, saying, ""How can they put me in here knowing I was calling for help because there were a couple of guys after me?""' When she and Mr Burrell's partner Chantelle Graham returned to see him the following day, he told them he had been handcuffed for a number of hours after being taken to the hospital. Ms Brown-Burrell said: 'He said that while he was in the QE during assessment he was on the floor, and all he wanted was a glass of water. Mr Burrell was taken into custody after calling officers and claiming three men had threatened him with a machine gun. When CCTV showed that nobody had approached Mr Burrell, he was sectioned . Today an inquest into Mr Burrell's death was told his claims that police beat him, and left him handcuffed for six hours  pictured left to right, his family Janet Burrell, Lorraine Burell and Kadisha Burrell) 'They had made him incontinent and he had wet himself. He was on the floor for five or six hours and all he wanted was water and for them to release the cuffs.' Mr Burrell told her a police officer had offered to loosen the cuffs for him, but 'instead he tightened them', she told the court. Mr Burrell also told her he had been involved in a struggle in the back of the ambulance, and that three members of hospital staff had watched while police officers 'injected me into my brain'. She said: 'When I went to see Kingsley he said the police gave him injections into the top of his head, while three mental health staff looked through a window.' Ms Brown-Burrell described her brother, as 'calm, collected and outgoing', but said that he had been worried about a paternity issue with an ex-girlfriend. The woman, Charmaine Clarke, had been claiming that her son was not Mr Burrell's, and had named the child after another man. The inquest heard that Mr Burrell had been trying to get his former partner to take a DNA test to confirm whether he was the father. Mr Burrell believed that the two men had come into the shop to threaten him over the issue, adding that the only reason he wasn't shot was because he had his son with him . Mr Burrell's sister Kadisha (front right) also told the inquest her brother's allegations that police had left him without access to a toilet so he had wet himself . Among Mr Burrell's other allegations, related to the court by his sister and former partner, were that police had kept him in uncomfortably tight handcuffs, and had injected him three times in the head . In a 999 call played to the jury Mr Burrell repeatedly said that 'two black youths and one Asian' put a 'Mach 10' machine gun to his head, and were waiting for him outside the shop. Mr Burrell also claimed that one of the men was the leader of the Burger Bar Crew, a notorious Birmingham gang. But CCTV footage played to the court showed no sign of armed men in the shop. Instead all it showed was Mr Brown looking agitated and gesticulating wildly near the counter. Andy Gillespie, a firefighter who was one of the first on the scene, said Mr Burrell was 'very distressed', struggled to make eye contact was gesticulating and animated while on the phone. In a previous statement Mr Gillespie said that when he approached Mr Burrell he told him he was a 'f****** dead man', adding: 'Two people are trying to kill me. I will be dead in 24 hours.' He said Mr Burrell told him: 'I want everyone here for protection, I am a dead man. Somebody put a gun to my head, there is guys down the road, I am a dead man.' Footage showed Mr Burrell repeatedly pressing his hands together in prayer, and Mr Gillespie said he was saying: 'Praise God, praise Allah'. He said: 'It was almost that he felt relieved that he hadn't been shot.' Kadisha Brown-Burrell (pictured) said that on the first day she went to visit her brother in hospital, after he was arrested, he was 'walking stiff' and couldn't move the upper part of his body . Mr Burrell's partner, Chantelle Graham, said her son, who was with Mr Burrell as he was arrested, repeated 'the black police officer hit my daddy' after she took him home . Ms Graham told the inquest that when she went to pick up her son from a police station an officer told her Mr Burrell had 'gone berserk' in the ambulance . The officer alleged that Mr Burrell had banged his son's head against the wall and that he had to be restrained in order to get the boy away from him. But her son told her a black police officer had started hitting Mr Burrell, the court heard. Ms Graham said: 'Kayden just kept saying, ""The black police officer hit my daddy"" to anyone who would listen. That is what he told everyone, even at school.' Ms Brown-Burrell also said that in the days after Mr Burrell's death, Kayden had said, 'The naughty black policeman did that to daddy.' The inquest also heard that Mr Burrell had been carrying a CS canister on the day he was detained, as well as claims that he was a gang member and drug dealer. The inquest continues tomorrow and is expected to last six weeks.

"When Hillary Clinton steps off her road-trip van on Tuesday at a rural Iowa community college, she might not be greeted by cheering throngs. Daily Mail Online spoke to students at Kirkwood Community College's regional center in Jones County, where the former secretary of state will hold her first low-key campaign event. The outlook isn't sunny for the kickoff of her 'listening tour': Of the ten students interviewed in the school's public lounge, only two would speak kindly of Mrs. Clinton. 'She's going to push some emotional thing on us,' predicted student Hallie Corum in between classes. 'What else is she supposed to do?' 'She's going to be, like, talking s**t.' 'TALKING S**T': Hillary Clinton launched her presidential campaign on Sunday and hit the road in a van, en route to a skeptical bunch of community college students in Monticello, Iowa . Corey Jones said he suspects that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama want immigration reform because it would result in a new generation of grateful Democratic voters – and he plans to ask her about it on Tuesday . Kirkwood Community College's outpost in rural Monticello serves hundreds of students, including some who are still high school juniors and seniors . Corum declined to be photographed, flashing an impish grin. Corey Jones, a graphic design student, is among those chosen to question Mrs. Clinton in a roundtable setting on Tuesday. He said his teachers chose him to join a group of 'from 6 to 8' students whowill participate because 'I pay attention to politics,' something his friends around a table agreed with. 'I didn't know Hillary Clinton was running,' one young woman said. 'Is she running? Go ask Corey. He's up on all that stuff.' Jones said he plans to ask Hillary about illegal immigration. 'It's – well, Immigration reform,' he told Daily Mail Online. 'You know, Obama's plan was to make the illegal immigrants legal.' 'She's part of all that. And some people think – well, I think maybe – it's just a tactic to have more Democratic votes' from millions of grateful new citizens. Jones, like Corum, will vote in his first presidential election next year. He said Clinton is holding her first campaign event at a community college 'because she's trying to appeal to youth, to young voters.' 'She announced it on YouTube. That's targeted at people my age, right?' Clinton set off on a 1,000-mile road trip Sunday in her home town of Chappaqua, New York, and headed to Iowa – where the nation's first primary caucuses will start the machinery that chooses major parties' presidential candidate. She announced Sunday afternoon that she was officially in the race. A female student who declined to be named speculated about Clinton's motives for taking ground transportation instead of a jet aircraft. 'Can you imagine if she stepped off a private jet in Des Moines or Iowa City and walked down a set of steps in realy expensive shoes and a thousand-dollar outfit?' she asked. 'That would be, um, a really bad idea. I like the van better. Is it a minivan? God, I hope it's not a minivan.' Future chef Ross Vander Peut said gay marriage is a 'deal-breaker' for him but worries that Hillary Clinton 'seems like, kinda like a control freak' Monticello, Iowa is a sleepy farm town whose main street is lined with shops sporting signs that look like relics from the mid-twentieth century . Most students in Monday's random sample chose not to talk about Mrs. Clinton. All of the will be old enough to vote next year for the first time in their lives. Three said they didn't have an opinion about the Democratic front-runner. One looked up, shook her head, and put a pair of earbuds on. Two more said they would rather remain silent. 'You know, it's that ""If you don't have something nice to say, don't say anything at all"" deal,' a young woman offered from behind her tablet computer. Moments later a group of young men walked down a hallway mimicking Bill Clinton's infamous 'I did not have sexual relations with that woman' press conference – and laughing uproariously. One who would talk is Bri Parks, a speech and psychology student who wants to be an FBI profiler because she likes 'trying to figure out how the human brain works.' Clinton can work to earn her vote, Parks said. 'If I heard her opinions and liked her ideas, I would support her.' But 'I hope people don't vote for her just because she's a woman.' Asked for the nicest thing she could say about Mrs. Clinton, Parks said 'she's not going at this saying, ""Look, I'm a woman, so vote for me."" She's not using her sex to prove a point.' 'She's looking at herself as a politician, not as a woman.' Students like these gathered in a Kirkwood Community College lounge and spoke with Daily Mail Online before and after classes on Monday . Bri Parks, a Kirkwood Community College student, said she hopes Americans don't vote for Hillary Clinton 'just because she's a woman' 'I don't think we should be putting people in extremely high political positions because of race, sex, or whatever,' Parks explained. 'Then you're doing things just because of what people look like.' Kirkwood serves between 22,000 and 26,000 students taking college-credit courses at sites in seven Iowa counties, according to a school official. The Monticello outpost is canceling many classes on Tuesday, making some students scratch their heads since 'this is the smallest part of Kirkwood,' as one pointed out. 'They could have had it somewhere else.' As it is, Kirkwood's students who do have class will have to dodge Secret Service agents and TV news cameras to get through the lobby. Some of them are recent high school graduates while others are finishing their 11th- and 12th-grade years collecting college credits one day per week. Ross Vander Peut, a self-described future chef, is one of the youngest. He's 16, a high-school junior, but will turn 18 just before the election. Vander Peut described himself as a libertarian – 'I like government to leave me alone,' he said – and gay marriage is 'a deal-breaker.' 'Equal rights, homosexual rights, it's one thing I will not sway on,' he told Daily Mail Online. 'If you are against gay marriage, you've lost my vote. There's nothing you can do to change it.' He hedged on Hillary, saying she 'seems like, kinda like a control freak.' 'But she also seems very strong-willed and determined. When she wants something done she probably does it herself.'","Daily Mail Online spoke to ten students at Kirkwood Community College's satellite campus in rural Iowa where Hillary Clinton will be Tuesday .

"(CNN)A fiery sunset greeted people in Washington Sunday. The deep reddish color caught Seattle native Tim Durkan's eye. He photographed a handful of aerial shots of the sunset warming the city's skyline and shared them on CNN iReport. The stunning sunsets were the result of raging wildfires in parts of Siberia. ""The dramatic sunsets began showing up over the weekend and had Seattle locals wondering where the amber-colored haze was originating from,"" Durken said. The fires were started in southeastern Siberia, by farmers burning grass in their fields. But on April 14, it is believed that the flames quickly grew out of control because of strong winds and spread throughout the region, according to CNN affiliate KOMO-TV. As a result, the fires have destroyed dozens of villages in the region. Rescue crews were able to put out the flames. However, the lingering smoke from the widespread fires were picked up by atmospheric winds. The winds carried the smoke from Siberia across the Pacific Ocean and brought it to the Pacific Northwest. Parts of Oregon, Washington and British Columbia are seeing the results of the smoke, wind and solar light combination. The reason people are seeing an intense red sunset is a result of smoke particles filtering out the shorter wavelength colors from the sunlight like greens, blues, yellows and purples, KOMO-TV said. That means colors like red and orange are able to penetrate the air unfiltered. The colors are especially intense during sunrises and sunsets because there is more atmosphere for the light to travel through to get to a person's eye. As the smoke starts to dissipate, air quality will get better and these fiery sunsets will lose their reddish hue.","Smoke from massive fires in Siberia created fiery sunsets in the Pacific Northwest .

"(The Hollywood Reporter)Richard Dysart, the Emmy-winning actor who portrayed the cranky senior partner Leland McKenzie in the slick, long-running NBC drama ""L.A. Law,"" has died. He was 86. Dysart, who also played Coach in the original 1972 Broadway production of Jason Miller's Pulitzer Prize-winning ""That Championship Season,"" died Sunday at home in Santa Monica after a long illness, his wife, artist Kathryn Jacobi, told The Hollywood Reporter. The acclaimed ""L.A. Law"" — created by Steven Bochco (who eventually handed off the series to David E. Kelley) and Terry Louise Fisher — aired for eight seasons from 1986 to 1994. For playing the founder of the firm McKenzie, Brackman, Chaney and Kuzak, Dysart was nominated for the Emmy for outstanding supporting actor in a drama series for four straight years, finally winning the trophy in 1992. ""I always had him in mind for that role,"" Bochco said in a 2002 interview with the Archive of American Television. ""He's so avuncular. So I reached out to him. You know, Dick is sort of an old hippie. So he went into his closet and tried to find a lawyer outfit, and he came to meet us wearing a suit and tie. He was perfect."" ""We got together, mapped out the character's past to give us a basis from which to work, and it's all gone smoothly since then,"" Dysart said in a 1990 interview with The Seattle Times. ""Sometimes I worry — it's all been going too well — a role I love to play in a series that's about as good as you can get. Something's wrong!"" Perhaps Dysart's most memorable character arc on the show was when he was found in bed with power-hungry competitor Rosalind Shays (played by Diana Muldaur). He was one of the few actors to appear in every episode. Dysart's range of authority -figure parts ran right to the top. He limned Harry Truman in the CBS telefilm ""Day One"" and in the ABC miniseries ""War and Remembrance,"" both of which aired in 1989, and he was Henry L. Stimson, the 33rd U.S. president's Secretary of War, in the 1995 HBO telefilm ""Truman,"" starring Gary Sinise. Similarly, he played the Secretary of Defense in ""Meteor"" (1979). Hollywood Reporter: Most powerful people in N.Y. media . Dysart also performed extensively in the medical- (movie) field, performing enough doctor roles to, perhaps, qualify to practice. His two most memorable came in classic satires: in Paddy Chayevsky's scathing ""The Hospital"" (1971), starring George C. Scott (a good friend), and in ""Being There"" (1979), as Melvyn Douglas' doctor. He also was a doctor who died a gruesome death in John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" (1982) and a physician in such films as ""The Terminal Man"" (1974), ""The Falcon and the Snowman"" (1985) and ""Warning Sign"" (1985). Dysart portrayed J. Edgar Hoover in the 1993 USA telefilm ""Marilyn & Bobby: Her Final Affair"" and in Mario Van Peebles' ""Panther"" (1995). Dysart also excelled as cranky coots and shifty sorts. He portrayed a motel receptionist in Richard Lester's ""Petulia"" (1968); was the bad guy who battled Clint Eastwood in ""Pale Rider"" (1985); stood out as a power player in Oliver Stone's ""Wall Street"" (1987); and sold barbwire in ""Back to the Future III"" (1990). Dysart was born March 30, 1929, in Boston and raised in Maine. Following high school, he attended the Gould Academy in Bethel, Maine, for a year, served in the U.S. Air Force and attended Emerson College, where he graduated with a master's degree in speech communications. At the time, he was interested in a career in radio (he became fascinated with the medium in first grade, when he was bedridden for a year because of rheumatic fever) but was soon tempted by acting. He moved to New York on a whim and was able to land minor roles on TV and a part in an off-Broadway production of ""The Iceman Cometh"" opposite Jason Robards. In the mid-1960s, he joined the American Conservatory Theater and toured the country doing plays, then landed roles on Broadway in ""All in Good Time,"" ""The Little Foxes"" and ""A Place Without Doors."" He received a Drama Desk Award for his performance in ""That Championship Season."" Hollywood Reporter: Q&A with Liz Smith . Dysart's credits include an eclectic array of movies, including ""The Crazy World of Julius Vrooder"" (1974), ""The Day of the Locust"" (1975), ""The Hindenburg"" (1975), ""An Enemy of the People"" (1978), ""Prophecy"" (1979), ""Mask"" (1985) and ""Hard Rain"" (1998). On television, he was top-notch in the telefilms ""The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman"" (1974), ""The People vs. Jean Harris"" (1981), as Dwight D. Eisenhower in ""The Last Days of Patton"" (1986) and as studio chief Louis B. Mayer in ""Malice in Wonderland"" (1985). Survivors also include his stepson Arie and daughter-in-law Jeannine Jacobi, mother-in-law Lenore, brother and sister-in-law Nadine and John Jacobi and grandchildren Abby and Levi. A private memorial is being planned. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations be made to the Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum, an outdoor theater in Topanga Canyon in the Los Angeles area. Dysart and Jacobi had a second home in the forests of British Columbia. He was lured out of retirement for his last onscreen appearance, the ""L.A. Law"" reunion telefilm of 2002. ""They remain timely, with cases about points of law that are still current,"" he said of watching ""L.A. Law"" reruns in a 2002 interview with The Bangor Daily News. ""[The show] was also one of the fathers of yuppiedom. It was very much of the times, and very Los Angeles. It holds up as well as any series I know.""

"This gruesome video shows how a man popped a huge cyst in his arm with a needle, screwdriver and a pair of pliers. The man, known only as Jason, from Vancouver, uploaded the clip to YouTube after his wife filmed the stomach-churning moment. It begins with him explaining exactly how he will pop the grape-sized growth on his wrist. He says: 'We have the pliers, they're going to hold onto the needle which will then be smashed into my cyst with the end of a screwdriver. 'It should be pretty cool.' The man, known only as Jason, uploaded the video to YouTube of his unique way of popping a cyst - using a needle, a pair of pliers and a screwdriver. Pictured is his sister in law putting the needle into the swelling . As Jason's sister in law hammers the needle deeper into the cyst with the handle of a screwdriver, he emits loud cries of pain . First, he lays his left arm down on some kitchen roll on a table so the lump is easily accessible. His sister-in-law then inserts the needle into the cyst and holds it in place with a pair of pliers as he winces. She then begins the horrifying process of hammering the needle deeper into the growth. Sharp cries of pain are heard from Jason with each hit. Astonishingly, though the process seems too agonising to bear, Jason says: 'I think we can go a little deeper'. After one last hammer – which was once again met with a loud moan – he says: 'It's in there pretty good. Now we've got to pull it out. Dr Arun Ghosh, a private GP in Liverpool, condemned Jason's method of popping his cyst with a needle, pliers and a screwdriver. He told MailOnline: 'We advise not draining minor ganglions. 'They just get bigger and bigger. We only drain it if they are very large and hindering the use of the hand. 'It’s wrong to pop a ganglion with a needle and a screwdriver on so many levels. Traditionally, ganglions would be 'bashed with the family bible', but doctors do not advise this . 'From a hygiene point of view you’ve got to sterilise your equipment. We would never insert a needle that would be used in the house. They are covered in millions of bacteria. 'You can never control the force by using a screwdriver, and that’s dangerous. 'There are very fine arteries and nerves in the hand, and they’re so easy to damage. 'If they are damaged you get irreversible pain. If you think how often you use your hand that can be debilitating. 'There used to be a myth that you should bash a ganglion with a family bible to burst it. 'That’s caused problems with the fluid going into the wrist joint, causing carpel tunnel syndrome: swelling inside the wrist. 'If we did treat it, we’d do a needle aspiration, which means sucking out the glue-like pus. 'But that would be what is known as ""aseptic"", meaning the pus would be drawn out into the syringe and would never touch the wound, to prevent infection. 'We would also do it under ultrasound so as not to damage the fine veins and arteries in the hand. 'If you have a ganglion or a swelling you must go to your GP and they will advise whether its OK or whether it’s best to be left alone. 'Then it will be followed up and receive proper after care.' 'I'm going to see if we can get the fluid squirting out if it does.' Moments later, he takes the needle out and asks the camera to zoom in on his arm. As he squeezes the cyst, sticky, translucent jelly comes rushing out and gathers in a pea-sized ball. 'Let's see what the consistency looks like,' he said as he rubs the gluey substance between two fingers. He adds: 'This is probably the grossest thing I've ever seen – since the last time I've done this. 'This will probably do the trick for three or so months until I have to pop it again.' Uploading the video to YouTube under the name 'The Wrist Cyst', he promises to upload another video in another three months time when he pops the cyst again. Unsurprisingly, medical professionals do not advise using Jason's method to treat lumps found on the body. Dr Arun Ghosh, a private GP in Liverpool, explains that Jason's cyst is a ganglion, a fluid-filled swelling that develops near a joint or a tendon. They are made up of a thick jelly-like fluid called synovial fluid, which surrounds joints and tendons to lubricate them during movement - and occur when this fluid leaks out and collects under the skin. Ganglions can occur alongside any joint in the body, but are most commonly found on the wrist, hand and fingers. Generally harmless, if they do not cause any pain, they can be left alone and will disappear without any treatment. Dr Ghosh said: 'We advise not draining minor ganglions. They just get bigger and bigger. We only drain it if they are very large and hindering the use of the hand. 'A ganglion is a fluid-filled sack. If you start the drainage process, the bigger and bigger the sack will fill. 'This is the issue this gentleman has caused, he’ll need to drain it more often.' Traditionally, ganglions were treated by being 'bashed with the family Bible', but this is no longer recommended, as this could cause the fluid to disperse and cause carpel tunnel syndrome - a swelling in the wrist - he added. Dr Ghosh added Jason's method was also not advisable either. He told MailOnline: 'It’s wrong to pop a ganglion with a needle and a screwdriver on so many levels. It’s unhygienic, you can’t control the force and you could damage the nerves in the hand. 'From a hygiene point of view you’ve got to sterilise your equipment. We would never insert a needle that would be used in the house. They are covered in millions of bacteria. 'You can never control the force by using a screwdriver, and that’s dangerous. 'There are very fine arteries and nerves in the hand, and they’re so easy to damage. If they are damaged you get irreversible pain. If you think how often you use your hand that can be debilitating.' He removes the needle and squeezes the cyst, and a ball of sticky, see-through jelly-like fluid emerges . Jason rubs his fingers together to show the sticky consistency of the fluid that comes out of the growth, which doctors explain is synovial fluid, which surrounds joints and tendons to lubricate them . At the end of the video, Jason says the cyst will need draining again in three months. But doctors strongly advise against his method - and say ganglions do not normally require treatment . If the cyst needs treatment, the fluid should be drained out with a needle and syringe by a doctor, or cut out in a surgical procedure. Dr Ghosh added: 'If we did treat it, we’d do a needle aspiration, which means sucking out the glue-like pus. 'But that would be what is known as ""aseptic"", meaning the pus would be drawn out into the syringe and would never touch the wound, to prevent infection. 'We would also do it under ultrasound so as not to damage the fine veins and arteries in the hand. 'If you have a ganglion or a swelling you must go to your GP and they will advise whether its OK or whether it’s best to be left alone. 'Then it will be followed up and receive proper after care.'","The man, known only as Jason, is filmed popping the ganglion on his wrist .

"Manchester City have decided to listen to offers for Yaya Toure and Samir Nasri this summer as the Barclays Premier League champions look to repair the damage of a disastrous title defence. City manager Manuel Pellegrini is under intense scrutiny following Sunday’s 4-2 defeat by neighbours Manchester United. But as the City board refuse to give up on their manager just yet the decision has been made to jettison high-profile players who the club believe have failed them. Manchester City have decided to listen to offers for Ivorian midfielder Yaya Toure this summer . The Premier League champions are also open to allowing Samir Nasri leave the Etihad Stadium . Toure will be made available before his value in the market dwindles. Nasri, meanwhile, has barely played since his lame showing in the Champions League at Barcelona. Defender Aleksandar Kolarov and striker Edin Dzeko are also short of admirers within the club, while midfielder James Milner is out of contract this summer. Toure may be difficult to sell as he earns in excess of £1million a month. Pellegrini is vulnerable but may be saved by a relatively undemanding fixture list up to the end of the season and by the fact that City’s No 1 choice to replace him, Pep Guardiola, is contracted to Bayern Munich for another year. However, City fear captain Vincent Kompany will miss a few weeks of the run-in with a thigh injury.","Manchester City were beaten 4-2 by their rivals United at Old Trafford .

"Two former police officials who quit their jobs in Parma, Missouri, have revealed what they say are the real reasons they stepped down. A black woman, Tyus Byrd,  was recently elected mayor of the town over the white incumbent candidate Randall Ramsey, MailOnline reported earlier this week. Six city officials quit their jobs shortly after Byrd won, according to multiple reports. Two of those individuals - Trish Cohen, Parma's former police chief, and Rich Medley, the town's former assistant police chief - recently spoke to NBC News. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Trish Cohen, Parma's former police chief, and Rich Medley, the town's former assistant police chief,  quit their jobs with the city. Tyus Byrd, who is black, was recently elected mayor. Cohen has said she and Medley feared for their safety, and their home addresses had been shared online by Byrd's family members . Cohen alleged in the interview with the news outlet that she and Medley feared for their safety, and said their home addresses had been shared online by Byrd's family members. Referring to Byrd, Cohen told NBC News 'You can't have an anti-police mayor, and that's the way she made me feel.' 'My decision was not, did not, come lightly. At all,' Cohen also said. 'It has nothing to do with race. If it had anything to do with race, I'd done never went to work in the town.' Medley told NBC News 'From the moment [Byrd] announced her candidacy, she never approached any of us, never advised us what her plans were or anything. Never asked us to stay or told us that the moment she took office that we weren't going to have a job. 'We were in the dark on it, and then in hearing from her supporters that she was going to fire all of us, might as well start looking for something else.' Mayor: Tyus Byrd, pictured, has said she doesn't know what the 'safety issues' were and that she 'never said anything about cleaning house' Six city officials quit their jobs shortly after Byrd was elected to serve as Parma's mayor . Byrd, meanwhile, told NBC News she did not know the reason the city employees quit. She also told the news outlet she did not believe race played a role. In an interview with the media outlet, Byrd said 'It was cited to me that it was safety issues. I would love to know what those safety issues are. 'I wish we could have sat down and came to whatever the reasons were, that maybe we could have came to some type of agreement and understanding.' Speaking to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Byrd said 'I don’t understand. I never said anything about cleaning house.' The newspaper reported that while speaking to the Post-Dispatch, 'Medley acknowledged that Byrd had never threatened to fire officers, nor publicly indicated that she would interfere with police.' Medley told Daily Mail Online on Thursday, referring to the remarks Byrd earlier made to NBC News about wanting to have discussed issues together, 'She never made any attempts to talk with us during her candidacy or after winning the election. It's very hard to believe someone truly wanted to work with the police department in regards to their concerns when no effort is made. 'Add to that the information we were receiving from her supporters about firing us when she took office. It's not hard to understand that we did not believe we would have jobs after April 14th at 5p.m.' Cohen did not respond to a message seeking comment on social media Wednesday, and on Thursday her Facebook page appeared to have been taken down. Byrd did not respond to a request for comment on social media Wednesday, and did not immediately return requests on Thursday. A phone number listed for the town's city hall on its website appeared to in fact be a fax number when dialed by a reporter.","Tyus Byrd, who is black, was recently elected mayor of Parma, Missouri .

"Hillary Clinton has garnered one of her first major endorsements in run bid for the White House: The nation's largest lesbian political action committee. The group, LPAC, launched Lesbians4Hillary on Monday to support the former First Lady's bid to become the nation's first female president. Lesbians4Hillary, co-chaired by pioneering tennis great Billie Jean King, said: 'Hillary Clinton is a proven leader and she has a strong track record when it comes to inclusion -- specifically for women and the LGBTQ community. Scroll down for video . Tennis star Billie Jean King (right) is co-chairing the Lesbians4Hillary campaign. King, pictured with Clinton in 2008, helped run the former Fiirst Lady's 2008 Women for Hillary Clinton wing . King, pictured with Clinton in 2001, said: 'Hillary Clinton is a proven leader and she has a strong track record when it comes to inclusion -- specifically for women and the LGBTQ community' 'Her entire career has been a road map to get her to this moment and she has earned my respect and my vote to become the next President of the United States of America. I am honored to join LPAC and help lead our effort to elect Hillary Clinton in 2016.' King, who was outed as a lesbian in 1981, was a leader of the group 'Women for Hillary' in 2008, as well. The video in which Hillary announced she was running for president included a clip of a lesbian couple . The Twitter handle for the new group is @lezs4hillary . Many gays and lesbians point to Clinton's 2011 speech in Switzerland as Secretary of State in which she declared: 'Human rights are gay rights and gay rights are human rights.' In the video released yesterday announcing Clinton's candidacy for president, two gay couples were included. Among them, two lesbians who look lovingly into each other's eyes. However, in her 2008 campaign, Clinton did not support gay marriage. It took her five years - to publicly say that she supported gay marriage. President Barack Obama publicly announced his support for gay marriage nearly a year earlier in March 2012. The Economist called Clinton's stance on gay marriage, 'cautious to the point of cowardice.' 'It is not convincing to argue, as her supporters do, that she is only free to make her views known now that she has stepped down as America's chief diplomat. Her successor at the State Department, John Kerry, and has not been stoned as a blasphemer on any of his stops around the world to date,' the magazine's US columnist wrote. Critics also point out that as First Lady, she did not oppose her husband signing 'Don't Ask Don't Tell,' which banned being openly gay in the military or the Defense of Marriage Act, which banned gay marriage at the federal level.","LPAC, a pro-LGBT Super PAC, launched Lesbians4Hillary on Monday .

"Under pressure Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola has revealed that 'only the treble is enough' for his team as they attempt to overturn their 3-1 deficit against Porto in the Champions League. Bayern host the Portuguese side on Tuesday and Guardiola is confident the Bundesliga leaders will emerge victorious. 'I am completely convinced that my players will take their chances,' Guardiola said. 'I know which club I am at and know that (league) champions and cup winners is not enough. Only the treble is enough.' Pep Guardiola is targeting winning  three trophies with Bayern Munich this season .

Philipp Lahm will look to lead his team into the semi-final of the Champions League on Tuesday . Bayern remain on course for three trophies, leading the Bundesliga by 12 points and will meet Borussia Dortmund in the German Cup semi-final. The Bavarians won the treble under then coach Jupp Heynckes in 2013, just before Guardiola took over. The current Bayern boss also won the treble with Barcelona in 2009, when they became the first Spanish club to win the domestic league and cup as well as the Champions League in the same season. Ahead of the visit of Porto, Guardiola said on Monday that France winger Franck Ribery is highly unlikely to recover from an ankle injury in time to feature for Bayern. Ribery has been out for more than a month and Guardiola said it was more likely the player would miss the second leg of the quarter-final in Munich as the Germans look to recover from a stunning 3-1 defeat in Portugal last week. 'I do not think that Franck can play,' Guardiola told reporters. 'I will speak with the our doctor but my feeling is that he can't make it.' Guardiola's hopes of turning the tie around have been hampered by a string of injury absences, including to key players Arjen Robben, David Alaba, Javi Martinez and Medhi Benatia. Bastian Schweinsteiger is also fighting to get fit in time for the game and Guardiola said the Germany captain would train with the team late on Monday for the first time.

'Bastian Schweinsteiger will today train again for the first time and the more players I have the better,' Guardiola added. The Spaniard, who wore a T-shirt made by the family of an Argentine journalist killed in a car crash at last year's World Cup, said his team would try everything to overturn the first leg deficit despite the injury problems. 'It makes no sense to be on the pitch if you don't want to turn it around. We want to turn it around,' he said.","Porto beat Bayern Munich 3-1 in Champions League quarter-final first leg .

"Despite Arsenal winning their eighth Premier League game in a row on Saturday, the club's chief executive Ivan Gazidis says he is 'not happy' that the club are not going to win the title. With top spot set to elude Arsenal again, Gazidis says the club will 'keep pushing' Chelsea, but he admitted winning the championship is unlikely.

"A 33-year-old professional skydiver who has made more than 6,000 dives was killed during a dive in Florida on Wednesday, after her chute apparently collided with another mid-air. Jessica Edgeington, of Villa Rica, Georgia, was a skilled diver known for a type of high-speed sport called 'swooping', where divers speed down to land and sweep over buoys and other obstacles on the surface of a pond as competition. She died after plummeting to the ground at the Skydive DeLand in DeLand, Florida. It is the second death at the skydiving center this year, after Navy SEAL William Marston died after landing heavily in January. It is unclear what type of dive Edgeinton was maneuvering, but she appears to have run into a problem in the air. First responders arrived about 4.10pm and Edgeington was pronounced dead at the scene. Tragedy: Jessica Edgeington, 33, a professional skydiver, was killed in a dive on Wednesday in DeLand, Florida, after apparently colliding with another dive mid-air . Professional: Edgeington had made over 6,000 jumps and competed in a sport called 'swooping', where divers speed down to land and swoop over buoys and other obstacles on the surface of a pond as competition . Investigation: It is unclear what type of dive Edgeinton was maneuvering, but she appears to have run into a problem in the air, but the crash is under investigation . Scene: Edgeington was pronounced dead at DeLand Municipal Airport on Wednesday about 4.10pm . Local media reports say Edgeington collided with another diver, causing a problem with her parachute. However the crash is currently under investigation. According to The Tampa Bay Times,  'swoopers' like Edgeington jump from the plane at 5,000 feet and reach speeds of 90 miles per hour as they descend. The sport is about how the person can handle their parachute and make maneuvers, including turns and twists. Edgeington gave an interview with the Associated Press in May last year while competing for a spot on the U.S. Parachute Team. 'It's not necessarily scary to jump out of the plane anymore,' she said. Killed: Jessica Edgeington, seen here at a swooping course,  died Wednesday afternoon after flying out of Skydive DeLand in Florida on Wednesday . Edgeington continued in the interview: 'I get competition nerves when I'm at something like this. 'So that's probably the most nerve wracking thing, is getting ready to compete. 'Trying to perform and do your best. Hopefully not mess up.' On her Facebook page, Edgeington lists herself as a 'canopy coach' for PD Factory Team. Canopy coaches educate skydivers of every level, from beginners working on accuracy to advanced semi-pros and elite military personnel. Her page was inundated with messages from family, friends and colleagues following the tragedy on Wednesday. Crash: Jessica Edgeington, 33, of Villa Rica, Georgia, died Wednesday afternoon at Skydive DeLand . It is the second death at the the DeLand field this year. In January, William 'Blake' Marston, a Navy SEAL learning how to skydive, died after hitting the land too hard, according to My News 13. The field is at DeLand Municipal Airport. Tributes: Hundreds of tributes have flooded in for the skydiver, describing her as a 'wonderful soul' Two other men died in separate incidents at Skydive DeLand in 2013. That year, in the 3.2 million jumps that happened across the country, the United States Parachute Associated recorded a total of 24 fatal skydiving accidents. There are thousands of dives at Skydive Delandeach year. It is also the home of SkyDive University, a professional skydiving instruction and coaching organization.","Jessica Edgeington, 33, had made over 6,000 jumps .

"A New York woman has worn the same ensemble to work every day for three years. Matilda Kahl, an art director at Saatchi & Saatchi, wears the exact same ‘uniform’ – an outfit made up of black trousers, white shirt and a custom leather rosette – every single day because, as she explains to DailyMail.com: 'When at work, I want to be judged on my work and my work only.' In an article for Harper's Bazaar, Matilda explained that the unique sartorial idea came to her after a particularly stressful morning when, with 'a fairly important meeting on the horizon' she began trying on a variety outfits to no satisfaction. Scroll down for video . Empowering: Saatchi & Saatchi art director Matilda Kahl has got everyone talking about her everyday work 'uniform' 'I'm given complete freedom over what I wear to the office, but that still left me questioning each piece that I added or subtracted from my outfit,' she wrote. '[I kept thinking], ""Is this too formal? Is that too out there? Is this dress too short?"" I finally chose something I regretted as soon as I hit the subway platform.' Arriving at her meeting late, frazzled and wearing an inside-out sweater, while her male colleagues and new boss looked relaxed and at-ease, left her feeling frustrated and wondering why she'd bothered with the stress of it at all. 'I knew my male colleagues were taken seriously no matter what they wore - and I highly doubted they put in as much sartorial time and effort as I had,' she writes. 'But gender issues aside, I needed to come up with a solution to simplify this morning struggle.' Vowing to never let herself feel that way again, Matilda made the decision to make the same simple, easy wardrobe choices as many of her male colleagues did, wearing the same outfit each and every day, thereby eliminating the seemingly endless struggle to determine what to wear. Simple, yet effective: Matilda achieved her look by buying blouses in bulk and pairing them only with black trousers . She found her sartorial salvation in the form of 15 identical white silk blouses and several pairs of simple black trousers. For a 'personal touch' she added a custom-made leather rosette in homage to her mother, who used to love putting bows in her hair. She also throws on a black blazer for the chillier days. 'I’ve always thought black and white looks stylish, so it was a pretty easy decision on the color,' she explains to Daily Mail Online, adding that she took her time deciding on the exact designs. 'I finally fell for the white shirt for its diagonal button line and the cuts in the sleeves. 'New York gets really hot in the summer, so as an alternative to the 6 pants I bought 2 matte black skirts. Simple and sweet.' With her identical every day look, Matilda is following in the footsteps of many high-powered individuals, from Steve Jobs to Mark Zuckerberg - who says he owns 20 identical grey t-shirts for work. All tied up: Matilda tops off her look with a simple black leather bow, which she calls her 'personal touch' inspired by her mother's affinity for bows in her hair . But despite many people trying out the trend before her, Matilda admitted that she faced 'mixed reactions' to her new uniform idea from her co-workers. She was asked if she had lost a bet, joined a cult and some even assumed she was too destitute to afford other work clothing. But when confronted with endless questions about her new look, she shot back with: 'Have you ever set up a bill for online auto-pay? Did it feel good to have one less thing to deal with every month?' Many critics also wonder: why doesn't she just choose her outfit the night before? 'To me, that would only move the problem to another time of day, not really solving it,' she says. 'It would just make me go to bed later and lose valuable sleep. 'Nor would it solve the pressure of constantly feeling that I have to express my creative ability through my way of dressing, which is something I feel relieved from now with the uniform.' According to Matilda, the criticism has done nothing but reassure her of her choices. 'People have really put it to the test, and I’m happy to say the more questions I get the more sure I become of that I’m happy with my choice of wearing a uniform,' she explains. All in all, Matilda is immensely pleased with her decision, saying it has saved her huge amounts of money– and also removed a source of stress from her life completely. She also claims it has given her a new sense of control. Coming up to three years in her look, Matilda doesn't see herself stopping anytime soon - but insists that if the mood strikes her, she could go back to planning her daily wardrobe. 'I still feel like it does a good job for me so I see no reason for stopping wearing the uniform,' she says. 'But if I would wake up one day and feel like start spending time on picking out an outfit every morning, I’d no problem with giving it up. The uniform is here for me, I’m not here for the uniform.' She does however admit that she has had to re-stock her collection of white shirts - because the 15 that she bought originally have become so worn out that she is no longer able to wear them. 'They are all exactly the same and have been for almost three years, up until a week ago,' she added to Harper's Bazaar. 'The shirts had gotten worn out, others stained....So last weekend I spent two days on a rather intense hunt for a new hero shirt. I finally found it at Zara.'","Matilda Kahl, an art director at Saatchi & Saatchi, owns 15 of the same white shirt and several pairs of plain black trousers .

"A health expert has slammed parents for not taking vaccination seriously after 19 children attending a primary school in north Brisbane contracted the potentially deadly disease whooping cough. Kilcoy State School is working with Queensland Health after a whooping cough outbreak in the area, but parents have been urged to take vaccination more seriously there. The Sunshine Coast Daily reports that infectious diseases expert Professor Matthew Cooper, a professorial research fellow at the University of Queensland's Institute for Molecular Bioscience, attributed the outbreak to an anti-vaccination trend. Parents have been accused of not taking vaccination seriously after 19 children attending a primary school in north Brisbane contracted whooping cough . 'It's unfortunately just part of a growing trend that many people have decided not to immunise,' he said. 'We've seen this with other diseases that are more serious than pertussis but unfortunately the more people who choose not to immunise the more likely it is we'll get outbreaks.' Although immunisation rates in Queensland have dropped across most age groups there since 2010, in 2014 the Metro North region had the highest immunisation rate in the state. Kilcoy State School (pictured) in north Brisbane is working with Queensland Health after a whooping cough outbreak in the area . There are about 1200 cases of whooping cough every year in the Metro North area. This region covers the Brisbane River to past Caboolture. in total there have been 86 confirmed cases in 2015 - alarmingly 16 in the past week - compared to 113 last year. Statewide, 232 cases have been reported. Parents were urged to take children with any symptoms to their family doctor . Dr Cooper said it was essential to convince parents of the importance of vaccination. He said if vaccination rates continued to fall there could be an increase in unfortunate and preventable deaths. Parents were urged parents to take children with any symptoms to their family doctor, and for children who tested positive to stay away from school for five days.","Kilcoy State School working with Queensland Health to improve situation .

"Ed Miliband's poor leadership has been mocked by a Labour candidate, who said it was like having 'a manager of a football team that you don't rate, but you still support the team'. Paul Gilbert even joked that he hoped his 'off-piste' comment would not 'find it's way back' to the Labour leadership, because he stands little hope of winning in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. He also blasted Labour's 'entirely unsatisfactory' policy on tuition fees and told voters at a university hustings: 'I don't like where we are.' Scroll down for video . Labour candidate Paul Gilbert mocked Ed Miliband and then joked that he hoped his 'off-piste' comment would not 'find it's way back' to the Labour leadership . Mr Miliband has faced repeated criticism and off-the-record briefing about his leadership among Labour ranks, but most have seen the sense of keeping quiet about their misgivings during the election campaign. But Mr Gilbert felt no such reservations as he appeared at a hustings event with four other candidates. The 52-year-old lawyer was asked for his comments on higher eduction funding by a member of the audience at the packed event at the University of Gloucestershire. He said: 'If I can go off-piste a little, as somebody who has a very realistic idea of what the maths will be in this constituency, maybe what I say isn't going to find it's way back to Mr Miliband and his friends.' He added: 'Now one of the things which has brought me to politics at this very late stage you might think is the wish to make a difference. Now I am a Labour man and I will stand by my party, thick and thin. 'It's a bit like having a manager of a football team that you don't rate, but you still support the team, sometimes. 'What we have to do is work out how we can make the difference best, and from my point of view you're better on the inside making a difference than being on the outside grumbling about it.' To laughter from the audience, he was mocked by one of his fellow candidates for his 'glowing endorsement' for Labour's leader. Ed Miliband, pictured giving a speech in Stockton-on-Tees today, has promised to cut tuition fees from up to £9,000 to £6,000 if he is elected on May 7 . Ed Miliband has revealed his childhood dream was to become a London bus conductor. The Labour leader said a fascination with the ticket machines on the old-style vehicles had made him want the job. Mr Miliband made the admission during a visit to Stockton-on-Tees, where he was asked by a young boy in the audience, Nelson Driscoll, what he wanted to be when he was seven years old. He replied: 'I wanted to be a bus conductor. I tell you why, because on the London buses there used to be these things where you used to turn around the ticket machine. I was particularly fascinated by that.' Mr Miliband is not the only party leader to have dreamed of being on the buses. Conservative former prime minister Sir John Major once failed a test to become a bus conductor. The seat of Cheltenham is held by the Lib Dem Martin Horwood, who secured a majority of 4,920 over the Conservatives in 2010. But the constituency is seen as crucial to Tory hopes of winning an overall majority in the Commons. However, five years ago Labour secured just 5 per cent of the vote. Mr Miliband has promised to cut tuition fees from up to £9,000 to £6,000 if he is elected on May 7. Critics have argued the only people to benefit from the reductions will be wealthy graduates, because most people would never pay back the full amount during their working lifetime. But Mr Gilbert appeared to suggest the party should have gone further in reducing the cost of gaining a degree. He said: 'You know that in the Labour manifesto the fees will come down to £6,000 - it still feels entirely unsatisfactory.' He added: 'But it seems to me with two daughters who are 22 and 20, and they have been saddled with debt as the gentleman in the audience mentioned earlier. 'I find it really silly and really ridiculous that we have not worked this one through sufficiently well. 'We have choices. We have choices for all sorts of things, but we choose to spend the money on other things, and I wish we didn't, I wish we really didn't.' He finished his criticism of his party by adding: 'I don't like where we are, I wish it was different, but I hope we can see it differently going forward.'","Paul Gilbert jokes he hopes 'off-piste' remark will not get back to Miliband .

"The Middle East crisis deepened today as the US warned it will not 'stand by' while Iran supports rebels in Yemen. Secretary of State John Kerry said Washington would not accept foreign interference in the country in a direct criticism of Tehran's backing of Shiite Houthi fighters. It comes as a Saudi-led coalition continues to pound anti-government forces in Yemen at the start of a third week of bombing. Scroll down for video . US Secretary of State John Kerry has warned that the US will not 'stand by' while Iran supports rebels in Yemen . A member of the Saudi border guard is stationed at a look-out point on the Saudi-Yemeni border today. A Saudi-led coalition is continuing to pound anti-government forces in Yemen . Mr Kerry told PBS television: 'There have been - there are, obviously - flights coming from Iran. Every single week there are flights from Iran and we've traced it and know this. 'Iran needs to recognise that the United States is not going to stand by while the region is destabilised or while people engage in overt warfare across lines, international boundaries in other countries.' The United States has backed the Saudi-led campaign, which launched air strikes last month as the rebels advanced on Yemen's main southern city of Aden after seizing the capital Sanaa. President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi fled Aden for Saudi Arabia during the Houthi advance and the city has since seen heavy clashes between pro and anti-government forces. Riyadh has accused Tehran, the major Shiite power, of backing the rebels in a bid to establish a pro-Iran state on its doorstep. But Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif insisted his government wanted a swift end to the fighting, which has cost more than 640 lives since March 19, according to the World Health Organization. Military force: Saudi army tanks are seen deployed near the Saudi-Yemeni border, in southwestern Saudi Arabia . Patrol: Saudi guards drive tanks and armed vehicles along the border with Yemen . Mr Kerry, fresh from world powers striking a framework agreement with Iran on its nuclear programme, said Washington was not looking for confrontation with Tehran. 'But we're not going to step away from our alliances and our friendships and the need to stand with those who feel threatened as a consequence of the choices that Iran might be making.' In another sign of growing US support for the Saudi effort, the Pentagon said it had started daily aerial refuelling for warplanes in the coalition. The first refuelling flight took place on Tuesday night with a US Air Force KC-135 Stratotanker providing fuel for a F-15 fighter jet operated by Saudi Arabia and an F-16 flown by the United Arab Emirates, spokesman Colonel Steven Warren said. Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has warned that last week's  framework accord with world powers was no guarantee of a final nuclear deal. And President Hassan Rouhani said separately that the Islamic republic would not sign any final agreement unless 'all economic sanctions are totally lifted on the same day'. 'What has been done so far does not guarantee an agreement, nor its contents, nor even that the negotiations will continue to the end,' said Khamenei, who has the final word on all matters of state. After a week of gruelling last-ditch negotiations, Tehran and the six powers agreed on April 2 on the framework of a deal to be finalised by the end of June reining in Iran's nuclear programme in return for the lifting of international sanctions. 'Everything is in the detail, it may be that the other side, which is unfair, wants to limit our country in the details,' Khamenei said, in his first comments on the deal. Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has warned that last week's framework accord with world powers was no guarantee of a final nuclear deal . Playing down expectations of a deal after the interim accord - which sparked celebrations in the streets of Iranian cities - Khamenei said he had not taken any position until now as 'there is nothing to take a stance on'. 'Officials say that nothing has been done yet and there is nothing binding. I am neither for nor against.' Under the outline text agreed in the Swiss city of Lausanne between Tehran and the so-called P5+1 powers - the United States, Britain, China, France and Russia plus Germany - Iran must significantly reduce its number of centrifuges in exchange for a suspension of sanctions. The outline was a major breakthrough in a 12-year international crisis over Iran's nuclear programme. 'I have always supported and still support the Iranian negotiating team,' Khamenei said. 'I welcome any agreement that protects the interests and greatness of the nation, but having no agreement is more honourable than an agreement in which the interests and greatness of the nation is damaged.' Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said the Islamic republic would not sign any final agreement unless 'all economic sanctions are totally lifted on the same day' He said that retaining a civil nuclear industry in any agreement was vital for Iran's future development. 'The nuclear industry is a necessity, for energy production, for desalination, and in the fields of medicine, agriculture and other sectors,' he said. In a potential obstacle to any final deal, Rouhani said his country wanted sanctions lifted on the day of the implementation of any agreement. 'We will not sign any agreements unless on the first day of the implementation of the deal all economic sanctions are totally lifted on the same day,' he said. The pace at which the sanctions will be lifted is one of the outstanding issues that still has to be agreed in the final accord. Western governments, which have imposed their own sanctions over and above those adopted by the United Nations, have been pushing for it to happen only gradually. 'In return for Iran's future cooperation, we and our international partners will provide relief in phases from the sanctions that have impacted Iran's economy,' US Secretary of State John Kerry said last week. Rouhani, who was speaking on Iran's National Nuclear Technology Day, reiterated that his government remained determined to develop its civil nuclear programme. 'We will have a tanker sortie every day,' Warren said, adding that all flights will be outside of Yemeni air space. The air strikes killed at least 14 rebel fighters in Aden overnight Thursday at positions near the northern edge of the city, a source in pro-government forces told AFP. Air strikes also hit a military camp in the southern Shabwa province that was seized by the Houthis' main allies - security forces who have remained loyal to former strongman Ali Abdullah Saleh, a local official said. The official had no information on casualties among the forces loyal to Saleh, who has been accused of joining with the Houthis after being ousted from power in 2012 after an Arab Spring-inspired uprising. Yemen has been wracked by conflict since Saleh's ouster, with Hadi unable to assert government authority in a deeply tribal country riven by divisions. Supporters of the Shiite Houthi militia brandish their weapons in the Yemeni capital Sanaa. Washington has said it will not accept foreign interference in the country .

As well as the Houthis, who hail from Yemen's north, the government has struggled against Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), considered the most dangerous of the jihadist network's branches. Authorities in Yemen had for years allowed Washington to carry out a drone war against AQAP but US forces pulled out of the country amid the latest unrest. Al-Qaeda has taken advantage of the chaos to seize control of some areas and carried out a series of deadly attacks on both government forces and the Houthis. As the fighting and air campaign drag on, concern has been growing for what aid workers say is a mounting humanitarian crisis. Some aid trickled in to Aden by ship on Wednesday but efforts by the International Committee of the Red Cross to organise flights of cargo planes into Sanaa have so far failed. In Aden, witnesses have said the situation is dire, with bodies lying in the streets and mosques calling through loudspeakers for help. Smoke and flames rise from Shiite Houthi rebel camps following an airstrike by the Saudi-led allianceearlier this week .

Diplomatic efforts have stepped up to resolve the conflict, with the Iranian and Pakistani foreign ministers pledging to work to find a negotiated solution. Zarif laid out a four-stage plan for talks, calling for an immediate ceasefire followed by humanitarian assistance, dialogue among Yemenis and the formation of an 'all-inclusive government'. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was also quoted on Thursday as calling for a regional effort to end the fighting. 'The groups in Yemen should meet and work on possible solution. Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Iran should be involved in efforts for a diplomatic solution,' Erdogan was quoted as saying by Turkish media.","Secretary of State John Kerry hits out at Iran's support of Houthi fighters .

"A supporter waits the best part of an hour for five seconds with Ryan Taylor. There is a quick picture and good-luck message ahead of Sunday's Tyne-Wear derby. He is, evidently, one of the few players genuinely respected by Newcastle's disillusioned fans. Taylor scored the winner at the Stadium of Light three seasons ago, affording him a terrace tribute – 'Ryan Taylor, over the wall' – as well as a place in black-and-white folklore. But there is more to the Toon Army's admiration than one free-kick against the enemy. A working-class Scouser who came through the ranks at Tranmere and made 100 appearances by the time he was 21 before beating three career-threatening injuries, Taylor 'gets' the proud principles of the North East – appreciation, hard graft, honesty and enjoyment. He has himself been a fan in the crowd during three of the last four derby defeats - he watched the other from a hotel room in America after undergoing surgery on the second of the cruciate ligament injuries which kept him out for 26 months. Newcastle utility player Ryan Taylor (right) shields the ball from Arsenal forward Danny Welbeck . Taylor scores with a superb free-kick against Sunderland to win the game 1-0 at the Stadium of Light . Taylor is congratulated by Newcastle defender Steven Taylor  in the club's last victory over Sunderland . Newcastle supported him through that long rehabilitation, something for which Taylor will always be grateful. But with his current contract at St James' Park set to expire this summer, the 30-year-old does not know what the future holds. He would like to remain on Tyneside. He accepts, though, that this could be his final taste of the fixture which has guaranteed him lifelong worship. 'I have to be realistic, this could be my last derby,' he told Sportsmail. 'I don't want it to be, but that will be in my mind. So I'm not going to let it go the way of the last four - that cannot carry on. 'I've left the stadium gutted after every one of them and I've felt it like a fan. So we owe it to them now. 'I grew up with Liverpool and Everton, but that isn't as big because you live in the same house a lot of the time. 'So I'll be doing everything I can personally do to make sure we're up for it, because our performances in the last four just haven't been good enough.' Taylor returned after more than two years of painstaking gym sessions alone for October's 2-0 win at Manchester City in the League Cup. He was man-of-the-match and was greeted by a standing ovation in the dressing-room, where text messages from the likes of Steven Gerrard and Michael Owen awaited. Ninety minutes against the champions, however, had taken its toll. In the next game, at home to QPR, St James' was stunned into silence when, after half an hour, a tearful Taylor sat himself on the turf clutching the same ill-fated knee. Taylor's injury record at Newcastle has severely limited his first-team appearances over the past few years . The 30-year-old is incredibly grateful to Newcastle for sticking by him and hopes to repay them on Sunday . 'I thought to myself, 'Why me?',' he reflects. 'You start doubting whether the knee will ever be strong enough. I was thinking, 'What have I skipped? What have I done wrong?'. 'Within an hour of the game I'd had a scan and the cruciate was fine, relief isn't the word. I'd probably got through the City game on pure adrenaline. So I think it was my body telling me just take your time. 'I won't lie, the fact I'm out of contract was on my mind and I wanted to be back sooner than the three months it took. 'Every game felt like another game off my career. But we did what was right and now there are no problems at all. 'I'll admit there were times when I thought I couldn't do it and my old man just told me 'no'. 'So when you've had the tears and those dark days, you appreciate every minute.' On the subject of dark days, both Newcastle and Sunderland are horribly out of form going into what has been billed as 'The Desperation Derby'. The Black Cats could be in the relegation zone by the time kick-off arrives, while Newcastle have lost their last three under John Carver. To suffer another loss in the derby could prove unforgivable in the eyes of supporters whose last victory arrived courtesy of Taylor's right boot in August, 2011. 'The good thing is we've got a cracking game now and if anything can rally us for the rest of the season then this is it,' says Taylor, who will start at right back. 'To be on a winning team on the ground where it all started for me would make everything worthwhile, all of the hard work and long days during those two years. 'But I remember that day so well. It was my first derby. I've played in two now and I'm yet to lose. 'Jonas (Gutierrez) won a foul just on the corner of the box. My first Premier League goal – for Wigan against Newcastle – was from that exact position, so I fancied it. 'I remember seeing Simon Mignolet edging out, almost inviting me to put it in the top corner. That's what I did. Steven Taylor tried to claim it, but he was nowhere near it. He tried to celebrate my goal by himself! 'I knew my dad and brother were in the away end celebrating and I just thought, 'Wow. They will be having some time in there'. Taylor is one of the most popular players at Newcastle for his consistent and hard working performances . 'Dan Gosling – one of my best mates – went through on goal in the last minute. Looking back, I'm probably relieved he didn't score to make it 2-0! 'I didn't realise at the time how big scoring the winner was and how much I would be remembered for just one goal. 'It'll be amazing if I'm coming back here in 10 years' time with my two boys and they're still singing that song.' Taylor adds: 'I'll always be a Newcastle fan. This club has been brilliant with me. I could have been the forgotten man but they stuck by me. 'Now I need to show them that I can stay fit. I've had some terrible luck, but I'd like to think I've got a lot left in me. 'So this final part of the season is massive for me – I would love to stay here.' And with that the supporter has his photo. 'What's going to happen on Sunday?' Taylor is asked. '1-0. Ryan Taylor. Over the wall,' he laughs. You can see why they like him in these parts. Taylor is out of contract at the end of the season and admits he does not know what the future has in store .","Ryan Taylor's injury record has severely limited the number of first-team appearances he has made for Newcastle .
Still, the 30-year-old utility player is one of the most popular at the club .
Taylor etched himself into Newcastle folklore in 2011 by scoring the winner with a superb free-kick against rivals Sunderland .
He is out of contract in the summer and Sunday's fixture at the Stadium of Light could be his last derby in a Newcastle shirt .",2c74e9cf11f6b11d160d42bd140b0e9d17173391
"A body found in the Mississippi River over the weekend has been identified as Minnesota fourth-grader Barway Edwin Collins who has been missing for nearly four weeks. Authorities said the body of the ten-year-old was found on Saturday around 1pm by searchers from a Boy Scout troop - about ten feet from the river's edge in Brooklyn Center. Crystal Police Chief Stephanie Revering said authorities have electronic evidence that shows the boy's father, Pierre Collins, 33, was in that area at the time the boy disappeared. However, she did not elaborate on the nature of that evidence. Police said on Sunday that the boy's father is a primary suspect as the case becomes a homicide investigation. A body pulled from the Mississippi River on Saturday has been identified as Barway Edward Collins (above), 10, who has been missing for nearly a month . Crystal Police Chief Stephanie Revering said authorities have electronic evidence that reveals that the boy's father, Pierre Collins, was in that area at the time he disappeared (above Revering during a news conference on April 12, 2015 in Crystal, Minnesota) Barway's father, 33-year-old Pierre Collins (pictured left as he stands with his wife, Yamah, during a vigil held for his son last month) is a primary suspect in the homicide investigation involving his son . 'This location is consistent with our knowledge of Pierre Collin's activities on March 18 and he remains a primary suspect,' said Revering. The Hennepin County Medical Examiner said the cause and manner of Barway's death are still being investigated. The case is being considered a homicide based on the autopsy and information from the medical examiner, said Revering. A report last month by Fox 9 said that according to sources, Pierre Collins, took out a life insurance policy in Barway's name totaling $30,000 not long before the child went missing. The boy's father, who has said he is innocent, has not been arrested or charged in relation to the incident, but Revering said authorities have his passport to ensure he stays in the country. Police were stationed at his apartment complex for his own protection after reports of death threats. On Sunday, Pastor Harding Smith, of the Spiritual Church of God who has been acting as the family's spokesman said when the family received the news, there were a lot of tears, according to Twin Cities. 'There were lots of tears and lots of screams,' he said. 'There was disbelief, hurt, sadness. There is a deep sense of loss when you enter that home.' Alexander Collins, executive director of the Liberian Ministry Association, said: 'We also want to make clear to the perpetrator of this tragedy, that wherever you are, you will be found. This evil will be found. 'Wherever you are hiding, under a car, underground, make no mistake our community does not abide this evil.' The Hennepin County Medical Examiner said the cause and manner of Barway's death are still being investigated . Barway, who was a student at Evergreen Park World Cultures Community School, was last seen after school last month. In video released by police (scenes from footage above), Barway says 'there's my dad' and 'there's my uncle' In a March 25 interview with the Star Tribune, Pierre Collins said he was not home when his son disappeared and he was upset to be considered a suspect. 'I've been working with the police just to bring my son home,' he told the newspaper. 'I will do whatever they want just so Barway can come home. I have nothing to do with Barway's missing.' His wife and Barway's stepmother, Yamah Collins, also said she and her husband did not know who took the boy, and they pleaded for his safe return. Pierre Collins (right), accompanied by Pastor Harding Smith (center), the family's spokesman, was interviewed by Nancy Grace last month, saying that he failed the polygraph test because he was very emotional . Police said on Sunday that the boy's father (above) is a 'primary suspect' as the case becomes a homicide investigation . Police released a video of Barway riding a bus after school. In the video, the boy said 'there's my dad' and 'there's my uncle.' 'The father and the party described as an 'uncle' are likely the last known people to have seen Barway,' Revering said, as reported by the Star-Tribune. 'Unfortunately, we have reason to believe that Barway's father has not been completely truthful with us.' Addressing the footage on the bus, Pierre Collins explained to Nancy Grace that in the Liberian community, children commonly refer to adults as 'uncle' or 'auntie.' When pressed by Grace about the failed polygraph test, Collins explained that he was 'very emotional' during the test. 'I wasn't...myself when I took the polygraph,' he said. The boy was reported missing by his father at around 6.30pm on March 18 after the child failed to come home from school (above a massive billboard featuring a missing ad for Barway) Barway, who was a student at Evergreen Park World Cultures Community School, was last seen after school last month. The boy was reported missing by his father at around 6.30pm on March 18 after the child failed to come home from school. A call to the school bus company revealed that the 10-year-old was dropped off outside his building at around 4.15pm. Video surveillance from his apartment complex shows he was about to go inside, but then turned around as if he was called over to the parking lot by someone he knew, and he walked away, police said last month.

A young boy adds a donation for Barway Collins' family to the pile during the vigil last month . The family told the Star Tribune that Barway emigrated from his home country of Liberia, where his mother lives, to stay with his father in 2011. The father said he wanted 'to make him better' and for Barway to eventually go to college. While looking for Barway, local police, federal agents and Hennepin County's sheriff's deputies searched the area with K-9 dogs, reviewing footage from surveillance cameras and interviewing family members and witnesses.","Barway Edwin Collins, 10, went missing from his Crystal, Minnesota apartment complex March 18 after school .

"Militants fighting for the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq are being led by a highly secretive group of strategists and officials that were once senior figures in Saddam Hussein's army. Despite thousands of foreign fighters flocking to join the Sunni extremist group and starring in their propaganda videos, ISIS' leadership is dominated by ex-members of the late Iraqi dictator's military. Almost all of the regional commanders appointed by ISIS' leader and self-declared caliph, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, played prominent roles in the Baathist army before the 2003 invasion of Iraq and became involved with ISIS either in the resulting insurgency or after the dictator's 2006 execution. Influence: Despite thousands of foreign fighters flocking to join the Sunni extremist group and starring in their propaganda videos, ISIS' leadership is dominated by ex-members of the military of Saddam Hussein (pictured) Militants: Almost all the highly secretive officials overseeing the day-to-day running of the Islamic State (pictured) are former members of Saddam Hussein's Baathist army . One of the most prominent former Iraqi Army generals within ISIS was Abu Muslim al-Turkmani (left) who led the terrorists' operations in Iraq until he was killed in an American airstrike last November. Abu Ayman al-Iraqi (right), a former colonel in Iraqi Air Force intelligence now plays a leading role in ISIS' military council . One former Syrian rebel who became an ISIS regional commander told the Washington Post that he found that almost all of the highly secretive officials overseeing all aspects to the terror group's day-to-day business were ex members of Hussein's Baathist army. During one meeting in which he dared to disagree with fellow commanders at an ISIS meeting, the man calling himself Abu Hamza was placed under arrest on the orders of a masked man who had sat silently and almost unnoticed at the side of the room, listening and taking notes. Although the enigmatic commander's real name was never revealed to him, Hamza said that he later discovered that the man had been an intelligence officer for the Iraqi army before joining ISIS. The same went for the other ISIS commanders Hamza met, who either used code names or no names at all in the hope of concealing their past as members of Hussein's army. As well as their extensive military expertise, another key element of the commanders' appointments has been the fact the ex-Baathists have extensive contacts among oil smugglers thanks to Hussein's efforts to avoid international sanctions in the 1990s. Crucially, oil smuggling is considered the most lucrative aspect of ISIS' £2 billion-a-year income. Leader: Almost all of the regional commanders appointed by ISIS' leader and self-declared caliph, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured), played prominent roles in the Baathist army before the 2003 invasion of Iraq . Experience: Former Iraqi Army colonel Haji Bakr (left) was al-Baghdadi's closest advisor and the overall head of his military council until his execution at the hands of Syrian rebels in January 2014. Pictured right is Abu Ahmad al-Alwani - a former Baathist soldier and now an ISIS military council member . The former Iraqi Army generals' connections with oil smugglers are crucial to ISIS' £2 billion-a-year income . Middle East analysts and experts believe one key reason why so many former Iraqi army commanders have joined ISIS is due to the de-Baathification law brought in L.­ Paul Bremer - the American who served as temporary head of the Iraqi state following the ousting of Hussein. The law effectively meant that 400,000 members of the defeated Iraqi army could no longer be employed in government roles and were barred from drawing their military pensions. Many of these highly-trained commanders joined the insurgency in the country in the mid-2000s, which was dominated by ISIS who at the time were known by the name Al Qaeda in Iraq. When al-Baghdadi took control of the group in 2010, many of these commanders were given prominent leadership roles in the hope they might win the support of the Sunni tribes who dominate Western Iraq and who have been largely ignored by the country's Shia-led Baghdad government. The process had, however been started by al-Baghdadi's predecessor Abu Omar al-Baghdadi who was himself a former Iraqi Army officer and therefore more trusted by the military than the Jordanian criminal, former gangster and ex-alcoholic who founded ISIS, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Past: The process of giving former Iraqi commanders senior roles was started by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's predecessor Abu Omar al-Baghdadi (left) who was a former Iraqi Army officer and therefore more trusted than the Jordanian criminal, former gangster and ex-alcoholic who founded ISIS, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi (right) Heartbreaking: The highest estimate for the number of recruits killed in the Speicher massacre is about 1,700 . Discovery: The graves were found last Wednesday on the late Saddam Hussein's presidential compound . One of the most prominent former Iraqi Army generals within ISIS was Fadel Ahmad Abdullah al-Hiyali, who used the code name Abu Muslim al-Turkmani, and was in charge of all the terrorists' operations in Iraq until he was killed in an American airstrike last November. He had previously been a colonel in military intelligence and served in Hussein's Republican Guard. Other senior figures include Abu Ali al-Anbari, who currently acts as Baghdadi's deputy leader in Syria and is a former military general in Hussein's Iraqi Army, and Abu Ayman al-Iraqi, a former colonel in Iraqi Air Force intelligence and now plays a leading role in ISIS' military council. Less prominent militants with an Iraqi Army backgrounds include Abu Ahmad al-Alwani - a former Baathist soldier and now an ISIS military council member, Abu Kassem - a former Iraqi officer and now in charge of ISIS suicide bombers and foreign fighters. Another former Iraqi Army colonel was Haji Bakr, who is widely considered to have been al-Baghdadi's closest advisor and the overall head of his military council until his execution at the hands of a rebel group known as the Syrian Martyr's Brigade in January 2014. It is widely believed that all of the senior ISIS figures killed over the past year - including Haji Bakr - have been replaced by former members of the Iraqi Army. Horror: Images like this one of the soldiers being led through Tikrit shocked Iraq and the world . This morning Iraqi forensic teams in the newly liberated city of Tikrit have started exhuming bodies from mass graves believed to contain some of the hundreds of soldiers killed by ISIS last year. Kamil Amin, from Iraq's Human Rights Ministry, said the work on eight locations started yesterday inside Tikrit's complex of presidential palaces, where much of the killing is thought to have occured. ISIS overran Saddam Hussein's hometown last June, capturing around 1,700 soldiers as they were trying to flee Camp Speicher, an air base previously used by U.S. troops on the outskirt of Tikrit. The fall of Tikrit was part of the ISIS onslaught that stunned Iraqi security forces and the military, which melted away as the militants advanced and captured key cities and towns in the country's north and west. Later, ISIS group posted graphic images online that showed gunmen massacring scores of the soldiers after forcing them to lay face-down in a ditch with their arms tied behind their backs. After weeks of bitter clashes, Iraqi forces and allied Shiite militias, succeeded in retaking Tikrit from ISIS. Their victory was helped by U.S.-led coalition airstrikes.","ISIS leadership is dominated by former members of Hussein's Iraqi Army .

"Two teenage girls were savagely beaten by a crowd of people, including parents and other adults, in a New Jersey park as onlookers videotaped the riot and encouraged the violence to continue. Destiny Cooke, 16, and Lajahia Cooke, 17, were brutally kicked, punched, stomped and shoved around by the mob, who can be heard laughing during the five-minute video filmed in Trenton. Lajahia said one girl ripped out her earring out before the girl's mother threw a rock at her ear, leaving a gash that required 12 stitches. Scroll down for video . Sisters Destiny Cooke, 16, and Lajahia Cooke, 17, were brutally kicked, punched, stomped and shovedy a crowd of people, including grown adults and parents, in a park in Trenton, New Jersey . People can be heard laughing throughout the video and chanting 'they gettin' busy!' or 'let her get her!' And Destiny has been left with a bald spot after someone grabbed a chunk of her hair. Throughout the video various people hold the girls down so that others can punch them over and over again. One guy can be heard gleefully screaming 'they gettin' busy!' At one point, according to ABC 7, someone tries to break up the fight but an adult is determined to let it continue, screaming 'let her get her!' But perhaps the most disturbing part of the video is when, while Destiny is on the ground, her skirt rides up and men proceed to laugh and take pictures, one even exclaiming 'somebody smack that!' Destiny said she was play fighting with her friend at the park on a nice day during spring break last Monday before the riot broke out. She said people saw her and her friend and got the wrong idea. They came back with a crowd of people who, she said, were looking for a fight. When Lajahia tried to step in and help Destiny, all hell broke loose. 'It just escalated from there,' Destiny told NJ.com. 'Just like a riot broke out, they just started hitting us.' Destiny said she called her mother and asked her to pick the girls, telling her there were 'grown women' walking up to the sisters. That's when then the 16-year-old first got hit, causing her to drop her phone. 'I just had to defend myself,' she told MY 9 NJ. The girls said they saw multiple police cars at the park as they left. Destiny said no one got out to offer the girls any help, even as Destiny's nose was bleeding. Destiny (pictured) has been left with a bald spot after people pulled on her hair throughout the fight . Lajahia said one girl ripped an earring out of her ear, and then the girl's mother threw a rock at her ear, leaving a gash that required 12 stitches . 'They just stayed in their cars and just looked at us,' Destiny said. 'I just felt like we were out there by ourselves and there were people stomping us on our head,' she told NJ.com. 'Nobody was out there trying to help us - nobody.' According to police spokesman Lt. Stephen Varn, patrol officers received a 911 call for a reported street fight. Two patrol units arrived at the scene of the brawl and reported that no other police officers were needed. Trenton Mayor Eric Jackson released a statement saying he was angered 'by the lack of good Samaritans who should have stepped forward to come to the aid of these victims'. A park ranger has since been installed to monitor Greg Grant Park. Police Captain Eddie Gonzalez called the video 'sickening' and said the department had identified 'a number of individuals that were a part of this'. 'We will take swift action with them very, very shortly,' he said. 'Warrants will be issued in the very near future.'

"Gemma Redhead was left terrified after her former partner telephoned her after he was released from prison, following a conviction for raping her . Brutally raped at knifepoint and left fearing for her life, Gemma Redhead believed her ordeal was over after her attacker was jailed. But as she attempted to rebuild her life, the young mother had a sickening reminder of the attack – from the man who carried it out. After he was released from prison, having served only half his sentence, he defied a restraining order to phone her. Miss Redhead said the 46-second call ‘reawakened all of the fear and terror of the attack’, leaving her unable to sleep or eat. ‘As soon as I heard his voice I realised who it was, and it disturbed something deep down inside of me,’ she said. Miss Redhead, 33, who has waived her right to anonymity, was left with post-traumatic stress disorder after being repeatedly raped by her former partner, Philip Kirby. She endured eight years of violence at the hands of bullying Kirby and his attacks became so brutal she lived in fear every day, thinking he would kill her. In August 2010 the mother-of-four, who has a child with Kirby, decided to break up with him. After they separated, Kirby, 32, refused to acknowledge the end of their relationship and begged Miss Redhead to take him back. He continued to harass her and eventually forced his way into her home before subjecting her to a harrowing ordeal. After the first horrifying attack, Miss Redhead begged him to leave, but he told her: ‘I’m already going to jail for a long time so what difference does it make?’ before raping her again. Kirby, of Newcastle, initially denied rape. But on the first day of his trial he changed his plea, admitting four counts of rape. In April 2011, he was jailed for eight years with a five-year extended licence period. He was also handed a restraining order which banned any contact with Miss Redhead for the rest of her life. Meanwhile she began counselling, including cognitive therapy, and medication to help her overcome her post-traumatic stress disorder. But she says her hopes of rebuilding her life have now been shattered. She said: ‘It is a daily struggle and an ongoing battle to deal with this. After his initial arrest I was hopeful for the future and felt free and that I could begin to rebuild my life. Philip Kirby had been sentenced to eight years in prison but was released after three years, and phoned his former partner. The rapist had been banned from contacting her for life and will now not be released until 2023 . ‘I now feel it will never be so and he will not leave me alone.’ Referring to the chilling phonecall, Miss Redhead added: ‘But at the same time I was not surprised. I had always felt as though he would come after me once he was released.’ She said Kirby had tried to ‘destroy’ her and she feared he would continue to harass her for the rest of her life. ‘We tried so hard to rebuild our lives after he virtually destroyed it,’ she said. ‘He will never leave us alone. We just can’t escape him. We feel trapped by his behaviour. Why can’t he just leave us alone to get on with our lives? I just want my family to be left in peace.’ Miss Redhead described herself as being in an ‘extreme state of anxiety’ since the phone call from Kirby. She said: ‘I will no longer go outside on my own. I can’t eat or sleep and when I do sleep I have constant nightmares and flashbacks. I am really scared. Ms Redhead was left with post traumatic stress disorder after the attack. She is pictured (above) with Kirby during their relationship . ‘Despite telling probation he wouldn’t contact me, he has. Prison has not been a deterrent for him. I feel very fearful of what he would do next. ‘I am still full of fear. I would like to be free of fear and not constantly worrying about his next release date.’ After the phone call Kirby was hauled back to court and he admitted breaching his restraining order. On Friday, Newcastle Crown Court heard that Kirby was released from prison in November last year and after drinking vodka he decided to contact his victim last month. He was sentenced to a further six months and will not be released until 2023, serving his full jail term. Judge Deborah Sherwin said: ‘What makes this matter particularly bad is the effect she suffered at your hands originally. ‘It is not part of my function to sentence you again in respect of that but it is the legacy of that, that she feels vulnerable and afraid, therefore any phone calls made by you would have a greater effect on her than they might do to any other person.’","Philip Kirby was jailed for eight years in 2011 for raping Gemma Redhead .

"Keeping David de Gea at the club would be the biggest signing Manchester United could make this summer, says Phil Neville. The Spanish keeper has impressed for Louis van Gaal's side this season and has heavily been linked with a move to Real Madrid, who are looking for a long-term replacement for Iker Casillas. United have been linked with their own big-money moves for the likes of Gareth Bale and Mats Hummels, but Neville believes the club must concentrate on keeping De Gea at Old Trafford. David de Gea met Man United fans earlier in the week as part of a day organised by the club's foundation . De Gea punches the ball away during Manchester United's 1-0 defeat to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge . 'The biggest thing is David De Gea, and keeping him at the football club,' Neville told the Manchester Evening News.

"A Michigan father convicted of abusing his then-11-week-old daughter who might lose parental rights to his only child claims his baby was never abused. Joshua Quincy Burns, formerly of Brighton, was sentenced to three years' probation with the first served in Livingston County Jail for second-degree child abuse earlier this month. Joshua Burns and and his wife, Brenda Burns, say he is innocent, and that he grabbed their daughter Naomi's face when she slipped from his lap as he ended a phone call with his wife in March 2014. He claims he was trying to save her from hitting her head on a coffee table in their home. His now-one-year-old daughter suffered several injuries, including seizures, hypothermia, hypotension, bradycardia, apnea and retinal hemorrhages. But the couple call it 'an accident', not child abuse. Scroll down for video . Joshua Burns (right) was sentenced to three years' probation with the first served in Livingston County Jail for second-degree child abuse after his daughter Naomi (in his arms) suffered several injuries. He and his wife Brenda Burns (left) maintain Joshua Burns's innocence . Brenda Burns has refused to allow social workers and Michigan's Department of Human Services to see Naomi, according to the Livingston Daily. She was not charged criminally in the case, and a civil jury - when the state was seeking to end parental rights - found Brenda Burns not accountable for Naomi's injuries. The couple started a website called TornFamily in hopes of raising awareness of their situation and reunite their family. They will also be sharing their story on an episode of Dr Phil on Monday, and Joshua Burns maintains his innocence throughout the episode. 'I never abused my daughter,' he claims in the preview for the show. Joshua Burns claims he never abused little Naomi, and she suffered injuries after she slipped off his lap while he was ending a phone call with his wife and in an attempt to save his daughter from hitting her head on a coffee table he grabbed her by the face . Brenda Burns (right) has fled from Michigan to Colorado with Naomi in an attempt to escape being watched by DHS. Their oversight has been put on hold until a June hearing where Joshua Burns's parental rights will be determined . After the incident, baby Naomi suffered several injuries, including seizures, hypothermia, hypotension, bradycardia, apnea and retinal hemorrhages . 'Then why are you in jail?' Dr Phil asks in return. Brenda Burns claims that a Child Protective Services worker and five police officers entered their home and searched her house when the incident occurred. 'I literally thought: Do you have the right family?' she said to Dr Phil. Brenda Burns's attorney Elizabeth Warner said that the mother has the right to not be monitored by the government, and 'certainly not by the agency that takes children' because she was not held responsible for the injuries and is seen as 'the fit parent' Earlier this month, Judge Miriam Cavanaugh said the DHS's supervision of Naomi would continue but is on hold pending the decision as to whether or not Joshua Burns will continue to have parental rights, according to the Free Press. Joshua Burns continues to claim he's innocent. In an episode of Dr Phil airing Monday, he says, 'I never abused my daughter' Even though her husband has been jailed, Brenda Burns supports her husband and agrees that the incident was 'an accident', not child abuse . Brenda Burns fled to Colorado to avoid being watched DHS, which she believes is unconstitutional. Naomi's court-appointed attorney has reportedly seen the child and says told the Livingston County Circuit Court that the baby is doing well. Warner, Brenda Burns's attorney, said that Naomi is 'doing very well' and that 'she's pretty advanced for her age'. She said: 'You can see pictures of a sick child with tubes in them and think she's going to be brain damaged forever. 'In fact, if this was a misdiagnosis as we think it was, I think the fact Naomi is so well really supports the parents' position this wasn't abuse. It was a misdiagnoses by a doctor. 'It's something she recovered from.' The hearing over the potential termination of Joshua Burns's parental rights is in June.

"Many people might think that trust issues, long distances and cheating scandals are the biggest strains on a relationship. But they are wrong. It's IKEA. A psychology expert has confirmed that shopping at or assembling furniture from the Scandinavian store chain can be a serious source of friction between a couple, thanks to the high levels of stress caused by both activities. 'The store literally becomes a map of a relationship nightmare,' Ramani Durvasula, a clinical psychologist in Santa Monica, California, told The Wall Street Journal. Scroll down for video . Can your relationship handle it? Experts say that shopping at IKEA can cause serious friction between couples - and assembling the store's wares makes it even worse . 'Walking through the kitchens brings up touchy subjects, like who does most of the cooking. Then you get to the children’s section, which opens up another set of issues. And that’s before you've even tried assembling anything,' she said. Ramani revealed that so many couples admitted to her that they were prone to fighting while assembling furniture, that she decided to include furniture assembly in her therapy sessions. And her couples are not alone; a report by CivicScience states that 17 per cent of couples confessed that they would argue every time they assembled furniture together, and therapists reported to WSJ that couples who are able to successfully assemble furniture together as a team actually have a healthier relationship. 'The Divorcemaker': This Liatorp home entertainment unit requires two people for assembly and involves putting together a large amount of shelving . Shopping for trouble: Clinical psychologist Ramani Durvasula brings furniture assembly into therapy sessions after so many couples described fighting while putting together IKEA items . Getting into particulars, Ramani explained that the more complicated the assembly, the more likely your new IKEA buy will leave you and your partner at odds. She revealed that a smaller unit like a Nornäs coffee table won't put too many demands on your relationship, but it's a different story for a large wall unit like the $1,199 Liatorp unit, which Ramani has dubbed 'The Divorcemaker'. The description of the item on IKEA's website includes a lengthy 'Good To Know' section outlining the different ways you can mess up the unit's assembly, saying that you need two people to put it together. 'Handle with care!' it reads. 'A damaged edge or scratched surface can in exceptional cases cause the glass to crack suddenly. However, never into sharp fragments, only into small pieces. Avoid collisions from the side - this is where the glass is most vulnerable.' Its relationship-ruining qualities don't seem to be doing the the home furnishings giant any harm however, as it has 298 stores in 26 countries, and boasts a revenue of more than $36 billion a year. As for how to avoid having the dreaded 'IKEA meltdown' with your partner, Janice Simonsen, design spokesperson for IKEA US, recommends to WSJ that you agree on a style before walking into the store.","A psychology expert has revealed that the stress of a visit to the store can cause serious friction between couples .
She warned that customers avoid one particular unit known as the Liatorp, which retails for $1,199 and is notoriously tricky to build .",d0ee59002d2772aea6d1fef63ef2153f11cff02f

"Claudia Martin, 33, has been convicted of suffocating her newborn baby daughter . A mother-of-five has been convicted of killing her newborn baby girl by filling her mouth with toilet paper and hiding her body in a suitcase. Claudia Martins gave birth alone at her sister's flat having kept her pregnancy secret from her family and friends. Paramedics were called after the 33-year-old, a Portuguese national, was found sitting in the bath with 'a lot of blood' and she was taken to hospital. Earlier she had killed the infant by stuffing toilet paper down its throat. She then wrapped the baby girl in towels and a plastic bag and hid the body in a suitcase - where it lay undiscovered for three days. Martins was acquitted by a jury of a single charge of murder but convicted of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility. During her trial at Bristol Crown Court the jury was told she gave birth alone at her sister's flat in Knowle, Bristol on September 12 last year. Adam Vaitilingam QC, prosecuting, said: 'She told no-one of her pregnancy and gave birth in as secretive a way as she could, for someone living in a crowded flat, and kept the fact of that birth secret from all those around her and closest to her, including her sister. 'She placed the body of the baby in a suitcase, hidden from anyone. 'No doubt, we suggest she intended to dispose of it but was prevented from doing so by the arrival of the paramedics, who took her off to hospital.' Two days later, her sister Vilma raised the alarm after noticing a smell coming from a suitcase in the defendant's bedroom. Police were called to the flat and discovered the body of a newborn baby inside Martins' small, black suitcase, on September 15. Martins, described as having an extremely low IQ, was arrested and admitted she had given birth but said the baby was stillborn. A post-mortem examination found a wad of toilet paper inside the baby's mouth, which experts claim was 'deliberately inserted'. The jury heard Martins is originally from Mozambique in Africa but moved to Portugal before settling in Bristol in 2011, living in a two-bedroom flat with her sister Vilma Marshall, Ms Marshall's partner, and five children. Giving evidence, Martins told the court: 'I did not kill my daughter. I did not put tissue paper in her throat. I didn't kill her. No, I did not kill my daughter.' Mr Justice Teare remanded Martins, of Marshall Walk, Knowle, Bristol into custody to await the preparation of reports. She will be sentenced at a later date. Detective Inspector Neil Meade, of Avon and Somerset Police, said: 'The death of a baby is always a tragedy but the unique circumstances make this a particularly emotive case for everyone involved. 'We carried out a sensitive and comprehensive investigation into the circumstances of the baby girl's death and obtained statements from medical experts specialising in this field. 'We've also worked closely with the Crown Prosecution Service from the outset. The jury has listened to the evidence and convicted Claudia Martins of manslaughter. 'Our thoughts are very much with the victim's wider family as they are struggling to comprehend how and why this tragedy happened.'

"Her brother-in-law has led a personal crusade against poaching and protecting vulnerable wildlife. So Pippa Middleton’s decision to enjoy a plate of whale meat on holiday may have been rather difficult for Prince William to swallow. The 31-year-old, who styles herself as a food and lifestyle writer, has told of eating Minke whale – even though it is largely banned worldwide. She boasted of tucking into the delicacy in Norway, to the horror of environmental campaigners who say she is helping promote an ‘unimaginably cruel’ trade. Scroll down for video . Pippa Middleton has been slammed for ‘promoting the cruel and unnecessary whaling industry’. She's pictured here at the 2014 GQ Men Of The Year awards in London . In a gushing newspaper feature, the Duchess of Cambridge’s younger sister described how the smoked meat was served in a ‘wonderfully convivial atmosphere’ at the Juvet Landscape Hotel in north-west Norway. Tucking into a starter prepared carpaccio-style – raw and very thinly sliced – she wrote: ‘We dined on smoked whale carpaccio (which tastes similar to smoked salmon but looks more like venison carpaccio).’ Ms Middleton said that she ate whale carpaccio in a 'convivial atmosphere on a large communal table' Earlier she had enjoyed a steam bath and rubbed ice on her body in a ‘snow spa’ at the upmarket hotel, where she spent the night in a £170-a-night ‘designer pod’. The hunting and importation of whale meat is banned in Britain, as it is in most parts of the world, by both the International Whaling Commission and by the international wildlife convention CITES. But Norway – as well as Japan and Iceland – has exploited legal loopholes that allow it to opt out of regulations. Last year it killed around 730 Minke whales, the highest number since it broke the moratorium on commercial whaling in 1993. Campaigners have long called for a crackdown, arguing the hunting process is ‘unimaginably cruel and inhumane’. The socialite, writing in the Daily Telegraph, said that she ate whale at the £123-a-night Juvet Landscape Hotel (pictured) Ms Middleton said that the dinner was cooked by Knut, the hotel’s owner. The Duchess of Cambridge's sister said that the establishment was an 'architectural gem' Pippa Middleton would be breaking British law if she had tucked into the whale meat in the UK. Britain has signed up to the International Whaling Commission, which makes it illegal to import or eat whale meat in this country. Whaling is also prohibited under EU law, but Norway is not a member of the EU. Last season, 731 minke whales were killed in Norway off the country’s northern coasts. The whaling season runs from April to August, when they are hunted from boats using grenade-propelled harpoons, which are shot from cannons into the whale’s chest. In the 1960s and 70s whale meat was commonly served in Norwegian school canteens and as part of military rations. It then fell out of favour, but has recently been adopted as a gourmet food trend. Fish market manager Marius Tvethaug said: ‘Smoked whale is one of the oldest ways to keep food for a long time. And we’ve been catching whale since the Stone Age. I would say it’s kind of back to our roots.’ Even with modern harpoons powered by explosives, the mammals often died a ‘slow and painful’ death. Critics said Miss Middleton’s decision to eat whale meat was at odds with the stance taken by Prince William – even though he too has been attacked for continuing to hunt wild game. She has also been photographed hunting in the past. Vanessa Williams-Grey, of Whale and Dolphin Conservation, said: ‘It might have been better for Pippa to take a whale watch trip in Norway. She might then have thought twice about condoning and indeed, promoting, this cruel and unnecessary trade.’ Philip Mansbridge, UK director of the International Fund for Animal Welfare, said she was ‘unwittingly setting a bad example’ that may encourage other tourists. A spokesman for Miss Middleton, who travelled on the junket for the Daily Telegraph, refused to comment last night. But Knut Slinning, owner of Juvet Landscape Hotel, said he had no plans to stop serving whale meat because it has been eaten for ‘many hundreds of years’. However, Siri Martinsen, of Norway’s animals rights group NOAH, said Miss Middleton has a ‘special responsibility’ not to support animal cruelty. Last year 731 minke whales suffered an agonising death at the hand of Norwegian whalers, according to WDC. Pictured is a minke whale on the deck of a Japanese vessel . Three Greenpeace inflatables  interrupt whaling on board the Norwegian whaling vessel Kato in the Southern whaling grounds in the North Sea .

"BBC presenter Charlie Stayt has been blasted after he misspelt the word 'education' during a live report on the issue.

Back to school: Eagle-eyed viewers spotted Charlie Stayt's embarrassing spelling error during a live broadcast . The presenter left out the letter 'c' when he wrote the word for the third time on the whiteboard this morning .

Whilst Mike Knowles tweeted: 'If you're presenting a live report about education on #BBCBreakfast maybe double check how you spell education.' Viewer John Morley added: 'Fantastic, #bbcbreakfast presenter can't spell education.' Crafty Monkey wrote: '@BBCBreakfast C-!! Could do better!' Afterwards, Bill Turnbull told Stayt he had started a Twitter frenzy and made him spell out the word education live on air. He said: 'There we go, it was a typo, we'll forgive him.' Presenter Sally Nugent added: 'I don't think that spelling mistake was that bad.' Stayt said: 'Let's just call it one of those things.' But Turnbull added: 'You've only caused a Twitter frenzy in two-and-a-half minutes.' Nugent said: 'I don't think anyone's noticed.'

Afterwards, colleague Bill Turnbull made red-faced Stayt spell the word 'education' US politician Dan Quayle was mocked when he misspelt the word 'potato' on a school blackboard on June 15, 1992 when he was visiting a school in Trenton as part of his official duties. He took part in a spelling bee when students had to write words on a blackboard. When it was 12-year-old William Figueroa's turn he had to write the word 'potato'. But Quayle pointed out: 'You're close, but you left a little something off. The e on the end'. In December last year, police in South Yorkshire were left embarrassed after taking delivery of a new patrol car with POLCE emblazoned on the side.

"'Boring' has been the word on everyone's lips when talking about Chelsea this week, but Didier Drogba has shown he and his team-mates still have the skill to disprove that disparaging tag. The Blues are preparing for Wednesday night's trip to Leicester City at St George's Park, having drawn criticism for the way they ground out a decisive 0-0 draw against Arsenal on Sunday. And Drogba and his team-mates, who can wrap up the Barclays Premier League title with two more victories, have shown off their abilities with an intricate six-man heading trick around the dinner table. Didier Drogba hit back at claims that Chelsea were boring with a video of them completing a 'bin challenge' After the ball is headed by Loic Remy and Eden Hazard, John Terry heads to Drogba in the six-man task . After Drogba, goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois is the next to take the ball, heading back to John Obi Mikel . Mikel stoops with a diving header that sees him fall off his chair, but the ball does drop into the small bin . Manager Jose Mourinho shot back at claims that his side were boring this week, insisting that going 10 years without winning the league - as Arsenal have - was more boring, and now Drogba has added to the retort with a video captioned: 'Boring boring chelseaaaa!!!!!!' With six players seated opposite each other on either side of a long table, Branislav Ivanovic throws the ball on to the head of Loic Remy to start the game. He heads back to Eden Hazard, who then directs it on to John Terry followed by Drogba and Thibaut Courtois before John Obi Mikel stoops to knock the ball into a bin with a diving header. After just about managing to complete the feat all seven players celebrate wildly, the sort of scenes that might be seen against Crystal Palace on Sunday if Chelsea win at the King Power Stadium and then on their return to Stamford Bridge. The champions-elect have been preparing for Wednesday night's game at the National Football Centre at Burton-on-Trent since Monday, where they are staying at the on-site Hilton Hotel. While French forward Remy was more than willing to jump around with his team-mates in the video at the hotel, he has been ruled out of the game against Leicester by  Mourinho. With Mikel on the floor, Courtois and Terry leap into the air in celebrations that could soon be repeated . The seven players involved in the game at St George's Park jump around in a celebratory huddle . Drogba and his team-mates can wrap up the Barclays Premier League title with two more league victories . Diego Costa is also a doubt having missed almost a month of action with a hamstring problem that has bugged him for much of the season. Midfielder Oscar has a chance of returning from the concussion he suffered against Arsenal in a challenge by goalkeeper David Ospina on Sunday. St George's Park, which opened in October 2012, is used by the full range of England teams as well as club sides. Barcelona, Galatasaray and Monaco are among the visiting teams to have stayed there.

"Selfie queen Karen Danczuk has revealed her ambition to be an MP – insisting she could relate to ordinary women unlike the current crop of female politicians. Mrs Danczuk said women were turned off politics because there was no-one in Parliament like them. The glamorous Labour councillor, who is married to the outspoken MP Simon Danczuk, said Parliament needed people like her ‘to bring it back down to reality’. Scroll down for video . Selfie queen Karen Danczuk told LBC's Nick Ferrari (pictured) in Liverpool today that she aspired to be an MP – insisting she could relate to ordinary women unlike the current crop of female politicians . Mrs Danczuk, 31, who revealed earlier this year that she had suffered sexual abuse, told LBC’s Nick Ferrari that she had rebuilt her life after being ‘shattered’ as a child. She said she used provocative selfie pictures on Twitter as a way of saying to others: ‘I will not be ashamed about who I am.’ Mrs Danczuk said she had rebuilt her life after the abuse, but now had the confidence to go into politics. She said: ‘There’s not many women that can relate to women. The women we do have in politics – and I’m not being rude to them because they’re really, really good – are they relating to ordinary women? I think they could relate a bit more.’ Mrs Danczuk became a hit on Twitter after posting a series of provocative photos of herself. She now describes herself as the 'selfie queen' Mrs Danczuk, 31, who revealed earlier this year that she had suffered sexual abuse, told LBC’s Nick Ferrari that she had rebuilt her life after being ‘shattered’ as a child .

I think in some ways women like me need to, to bring it back down to reality.’ The mother of two said she didn’t agree with the way women politicians always talked about female issue like childcare. She said: ‘I don’t necessarily think we should assume that because you’re a women, you should focus all your time and effort focussing on childcare. ‘Just speaking a language they understand – you know, dashing to do a school run, to then dash to the supermarket – just speaking about everyday problems.’ She said: ‘Women that I speak to, there’s just nothing there for them to relate to.’ Karen Danczuk, pictured outside Parliament last week, could find herself on the Commons benches with her husband . Mrs Danczuk, the Labour councillor and wife of MP Simon Danczuk, stopped for a drink at the Red Lion pub outside Parliament . Mrs Danczuk also spoke about the sex abuse abuse she suffered as a child and called for anyone who had gone through it to see a therapist. She said: ‘It shatters you – you trust no-one. You have nightmares. You can’t live a normal live.’ But she said therapy had helped. ‘I will not be ashamed about who I am. I used to be ashamed. If anyone says you shouldn’t wear low-cut tops – no, reclaiming your body is a part of the process of recovery. ‘Your body has been taken away from you – they take your body, you lose control of it. It’s not a good place to be.’ She said she used to have ‘horrific nightmares’ every night and couldn’t sleep. Mrs Danczuk said having therapy and ‘dealing with it’ had transformed her life. ‘I don’t think I’m God’s gift to man, but I just have that confidence back because I’ve took control of my life – because that’s what therapy does.’ She said selfies were important to her because they allowed her to be herself. ‘It’s just been happy with you.

Not a true winner: Her times that qualified her to run in Monday's Boston Marathon have now been erased, and her spot in the event has been vacated . Kendall Schler crept onto the marathon course after the last checkpoint and since she was spotted  at the starting point of the race just blocks from finish line, she may have lingered in that area before sneaking in . Schler claims to have removed both the magnetic strips meant to record her times from her race (violation of race protocol) and since no photographs of her were taken along the way there is no proof she is the rightful winner. Her finish time that qualified her to run in Monday's Boston Marathon has now been erased, and her spot in the event has been vacated. Her third-place finish last year also was wiped out after officials couldn't find evidence that she crossed any of that event's checkpoints. 'It’s a difficult situation for everybody, including the people who run a fair race and don’t get the recognition they should receive,' said Nancy Lieberman, president of GO! St. Louis. 'I said to her, ""It looks like you perpetrated a fraud.""' 'I have nothing legitimate that says she officially started and ran 26.2 miles in 2014 or 2015,' she added. Lieberman said incidents of dishonest runners happened but called this 'an extreme case.' When Lieberman made Schler prove she ran all of the checkpoints from last years race she was unable to provide them and he title was stripped from her. 'I said, ""I’m going to disqualify you in 2014 unless you provide me photos of you along the course,"" ' Lieberman said. 'I told her if she showed me photos within two hours I’d consider not disqualifying her.' Liar: Kendall Schler (left) was unable to prove that she won this year's marathon in St. Louis so Andrea Karl (right) was named this year's winner . Tough race: Runners return to St. Louis from E. St. Louis on the Martin Luther King Bridge during the race . The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that the course has seven spots where a runner is meant to record a time. The spots are the start, the finish, and five spots within the course. Lieberman said she did not register a time at any spot. There was no electronic evidence of any of those times either. According to the president of the marathon Nancy Leiberman, Schler claimed to have removed the magnetic strips from both of her race bibs. Tampering with race bibs is a violation of race protocol, says Leiberman. Lieberman checked with U.S. Track and Field officials on the course who also saw no sign of her. 'They’re situated in specific places so that people can’t cheat and jump on at other times,' Lieberman said. 'They didn’t see (Schler) anywhere on the course.' The true winner of the race was a woman named Angela Karl who Lieberman says didn't get the recognition that she deserved. 'There’s a euphoria the winner gets, breaking the tape and having the crowd cheer,' Lieberman said. 'The true winner did everything right and didn’t get her due.' Didn't get her cheer: 'There’s a euphoria the winner gets, breaking the tape and having the crowd cheer,' Lieberman said of the feeling of winning .","Kendall Schler crept onto the GO!

"We’ve all been there: you hear a catchy song and for days - or even weeks - on end you just can’t get it out of your head. Known as an earworm or brainworm, the effect has been studied before - but its cause, and how to get rid of it, is poorly understood. Now researchers say they have an answer; chewing gum after hearing a catchy song will help you think about it less often. Reading scientists say chewing gum helps you forget a song. In a study people were less likely to think about it when chewing (stock image shown). And they were a third less likely to 'hear' it when chewing gum. The results suggests same technique could stop other intrusive thoughts . The study was carried out by scientists at the University of Reading. In the research 98 volunteers were played the ‘catchy tunes’ Play Hard by David Guetta and Payphone by Maroon 5. - Recent music exposure . - Repeated music exposure . - Word triggers (eg. the word ‘faith’) - People triggers (where sight or memory of a person is associated with a song) - Situation trigger (eg. weddings can cause you to remember your own first dance song) - Stress . - Surprise . - Dreams . - Mind wandering . Over the next three minutes, they were then asked to hit a key every time they thought of the songs - while chewing gum, not chewing gum or tapping their finger. While chewing gum, volunteers reported thinking of the song less often than when they weren’t chewing gum, or when they were told to tap their finger instead. And chewing gum also reduced the amount they ‘heard’ the song in their minds by a third. The study is the first to examine the effects of chewing gum on earworms - and it suggests it could also be used to stop other unwanted or intrusive thoughts. ‘Interfering with our own “inner speech” through a more sophisticated version of the gum-chewing approach may work more widely,’ said Dr Phil Beaman, from the University’s School of Psychology and Clinical Language Sciences, who led the study. In the research 98 volunteers were played the ‘catchy tunes’ such as Play Hard by David Guetta and Payphone by Maroon 5 (pictured). Over the next three minutes, they were then asked to hit a key every time they thought of the songs - while chewing gum, not chewing gum or tapping their finger . While chewing gum, volunteers reported thinking of the song less often than when they weren’t chewing gum, or when they were told to tap their finger instead. And chewing gum also reduced the amount they ‘heard’ the song in their minds by a third (stock image shown) ‘However more research is needed to see whether this will help counter symptoms of obsessive-compulsive and similar disorders.’ In a previous study by the University of Reading in 2009, it was found that almost any song can become an earworm. A recent poll suggested over 90 per cent of the population experience them at least once a week with 15 per cent classifying their earworms as ‘disturbing’.","Reading scientists say chewing gum helps you forget a song .

"This is the chilling message a mother wrote on Facebook a day after allegedly abandoning her quadriplegic 21-year-old son in the Pennsylvania woods with just a blanket and a bible. 'I'm so happy,' Nyia Parler, 41, commented under a new picture of her cuddling her boyfriend on Tuesday. Just 24 hours earlier, police say she wheeled her care-dependent son into a park near their home in south west Philadelphia and left him there, before going to stay with her partner in Maryland. Relatives, who had been contacted by the boy's school when he didn't turn up to class on Tuesday, commented on Parler's picture, 'nyia call me asap,' and 'How the hell you happy?!? Call me!' On Sunday police said that Parler will be arrested as soon as she is released from hospital herself. Parler was admitted to a Maryland facility on Sunday for an 'undisclosed condition' and faces charges including aggravated assault, reckless endangering, neglect of a care-dependent person, kidnapping, unlawful restraint and false imprisonment, according to police in Pennsylvania. 'When her treatment is completed, we will take her to court and she can either waive or fight extradition,' Capt. Paul Starks of the Montgomery County, Maryland, police said in a statement. Chilling: This is the message Nyia Parler wrote on Facebook hours after she allegedly left her quadriplegic son alone in woodland with just a blanket and a bible. Relatives contacted by the boy's school frantically replied . Charged: Parler (right) was detained in Maryland on Saturday night, charged with assault and neglect. Police say she left her son on Monday to visit her boyfriend John Ferguson (left) in Montgomery County, Maryland . Horrific: The quadriplegic man was found here on the floor of a secluded woodland outside Philadelphia with this Bible and this blanket, 10 feet from his wheelchair. He'd allegedly been left there by his mother five days earlier . Parler left her son — who also has cerebral palsy — lying in leaves and covered with a blanket next to a wheelchair while she left town on a romantic getaway with her new boyfriend, John Ferguson, police said. He was found on Friday night near Cobbs Creek Park. Police believe he had been there for five days and the last time he and his mother were seen together was on Easter Sunday. She then boarded a bus to bisit Ferguson in Maryland, said Lt. John Walker of the Southwest Detectives Division. Walker said the victim was found around the corner from their home, and he described the scenario authorities believe to have taken place: 'She pushes him about 150 yards from the highway into the wooded area, takes him out of wheelchair, lays him on the ground, puts a blanket over him and leaves a Bible with him, and then just walks away.' During the period he was exposed to the elements, the young man was 'completely defenseless' in an area with wild animals, with no water and in cold, damp weather, Walker said. 'It's only by the grace of God that he survived this. Amazing,' he said. Reports claim relatives have been trying to obtain guardianship of the boy from Parler (pictured) for years . Contacted in Maryland after the young man's school became concerned about her absence, the victim's mother told relatives and authorities that he was with her, Walker said. 'Obviously her statements made during the week were not truthful,' he said. Her boyfriend, however, assumed other relatives were caring for the young man and 'was in shock when he learned what happened,' Walker said. A 16-year-old son also residing with the family is now in the care of other family relatives, Walker added. Walker said the son was hospitalized with dehydration, malnutrition, a deep cut on his back that caused concern about potential infection and possible eye injuries, but he appeared to be improving. 'He seemed to be a little happier yesterday,' Walker said. 'You could tell he knew his family was around and felt more comfortable. The 21-year-old, who is non-verbal and suffers from cerebral palsy, is now in Philadelphia Children's Hospital with his aunts, where he is being treated for dehydration and cuts to his back and eyes. Officials told NBC Philadelphia her son would have died if he hadn't been spotted by people walking along a nearby street. 'This kid is obviously a fighter. It's just unbelievable how we found him last night. It's just heartbreaking to see how another human, especially a mother, could treat him like that,' Lt. Walker of Philadelphia Police told ABC. Abandoned: A passerby noticed the 21-year-old here in a wooded Philadelphia park . The son was hospitalized with dehydration, malnutrition, a cut to his back and eye injuries. According to Philly.com two of his aunts, who are with him in hospital, have been trying to obtain guardianship for years. A neighbor, who declined to be identified, told DailyMail.com: 'She used to push him out to the school bus in his wheelchair, she seemed to care for him. Whenever I saw him, I saw her.' Another, who also wished to remain anonymous, said: 'I would see them outside together in the summer when he got home from school. Nothing looked wrong, I didn't suspect anything.' Walker said the son was exposed to the elements and other dangers. 'A lot of things could have happened out there,' he said. 'Obviously he's in the middle of a wooded area. You have wild animals there ... this kid could not defend himself. He does not function at all.' Walker added : 'What we've learned so far is that the 21-year-old child lives with his mother, completely dependent on mom as a result of his condition. 'She also has a 16-year-old son who is staying with other family members. 'We know she left for Maryland on Monday to go see her boyfriend on a bus.' The man had been reported missing from class at Philadelphia's School Of The Future on Monday. However, when a teacher called Parler she told them they were both in Maryland and he was well. Rescuers used flashlights to find the non-verbal in the East Lansdowne area of Philadelphia on Friday night .

"(CNN)So now the real trial is underway: What does the surviving Boston Marathon bomber, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, deserve and why?  What's he likely to get and why? Let's start where the penalty phase starts, with the prosecution's case. Prosecutors have listed, as they must, the aggravating circumstances that make this horrific mass murderer deserve the harshest punishment. The killing was ""heinous, cruel and depraved.""   He placed a bomb in a crowd, set it to kill and maim children and adults indiscriminately -- if that's not heinous, cruel and depraved, what is? Cruelty classically consists of a desire to cause pain and suffering in innocent victims, or, at the opposite extreme, it reflects a cold, callous indifference. Tsarnaev displayed both. Cruelty really provides us a lens into the worst of the worst of the worst. The number of dead from the bombing (three) and injured (260), including dozens maimed, also elevate these murders.  The victims were vulnerable -- no one more so than 8-year-old Martin Richard.  For 2,500 years, we have proclaimed that all human beings are equally valuable, yet we identify certain victims as especially worthy, and those who prey on them as especially culpable. The prosecution's emphasis: The killings involved ""substantial planning and premeditation"" and a betrayal of the United States -- the very country that gave Tsarnaev shelter and citizenship. And then there's the selection of the site, the Boston Marathon, an ""iconic"" event. And then there's Tsarnaev's lack of remorse -- opening day, the prosecutor's final shot of Tsarnaev locked up, giving the security camera the finger.  From his blood-scrawled justification in the boat after the bombing to this day, the message has been: Screw you, society. Tsarnaev may take the stand to beg for mercy, but only if he now feels or at least can fake remorse. And don't confuse regret with remorse.  No doubt Tsarnaev regrets his present predicament, regrets the negative publicity he's brought his friends and family and most poignantly regrets running over and killing his older brother while trying to escape.  But that's a far cry from genuine remorse for the victims he's killed and maimed. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was the lesser of two evils, the defense will insist over and over. Tamerlan was the source of his younger brother's malicious intent.  As the prisoners inside Washington D.C.'s now defunct Lorton Central Prison once described the street code to me:  No snitching, but if someone dies, then ""the dead guy did everything."" So the defense will claim that Dzhokhar was not fully responsible because he could not be.  After all, he was only 19.  Biologists teach us our brains don't fully develop until we're 25.  Thus, their argument goes, a 19-year-old simply can't be the worst of the worst. In 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the death penalty for those younger than 18 when they killed, repeatedly quoting an article by psychologists Laurence Steinberg and Elizabeth Scott.  But in the same article, these leading developmental psychologists themselves characterized it as an ""open question whether under real-world conditions the decision making of mid-adolescents is truly comparable with that of adults."" And they were talking about 17-year-olds. To the best of my knowledge, science has not and cannot establish a definitive connection between organic brain development and moral responsibility. Think about it:  When a 19-year-old bravely dashes into a burning building, risking his life to save children inside, we celebrate this heroism. We do not, nor should we, dismiss this bravery as the product of an impulsive not-yet-fully-formed personality.  If we can fully celebrate good character and heroic acts of our best young adults, why can't we fully condemn the cowardly viciousness of our worst? What outcome would I predict in the Tsarnaev case? Confronted by surviving victims and images of their dead loved ones, hearing offsetting pleas to ""move on,"" balancing the real suffering in the courtroom against the  imagined punishment of life that awaits Tsarnaev, I expect the jury will vote 10-2 (or 9-3) for death. But they must be unanimous for death; a lopsided but divided jury would result in a life sentence. Worse, the historical record and headlines in the next day's anti-death penalty news organizations will probably proclaim:  ""Jury Chooses Life for the Marathon Bomber"" -- even if overwhelmingly the people's representatives were to vote for death as the more appropriate punishment. Requiring a unanimous verdict for death gives the defense an enormous advantage -- one of many.  Why? Because in the end, we would much prefer that 1 or 10 or 20 convicted murderers who deserve to die instead live out their lives in the relatively nonpunitive condition of prison than one person who deserves to live be wrongly killed at the hands of the people. And yet, if we really commit ourselves to having the punishment fit the crime, if we rightly reserve the death penalty for the most heinous crimes and criminals, surely the Boston Marathon bomber stands among the worst of the worst.","Robert Blecker: In sentencing phase, the prosecution lays out wealth of evidence that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev deserves penalty reserved for the worst of the worst .
He predicts most of the jury will vote for a death sentence, but it must be unanimous; therefore, Tsarnaev will most likely get life in prison .",1b1b788f9a5f23b7a6d062863364035818accc4a

"All eyes were on John Terry this afternoon as he made the short trip across London to face QPR in the west London derby. Loftus Road was the place where the Chelsea skipper racially abused then QPR defender Anton Ferdinand in October 2011. Ferdinand's brother Rio was injured for Sunday's match. Terry, who has been a crucial part of Jose Mourinho's Premier League title bid this season, played the full 90 minutes however as Chelsea scraped a 1-0 win, but how did he get on... John Terry (centre) celebrates at the final whistle with Didier Drogba (left) and Branislav Ivanovic . Reception . There was a hostile introduction for Terry as the teams lined up, before a cacophony of boos rang out around the ground as he touched the ball in the opening minute. There was, however, no noticeable reaction from any of Chris Ramsey's players until Charlie Austin made himself known to the centre-back late in the first half with a robust challenge. Terry experienced a hostile atmosphere at Loftus Road, but put in a good display at the back for Chelsea . Temperament . It was a moment to cherish for the QPR fans as Austin responded to an arm across the chest by shoving Terry to the ground off the ball. The Chelsea skipper momentarily lost his cool and berated the assistant referee to the delight of the crowd. His battle with the striker continued into the second half, with the pair taken aside for a word after squaring up to each other but it was Terry who had the last laugh as Cesc Fabregas' late equaliser sealed three points. The Chelsea captain rises above Bobby Zamora to head the ball away as he dominated at the back . Performance . The former England captain was rarely troubled by Bobby Zamora and Charlie Austin. Although the pair were prominent throughout, a lack of pace meant Terry and partner Gary Cahill were able to deal with everything thrown at them even though they were bailed out by Thibaut Cortouis at times. There was a nervy moment in the first half when a long ball over the top caught out the 34-year-old, and he was lucky his misjudged touch didn't cost the side as Cahill covered, but it was a fairly comfortable day for the defender. The Chelsea captain was made to stretch occasionally, but he and Gary Cahil dealt with QPR's threat well . Conduct . Despite an obvious attempt from Austin to get under the skin of Terry, he largely ignored the attention surrounding him and focused solely on leading his side to an important win while handling the occasion with maturity. There were wild celebrations from Terry at the final whistle as he responded to the constant jeers. Terry's combative encounter with Charlie Austin attracted the attention of referee Andre Marriner .","John Terry racially abused Anton Ferdinand at the ground in October 2011 .

"In a retweet on Thursday, a staffer to real estate magnate Donald Trump managed to capture the coarsest background conversations Americans are having about former secretary of state Hillary Clinton's personal baggage. He may now be looking for a new job. 'If Hillary Clinton can't satisfy her husband,' a Texas-cowgirl college student tweeted, 'what makes her think she can satisfy America?' When someone retweeted the quip two hours later and included Trump's Twitter handle in the message, one of the billionaire's staffers retweeted it for him – to his audience of 2.8 million people. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . THE INTERNET IS FOREVER: A social media staffer to Donald Trump retweeted an off-color jab at Hillary Clinton on Thursday before the boss deleted it . Trump, a multibillionaire who's considering a presidential run, will be in New Hampshire on Saturday – where the episode will likely come up . SATISFIED? Bill Clinton (left) was a famous lothario during his presidency, even carrying on one affair with a White House intern . Time elapsed: Less than three hours. His office confirmed on Friday that it was a Trump employee, not a fat-fingered CEO, who was responsible. 'Mr. Trump was not responsible for this tweet,' a spokesperson told Daily Mail Online. 'It was retweeted by one of ten staff members that periodically help execute on Mr. Trump’s various social media platforms.' 'As soon as Mr. Trump saw the tweet he deleted it,' the spokesperson added. Hillary Clinton's once-strained relationship with her philandering husband isn't likely to be the stuff of TV ads in the 2016 presidential race, but the tweet suggests an undercurrent of crude jokes are being made at her expense. Sawyer Burmeister, a Texas equestrian champion, originated the line about Hillary Clinton's alleged inability to 'satisfy' her randy husband Bill . Bill Clinton, the 42nd U.S. president, had an affair with a White House intern named Monica Lewinsky. He also famously caroused with other women who were not his wife, going back to his days as the governor of Arkansas. A recent book about the staff who run the White House residence recounted a butler's story about hearing HIllary throw an object at him during the height of the Lewinsky saga. Taylor Burmeister, who wrote the tweet about Hillary failing to satisfy Bill, deleted it just before noon on Friday, along with a second message. 'Sry to those offended by me merely making a political joke,' she had tweeted in a follow-up. 'Get some rest, there are more important things in the world to be worried about.' She assured Daily Mail Online in an email that no one fro, the Trump camp had asked her to delete the tweets. 'I deleted them by choice because of the negative backlash I was receiving,' she said. 'I didn't even know Donald Trump had retweeted it until about an hour ago.' Burmeister confirmed to Daily Mail Online that she had deleted her tweets because of a nasty backlash . She originally offered an apology to people who were offended, but it apparently wasn't enough for some . Burmeister is no stranger to media attention. A world champion equestrian, she also had a bit part last year in an episode of the reboot of the 'Dallas' TV drama. And she's a pre-law student studying criminal justice at Tarleton State University in Texas, according to her social media profiles. Trump's retweet might have disappeared if a snarky Twitter user hadn't made a screen capture on his phone. 'Hey @RealDonaldTrump – In case you're looking for that tweet you deleted,' he wrote, 'I got it right here.' Hillary Clinton's campaign did not respond to requests for comment.","Sawyer Burmeister, a horse-riding champion and sometimes actress, tweeted the barb on Thursday evening .

"All well and good having Brazilians in your team but they have to be the right ones – Barcelona reached the Champions League semi-finals at the Nou Camp at Paris Saint Germain’s expense and Neymar tied David Luiz in knots in the process. There were no Luis Suarez nutmegs this time but the former Chelsea defender found himself backpedaling hopelessly on the quarter hour as Neymar scooted past him for Barcelona’s opener. Neymar (top) celebrates with Brazilian compatriot Dani Alves after scoring his and Barcelona's second goal of the night . Neymar accelerates past another Brazil teammate, David Luiz, before opening the scoring for Barcelona on Tuesday night . Barcelona: Ter Stegen 6.5; Dani Alves 7.5, Pique 5, Mascherano 6, Jordi Alba 6; Rakitic 7.5, Busquets 7 (Sergi Roberto 55, 6), Iniesta 9 (Xavi 45, 6.5); Messi 6.5, Suarez 6.5 (Pedro 75, 6), Neymar 9. Subs not used: Bravo, Bartra, Adriano, Rafinha. Goals: Neymar 14, 34. PSG: Sirigu 6; Van der Wiel 3.5, Marquinhos 4.5, Luiz 5, Maxwell 6; Verratti 6, Cabaye 4 (Lucas Moura 66, 6.5), Matuidi 6 (Rabiot 80, 6); Cavani 4 (Lavezzi 80, 6.5), Ibrahimovic 4.5, Pastore 3. Subs not used: Douchez, Camara, Digne,  Bahebeck. Booked: Luiz. Referee: Svein Oddvar Moen (Norway) He was then a spectator on the half hour when his international team-mate got the second climbing unmarked to head Dani Alves’ cross past Salvatore Sirigu to make it 5-1 on aggregate. PSG’s soft centre cost them in the first leg and it was cruelly exposed again. Luiz was also booked inside the first five minutes for a foul on Andres Iniesta, who ran the first half. The man who won the World Cup for Spain but is these days criticised for neither scoring nor assisting went on a sublime run for the first goal, pulling away from Edinson Cavani and swerving past Marco Verratti before releasing Neymar. The French champions thought they were back in the game between the two Barcelona goals when on 17 minutes Zlatan Ibrahimovic had the ball in the net but he was a yard offside when Blaise Matuidi slipped him through and the flag was raised to rule out the goal. The Swede was jeered by Barcelona supporters in the early stages as was former Barcelona defender Maxwell but such was Barca’s dominance that home fans eased up on the light-hearted abuse. Suarez and Messi were also impressive in the first half and Alves looked like a man trying to impress a potential employer. PSG could still be a possible destination for him beyond the end of this season. He tested Sirigu from distance before his assist for Neymar’s second. With Suarez and Alves snapping into challenges and Iniesta and Neymar providing the finesse Barcelona were completely dominant – to the extent that for once Messi was not their most impressive performer. The home side eased up after the break and PSG breathed more easily without ever threatening to get back into the tie. Rakitic saw his shot saved and Messi went close with chip that Sirigu gathered.

Great Britain's tennis No 1 Andy Murray (left) was at the Nou Camp alongside his friend and former tennis player Ross Hutchins . PSG did force a save from Marc-Andre Ter Stegen 10 minutes into the second half when Ibrahimovic tried his luck from distance but the German keeper who has watched Claudio Bravo not put a foot wrong in the league all season gave another faultless display. Missing the domestic campaign has been tough but a final appearance in Berlin would be some consolation. Luis Enrique’s side were so comfortable at half-time Xavi replaced the impeccable Iniesta at the break. And it wasn’t long before Busquets and Suarez were also given early cuts. Barcelona still have a league to win and play the Catalan derby against Espanyol this weekend with sill just a narrow two point lead over Real Madrid. Iniesta had done enough in 45 minutes of football to not need to come out after half time. His performance and at times Barca’s was a throwback to some of their best football under Pep Guardiola when the won this completion in both 2009 and 2011. Iniesta was in sensational form for Barcelona before replaced at half time by veteran midfielder Xavi . Barcelona's captain had been criticised earlier this season for a lack of goals and assists but he looks to be back to his best . Guardiola was the name on most supporters lips at half time as news filtered through that Bayern were mauling Porto and were also heading for the semi-finals. The prospect of Barcelona and Bayern being drawn together on Thursday is mouth-watering. Although perhaps on current form, and in view of his side’s injuries, Guardiola might prefer to leave the reunions for Berlin on June 6.

"As America's elite crime investigators they are more used to tackling crime. But now FBI agents have been told they have to new enemy to battle -- calories. Expanding waistlines and lack of mobility for many agents has led to the introduction of a compulsory fitness tests. Those who fail will have the marks noted on their annual performance review and could lead to being moved from assignments that involve physical activity. Compulsory fitness tests have been introduced for all FBI agents following fears over expanding waistlines . FBI chief James Coney has introduced the tests amid fears his 135,000 agents are slipping behind when it comes to personal fitness. He said the force depends on its agents ability to 'run, fight and shoot'. Coney also said he wants the people to take one look at an agent think 'there goes a special agent of the FBI' rather than a derogatory remark about being overweight. Police in America are often parodied for their love of doughnuts and few forces have any weight restrictions. New recruits to the FBI have to take a physical test but for the last 16 years have not had to undergo any other fitness exam. As part of the annual test agents aged under 30 will have to run a mile in twelve and half minutes and sprint 300 metres in 59 seconds. They will also have to perform 24 push ups without stopping and 35 sit ups in a minute. Some agents have complained about the five minute break between the exercises as they struggle to catch their breath. FBI chief James Coney said the force depends on its agents' ability to 'run, fight and shoot' Older agents are given slightly longer times to perform the tests. A man in his 50s is allowed 15.14m for the mile run and 83 seconds for the sprint. The Federal Bureau of Investigation's 12,000 female agents must also take the test. According to the New York Times, who obtained an internal memo from Coney about the fitness tests, few agents have rushed to meet the October deadline to complete the physical. In the Washington DC office only 75 out of the 800 agents have taken the test. The introduction of the tests comes as America is grappling with an obesity problem with a third of adults deemed obese or overweight. Figures from the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention show that almost 80million adults are obese and the cause of death of more than 120,000 people a year. First Lady Michelle Obama has been at the forefront of tackling child obesity with a nationwide 'Let's Move' campaign urging children to get more exercise. The cost to the health care system treating people with illness caused by overeating such as strokes and heart attacks has been put at $98billion a year. The concern about the fitness of FBI agents began after the 9/11 terror attacks when the agency switched its main mission from catching criminals to fighting terrorism. Rather than taking part in arrests, often involving chasing criminals, they would spend hours sat behind a desk. Much of their work now involves cyber crime and intelligence gathering which mostly involves desk work and little exercise. 'You could see that health and fitness were not the priority it used to be,' said Zachary Lowe, the chief of physical instruction at the FBI HQ in Quantico, Virginia. Much of the FBI's work now involves cyber crime and intelligence gathering which mostly involves desk work and little exercise - hence the new drive to get fit . FBI chief Comey, who took over in 2013, discovered on touring field offices that morale was low. He also notes that many agents didn't look as if they would be able to pass the physical exam they had taken on joining the force. His new regime has led to many calling the agency the 'Fit Bureau of Investigation.' J Edgar Hoover, the famed first director of the FBI, had made fitness tests compulsory while he was in charge. Its current director said the lives of people they protect depend on agents fitness and health and they were symbols of what is 'right and good' about the US. He said: 'The lives of your colleagues and those you protect may well depend upon your ability to run, fight and shoot, no matter what job you hold. 'I want you to look like the squared away object of that reverence. I want the American people to be able to take one glance at you and think ""THERE is a special agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"".'","Compulsory fitness tests introduced thanks to expanding waistlines .

"Argentina internationals from Manchester City and Manchester United looked delighted as they joined forces on Sunday night, enjoying a meal with their partners in the city centre. Stars such as Angel di Maria, Pablo Zabaleta and Marcos Rojo embraced as they dined at the popular San Carlo Italian Restaurant. The United players had just returned from a disappointing 1-0 defeat by Premier League leaders Chelsea on Saturday, while the City men were still on a high following a comfortable victory over West Ham. A host of Argentine stars including Angel di Maria (left) and Willy Caballero (right) dined out together at San Carlo restaurant on Sunday along with Manchester United goalkeeper Victor Valdes .

"You won’t find it written down anywhere in black and white yet it remains one of the unseen by-laws of the game: until such time as an almighty mess is sitting squarely on FIFA’s front step, the governing body chooses to keep the door bolted firmly shut. Rows over goal-line technology were hardly something new when Frank Lampard’s infamous ‘ghost’ goal against Germany in the 2010 World Cup finally brought matters to a head. The 2000 Africa Cup of Nations Final between Nigeria and Cameroon had already been scarred by a similar howler while the world watched agog five years later as a Pedro Mendez effort which crossed the line at Old Trafford was incredibly missed by all the officials despite keeper Roy Carroll ending up tangled in the rigging. Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths has a goal-bound shot blocked by the outstretched arm of Josh Meekings . Such was the hullabaloo over the incident involving the Portuguese star that FIFA did, in fact, begrudgingly make some noises about trialling goal-line systems but it was no more than platitudes to appease the masses. It took Lampard’s ruled-out effort in Bloemfontein – with the ball being clearly a yard over Manuel Neuer’s line in the last-16 match – for the dam to finally burst. Despite initially shrugging off calls for the adoption of goal-line technology to be approved, FIFA relented two years later with the system fully operational last year in Brazil. The lesson for Scottish football fans still bemused by events at Hampden Park on Sunday when the officials failed to spot a potentially game-changing handball? Perhaps only when such an outrage occurs in the World Cup in Russia in three years’ time will common sense prevail. For those who believe the SFA are intransigent to football embracing the kind of video technology that would have seen Josh Meekings red carded and Celtic awarded a penalty in the Scottish Cup semi-final, here’s some news… . In February, the International Football Board – the SFA, FA, Irish FA, Welsh FA and FIFA – gathered in Belfast supposedly to discuss the possibility of approving trials. Before the meeting, FA representative David Gill made no bones about his association’s stance. Griffiths heads the ball, which is deflected clearly off the hand of Inverness' Josh Meekings (left) on Sunday . ‘We can’t live in the past,’ he stated. ‘Greg Dyke the (FA chairman) has come out and said he embraces it, and I think in certain circumstances I would look at it. We’ve got to move forward. The game is getting much quicker. ‘The TV coverage, you know, 28, 30 cameras a game. Everything is replayed, replayed. So how do we use that? My personal view is yes, sensibly, but it needs to be done in a manner that doesn’t detract from the fast-paced, quick action of football.’ Despite cases also being forwarded by the SFA and Irish FA to at least take the matter further, FIFA, aided by a sceptical Welsh representative, simply kicked the matter into the long grass. It won’t be discussed again for at least another year now with the inevitable injustices far enough off the radar in the interim. ‘It’s a question of making the biggest decision ever in the way football is played,’ said FIFA’s secretary general Jerome Valcke by way of an explanation for its rejection afterwards. While that may well be the case, procrastinating on the issue is hardly likely to resolve it. Injustices like those that almost certainly cost Celtic a place in the Scottish Cup Final on Sunday are hardly a rarity in the global game. Celtic captain Scott Brown (left) has words with referee Steven McLean during the Scottish Cup semi-final . Yet, until such time as one directly affects the outcome of a World Cup match involving one of the game’s heavyweights, they seem set to remain an ugly, unsatisfying feature of the landscape. To the great embarrassment of Michel Platini, the stationing of additional officials behind both goals has proved to be an extraordinary waste of time. Seemingly less reluctant to get involved than traditional linesman, ‘additional assistant referees’ - to give them their Sunday names - have seemed utterly superfluous since they were first trialled in the 2009-10 Europa League. On Sunday, Alan Muir, the official behind the goal, should have had a clear view of Meekings’ handball. But for reasons best known to himself, he failed to advise referee Steven McLean on what seemed an inevitable course of action. It took the high-profile blunder that denied Frank Lampard in 2010 to shift FIFA on goal-line tecnhology . ‘I knew it was a penalty,’ said Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths. ‘I think everyone in the ground knew it was a penalty. I asked the ref why he didn’t give the penalty and he said the assistant behind the goal said it hit him (Meekings) on the face.’ There is absolutely no excusing such crass incompetence. McLean and Muir should both have seen the handball with their own eyes and, even if one may have blinked at the wrong moment, assuredly one of them should have ensured the right call was made. That they didn’t is another blight on what’s been a desperate season for officiating in this country. Perhaps more than ever, the SFA now has good reason to press FIFA to at least road-test video technology. It’s hardly unchartered territory in sport. For those who prefer the oval ball game, a Television Match Official has been part of the fabric of rugby for 14 years now. No-one claims the system is perfect – decisions can often take longer to reach than they should - but few would dispute that it hasn’t enhanced the game because the right outcome is eventually arrived at. Lampard's disallowed goal forced FIFA to rethink, and Scottish fans must hope for a similar incident . Used only in first-class and international televised games, the TMO can only rule on exactly what the referee asks him. This usually involves, in try-scoring situations, whether a player’s foot has been in touch or to see if the ball has been properly grounded, but the TMO is also used to review if there has been dangerous or foul play. While the video review is normally conclusive, the snag – which is clearly a red flag for FIFA – is the time delay. At a recent Aviva Premiership match between Northampton Saints and Saracens, it took four minutes of review to award the winning try to the former while two other tries were disallowed. Edward Griffiths, the Saracens chief executive, later labelled the TMO process ‘a shambles’. ‘It’s almost make it up as you go along,’ Griffiths said. Indeed, rugby’s growing concern over the effect the TMO is having on the sport has led to Hawk-Eye, the ball-tracking technology company, to hold talks with the International Rugby Board about providing a replacement to the current system. Rugby's TMO may not be perfect, but it has shown that the game is better for use of technology . Hawk-Eye, which is already used in cricket, tennis and for goal-line decisions in football, says it can provide information for decisions within a few seconds by synchronising cameras from multiple angles. Paul Hawkins, the founder of Hawk-Eye, said: ‘Our system is a much cleverer way of looking at incidents. In Aussie Rules, we have halved the average time for decisions to be made.’ It can be assumed that, were FIFA to give tacit approval to video technology, Hawk-Eye would have just the programme to fit the bill. Using it sparingly would maintain the rhythm of football whilst ensuring that the 17 Laws of the Game are correctly applied. For football, the answers are already out there. If only someone would first ask the questions.","Celtic were denied place in Scottish Cup final by shocking decision .

"A transgender woman who had her face horribly damaged after it was injected with cement and tire sealant stepped out on Sunday showing off a new look. Rajee Narinesingh was one of the victims of 'toxic tush' doctor Oneal Ron Morris, who performed illegal plastic surgeries using substances such as Fix-a-Flat, Super Glue and mineral oil. Rajee had Morris inject her cheeks, lips and chin back in 2005, and ended up disfigured after she did not have the money to go to a proper cosmetic surgeon. Scroll down for videos . Rajee Narinesingh (above), one of the victims of 'toxic tush' doctor Oneal Ron Morris, stepped out showing her new face over the weekend . Rajee was recently treated by Dr Terry Dubrow and Dr Paul Nassif in a process that will be featured on the premiere episode of Botched . Left with a 'hard-as-rock' face, Rajee began seeing Dr John Martin of Coral Gables Cosmetic Reconstructive Surgery in 2012, who gave her softening injections and laser therapy to treat the botched surgery. In a 2014 interview she said that her new look was helping to boost her self-esteem, and that men were taking notice. 'Recently this guy said that being with me is like being with a sexy dragon,' she said at the time. 'I didn't know whether to slap him or kiss him.' Now, she has had her look improved once again by Dr Terry Dubrow and Dr Paul Nassif, a process that will be featured on the premiere episode of Botched. Rajee, who was born in New York but grew up in Philadelphia, explained when she realized she was a woman in that 2014 interview. She explained; 'Up until I was in my mid-twenties I just thought I was a feminine gay male. I thought about all the things I did when I was growing up - like taking the basketball my dad had bought me and instead of playing basketball with it I was simulating pregnancy and actually pretending to give birth and be a mommy. 'When I used to fantasize about being with guys I used to always picture myself with breasts and a vagina. I didn't realize I was doing it, it was just so natural for me. One day I just connected all the dots and thought ""you're not gay, you're transgender.""' Rajee lived in solitude and was afraid to go out after her face was left disfigured (above) That all changed in 2012 when she began receiving free treatments from Dr John Martin . Rajee, who had been too 'embarrassed and ashamed' to go to the authorities, claims she paid just $100 per session to Morris for the life-changing injections back in 2005. 'The last thing I wanted was to look like a man in a dress. I wanted to be a beautiful woman,' she said of her decision to get the injections. 'If you really want to live your authentic self as a woman you need to do some sort of face and body reconstruction. 'So I made the choice to get injections done. In our community it is called pumping.' And while she knew she was not seeing a licensed surgeon, she was still excited the day she went to see Morris. 'When it finally came to the day, I was more excited than nervous because I was finally going to be the woman I had always wanted to be,' she said. 'There was a room that she had set up where she did a lot of medical procedures.' The room looked sterile and clean she said, and sokn after she arrived they began the procedure. 'I got injections in my face and my hips and my buttocks and initially I was fine,' said Rajee. 'But then the nightmare started.' 'The last thing I wanted was to look like a man in a dress. I wanted to be a beautiful woman,' Rajee (above) said of her decision to get the injections. Oneal Ron Morris (above, file photo) is accused of leaving women ill and disfigured after injecting them with a mixture of toxic substances, including super glue and Fix-A-Flat . She was left with a large boil on her face that kept growing bigger and bigger, and then 'green pus exploded out of my face and onto the mirror. It was green and yellow and mixed with blood.' She ended up spending years in solitude as a result of these botched procedures, until Dr Martin agreed to help her for free. Because of him, she says she has gone from 'victim to victorious.' She is also ready to start dating again, saying; 'I definitely deserve more than just the 3 o'clock in the morning knock on the window.' As for Morris, she is now facing manslaughter charges after one of her patients died following a procedure.","Rajee Narinesingh, one of the victims of 'toxic tush doctor 'Oneal Ron Morris, stepped out showing her new face over the weekend .

"'Secret stuff': Ivana Chubbuck, 62, is a part therapist and part acting coach, known as the 'celebrity whisperer' She is known as the 'celebrity whisperer', a woman whose astonishing skill in honing Hollywood talent made an icon out of a man who used to stand on street corners dressed as a chicken. Today, Brad Pitt is known the world over. Ivana Chubbuck's client list includes Eva Mendes, Charlize Theron, Gerard Butler, Halle Berry, Sharon Stone and many others. So powerful are her methods, she reduced Beyoncé Knowles to tears within five minutes. And within months, the singer was topping the charts with Single Ladies. Part therapist, part acting coach, and very Hollywood, Chubbuck, 62, runs a hugely successful drama school in Los Angeles. She hosts workshops around the globe, as well as in the wood-panelled library of her £3 million home. Beyoncé went to Chubbuck when she was about to play legendary soul singer Etta James in the movie Cadillac Records and was looking to be taken seriously as an artist. Despite her professional success, Beyoncé was also at what she termed 'a pivotal point' in her life. 'I'm about empowering people,' Chubbuck told The Mail on Sunday in a rare interview – one which goes much further into her methods, and her clients' responses, than she usually allows. 'Beyoncé is a black girl from the South, that is her world. Like everyone else on the planet, she has issues. But once she faced those issues and realised she could use them in a positive way in her art, she flourished.' Apparently it's all about the 'secret stuff' that Chubbuck's clients tell her. Certainly it is well known that Beyoncé's relationship with her domineering father has been fractured for years. 'I told her to open up, to really get in touch with her feelings and what was going on inside her,' Chubbuck said. 'She started to feel her secret stuff and we start having a dialogue about it and she became emotional. We were crying together. She tapped into that well of pain inside her. 'She rang me up after we'd worked together on the movie and said, 'Listen to my new record – it's all the stuff you taught me.' And that's when she came out with Single Ladies and all the great female empowerment songs. The little pop star turned into a global icon.' When we meet at Chubbuck's home, model and actress Eva Mendes is just leaving after a three-hour 'intensive session' for her new movie with Ricky Gervais called Special Correspondents. Clients: Chubbuck works with some of the biggest names in show business including Beyonce (left) and Eva Mendes (right) Eva's Prada dress in pale orange . Shop the designer at Saks Fifth Avenue! Visit site . Esmeralda! We LOVE it. And we've a feeling little Esmeralda might be a little style icon in the making, just like her mum. So what that in mind, it's time to revisit one of our favourite Eva Mendes looks. This woman can wear what she likes. Even in bold shades of orange she still manages to look flawless, which is why we've decided to take some autumnal inspiration from this premiere perfect look. She wore this orange Prada dress back in March of 2013, but we still can't quite get over it. It's floaty, feminine and gorgeous. Eva teamed this orange number with a lighter hue satin shoe, which added another texture and dimension to the look. We would definitely suggest a strappy, metallic heel with this. So, if you're keen to update her look for the new season, check out our pick of the best colour-popping dresses (below).

Mendes said: 'Ivana's technique could be boiled down to: take the pain in your life and find the most effective way to accomplish a goal with it.' In other words, your guess is as good as mine. Mendes continues: 'It helps you understand humanity – what drives someone to do what they do, good or bad. It's not painful… it's cathartic.' Chubbuck first met Brad Pitt when he was working as a promoter for a fast-food restaurant dressed in a chicken suit, and tells a story of a young man so driven by a desire to succeed that he had no life aside from acting. Today, he is still a client and Chubbuck worked on his most recent movie, Fury. She made an icon out of Brad Pitt, who when she met him was working as a promoter at a fast-food restaurant dressed in a chicken suit . 'Brad always had a work ethic that put others to shame,' Chubbuck said. 'He studied and worked. I would pair him up with a partner and many of those partners would ask to be changed because Brad wanted to rehearse a scene three, four, five hours a day. He was dedicated to his craft. He had no social life. He had his stupid job and the rest of the time he was studying with me. 'For the major talents, fame is never the driving force. Brad worked his butt off, he's taken risks over the years and when he fails he gets back up and works harder. He makes bold choices and isn't afraid to fail.' So what is the secret? Chubbuck says her technique is based on delving into your 'deepest, darkest past' and then using those negative feelings to positively portray a character on screen. Some of this is outlined in a best-selling book The Power Of The Actor (Gotham Books) which has been translated into 18 languages. Stars such as Kate Bosworth, Camilla Belle, Elisabeth Shue and Mendes have given the tome glowing reviews. Mendes said: 'It is my bible – I don't leave home without it.' Chubbuck recently returned from a working trip to London and says the phenomenon of British actors dominating Hollywood (Eddie Redmayne, Benedict Cumberbatch, Daniel Craig) is 'because Brits have a great work ethic and are not afraid to take risks or make fun of themselves'. Do her celebrity friends such as Matthew Perry, James Franco and Jake Gyllenhaal ever expect star treatment? 'Bottom line is they are with me to work,' Chubbuck says. 'Celebrity goes out the window.

"Not a single Labour candidate questioned by a major polling company mentioned the deficit as being one of the biggest issues facing Britain. Ipsos Mori interviewed almost 100 candidates from the major parties, asking them what they thought the most important issues facing the country were. Not one Labour candidate listed the government spending or the deficit; compared to 35 per cent of Tory candidates. In an IpsosMori survey of people standing for election, not one of Ed Miliband's Labour candidates named the deficit as an important issue facing the country . 35 per cent of Tories mentioned the deficit, 5% of Lib Dems and 9 per cent of those surveyed standing for the Scottish National Party . Among the Liberal Democrats, 5 per cent mentioned the deficit as an issue; and even among the left-wing SNP, it was brought up by 9 per cent of candidates. The omission recalls Ed Miliband’s embarrassing gaffe in which he completely forgot an entire passage about the deficit from his conference speech last year. The issue of Britain’s relationship with the EU was also not mentioned by a single Labour candidate. Unlike David Cameron, Mr Miliband is not pledging any renegotiation of powers or a referendum on EU membership. Pollsters from Ipsos Mori asked 98 candidates to list what they thought were the biggest issues. They could mention anything they liked – there were no promptings. The top issue for all parties was the economy, mentioned by 85 per cent of Conservative and Lib Dem candidates but only 62 per cent of Labour ones. For Labour, the economy tied with health and the NHS as the main issue. It was mentioned by 62 per cent of candidates, compared with 65 per cent for the Lib Dems and 54 per cent of Tories. The next most important issues for Labour were ‘inequality’ (mentioned by 24 per cent of candidates), housing (21 per cent), and then jobs, immigration and education (all tied on 14 per cent). For Tory candidates, the third most important issue was spending and the deficit (35 per cent), jobs (31 per cent), education (27 per cent) and the relationship with the EU (19 per cent). No Conservative candidates mentioned inequality, housing or the impact of austerity. The economy and the NHS were the most frequently mentioned issues among the three main parties . Immigration, housing and international ties were the least likely to be mentioned by candidates . Austerity was the most important issue for the SNP (64 per cent), while surprisingly only 3 per cent of Labour candidates mentioned it. The survey, unveiled at a briefing by Ipsos Mori, was based on interviews with 98 candidates, including 26 Tories, 29 Labour and 20 Lib Dems. The briefing pointed out that the last time an opposition party was elected with an overall majority after just a single parliament out of office – the goal of Labour – was in 1931. It said that a leader had never been elected prime minister with such low ratings as Mr Miliband. But it also pointed out that the last time a governing party increased its votes hare after more than two years in office – the goal of Mr Cameron if the Tories are to govern alone – was 1955. Meanwhile Harriet Harman has admitted that drivers could be hit with a hike in fuel duty if Labour gets into power. The deputy Labour leader refused to rule out above inflation increases in taxes on fuel, alcohol, tobacco or air fares. Asked if the party would raise the levy on petrol, she told LBC: ‘We rule out increasing VAT, the basic or the higher rate of tax, we will put up the top rate of tax, we will not put up the national insurance rates. ‘For all the other taxes that there are – you know, airport taxes, I can’t remember what they are called, airport passenger duties, or alcohol duties or tobacco or petrol – we will lay that out in the Budget.’ It emerged that Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, had called for the scrapping of the Trident nuclear deterrent. The potential leadership contender suggested that Trident should be ‘the first to go in the round of public spending cuts to come after the general election’, according to a 2010 interview with Brixton Blog.","Poll of candidates asked them what were country's biggest challenges .

"A woman who is five months pregnant and was fired from her job at Popeyes after an armed robber made off with $400 on her shift says she has been offered her job. Only Marissa Holcomb isn't so sure she wants to go back to the fried chicken chain in Channelview, Texas. The mother-of-three was held at gunpoint on March 31, however she was fired when she refused to pay back the money that was stolen, with the store saying she should not have allowed so much cash to be in the till at one time. Now Popeyes have offered to take Holcomb back and have offered her $2,000 in backpay, since she has been out of work for almost one month. 'I do need a way to support my kids,' she told KHOU. '(But) I don't want to go back to a business where I'm treated the same and I just get pushed back out if something else happened.' Scroll down for video . Welcome back: Marissa Holcomb - who is five months pregnant with her fourth child - was fired from Popeyes after $400 was robbed from her till and she refused to pay it back. She has now been offered her job back, but is unsure whether to take it . Robbery: A man armed with a handgun and his concealed with a red beanie held up the Popeyes in Channelview, Texas, on March 31. Less than two days later Marissa Holcomb was fired . Hold up: The robber managed to get $400 cash from the till, which Popeyes said is too much money to have kept in the register. They said it is not the first time Holcomb had got in trouble for not clearing the till . Holcomb was left shaken by the incident, in which a man armed with a handgun and his face concealed with a red beanie jumped the counter and held the gun to her head, demanding money. Holcomb wasn't able to access the safes, so the robber made with the cash in the till - totaling $400. Her bosses said it was against there policy to have such an amount in the register and gave Holcomb an ultimatum - pay it back or lose her job. 'I just had a gun to me. I'm not paying the money,' Holcomb told KHOU earlier in the week. 'I don't think it's right because now I'm struggling for my family because what I had to do to keep my life. 'I mean who's gonna call me? I'm five months pregnant. 'The fact that I got robbed at gunpoint and it's like nobody cares.' Holcomb said she was fired less than two days after the incident. A Popeyes spokesman said it wasn't the first time Holcomb hadn't cleared the till. Marissa Holcomb, who is five months pregnant with her fourth child, was held at up at the fried chicken chain store in Channelview on March 31 and then fired because of it . The spokesman said that if Holcomb was given the opportunity to pay the money back they were not aware of such a situation. CEO Cheryl Bachelder then released a statement Wednesday evening, saying head office had 'reached out' to the owner of the Channelview store and asked him to 'apologize and rectify' the situation. Holcomb claimed she had done her job properly and that it was an extremely busy night. The chain were offering a popular two piece chicken special for $1.19 on the night of the robbery. 'They got what they got because that's what we made within one hour,' she said.

"For more than 2,000 years, invaders have been fighting over glorious Kefalonia. Romans, the Kingdom of Naples, the Venetian Republic, the Ottoman Empire, the French, British and, during the Second World War, the Italians and Germans have all left their mark. Fortunately, the present settlers - the Greeks themselves and the odd expat - have stoutly resisted the encroachment of mass tourism. So instead of fast-food restaurants you will find charming family-run tavernas that make this island a foodie heaven. Great forests of pines, cypress and cedars still sweep down the steep hillsides, often ending in cliffs of chalk as white as those at Dover, or in fine shingle and sand beaches, fringing a sea whose warm, sun-reflecting waters are of startling clarity. The famous curve of Myrtos beach, as well as many little inland villages, are seen on the road to Fiscardo . Inland, the roads, winding around mountains whose accessible slopes are swathed in olive groves and vineyards are blessedly free of excessive traffic. We landed at the island's only airport near the capital town of Argostoli, took a five-minute walk to the car-rental office and were quickly on our way to the village of Spartia on the southern coast - our first base of a two-centre holiday. Richard Johnson rejoices in unspoiled Kefalonia . We were staying first at the superb Villa Hephaestus. The view from our shady veranda was wonderful - indeed, my American wife called it 'awesome'. The sweep of Lourdas Bay, with its long sandy beaches, was spread out below us, while the neighbouring island of Zakynthos could be seen in the misty distance. Hephaestus is a modern villa with a well-equipped kitchen, and we love to cook. However, after a long day travelling, we decided we needed restorative cocktails, a carafe of white wine and a good fish dinner. Not fancying driving along twisting lanes, we called a taxi to take us to the beautifully situated and highly regarded Water Way restaurant at Spartia beach. The proprietor is a local fisherman, so the best of his catch goes to the kitchen, which is presided over by his wife, while his charming daughter Tepsi is in charge of front of house. From Lourdas Bay you can see Zakynthos Island, where the beautiful Shipwreck Beach (pictured) is found . A sweeping view across the turquoise waters of Lourdata Bay and the white stands of Lourdas Beach . The island is replete with diverse things to see on day trips but the nightlife is virtually non-existent, so we decided to stay home in the evenings and explore during the day. We checked out the string of beaches around Lourdas Bay and found plenty of good restaurants. At the top of a flight of easy steps from Lourdas beach, we found Lorraine's Magic Hill restaurant, with superb food lovingly prepared by the eponymous owner with ingredients from her husband's organic farm. The portions are generous and there's a great view across the bay to fellow Ionian isle Zakynthos. The popular Skala beach is just at the end of the bay. The Metaxa Beach Bar is a good place for coffee and the area is lined with tavernas. We shopped for supplies for our evening meals at Argostoli's port. One can buy catch-of-the-night fish straight from the boats that line the quay (park where you like, for free). The popular golden Skala beach is just at the end of the bay with the nearby Metaxa Beach Bar good for coffee . The town of Argostoli's port is ideal for picking up supplies, including catch-of-the-night fish  from the boats . Enjoyable excursions to the countryside took us to the ruined hilltop castle of St George, near Peratata, and the monastery of St Ayos. At both places entrance is free, and don't miss the Castle cafe just outside the gates. Its enthusiastic proprietors are Greek/English and serve superior food in a shady garden. The Monastery of Saint Geronimo is situated in a vine-clad valley north-east of the castle. It was rebuilt in Byzantine-style in the 1960s, the original having been destroyed during a 1953 earthquake. The walls of the interior are decorated in exuberant style with biblical scenes, and a huge candelabra hangs from the ceiling. We loved our stay in the south, but for the second week of our stay it was time to take the 35-mile drive to Fiscardo, on the island's north cape. The trip afforded superb views of the coast - including the famous curve of Myrtos beach - as well as many little inland villages. Fiscardo, once a remote fishing port, has been transformed into a world-class yachting centre, with smart restaurants and boutiques jostling for every inch of the quayside. The second week of our stay was a 35-mile drive away in the fishing village of Fiscardo , in the island's north . 'It's like St Tropez in the old days,' I mused. Our villa, Island View, is set on the hillside overlooking the port. From its verandas and infinity pool the neighbouring islands of Ithaca - mythical home of Odysseus - and Lefkas could be seen through the shimmering sea mist. We found some attractive beaches a few minutes' drive from Fiscardo. Our two favourites were Agia Jerusalem and Alaties, both reached by turning right out of the village of Maganos and following the signs. Agia Jerusalem is considered a 'secret' place, peaceful even in August. When we visited (in September), fewer than a dozen people were enjoying the sunbeds provided. Agia Jerusalem Beach is considered a 'secret' place, peaceful even in August, and a favourite of the writer . There's an excellent taverna, with fresh fish and dishes from a menu that changes daily. Alaties, on the other hand, is a tiny cove with a miniature beach. It's lovely to swim there. Among the fir trees above the beach is a modern restaurant where fresh prawns can be had. Apart from one afternoon of rain (we were on a boat trip to Lefkas but 30 minutes out of Fiscardo, an unexpected squall hit us and it rained for the remainder of the trip), the weather was perfect. We had a wonderful time with beautiful scenery, great food and fun when we wanted it. I can see why so many people have wanted to invade Kefalonia!","Visited Spartia in the south of Kefalonia and then Fiscardo, in the north .

"Down Augusta way they say the azaleas are in full bloom, which is more than can be said for England’s Justin Rose. A bruising Florida swing last month saw the Englishman fall outside the world’s top 10. For a player who has been virtually a fixture in the top five for the last three years it was certainly a dent to the ego, with the Masters now just around the corner. Rose’s solution to his miserable form — three missed cuts and a 55th-place finish at the Cadillac Championship in four PGA Tour starts — was the time-honoured one. For the past two weeks, the 34-year-old has spent long hours on the practice ground. Justin Rose hit 17 out of 18 greens in regulation and signed for a 69 at the Shell Houston Open . In the first round of the Shell Houston Open on Thursday there were encouraging signs his decline will prove temporary. Rose hit 17 out of 18 greens in regulation and signed for a 69, the same score as his playing partner, the ever- consistent Jordan Spieth. ‘It’s certainly a welcome return to the sixties, for it had been a while,’ said Rose, smiling. On a day when American Scott Piercy went round in 63 and Phil Mickelson enjoyed his best round in months with a 66, it was hardly surprising the only reporter waiting to talk to Rose was this one. But under the radar is never a bad place to be going to the Masters. The boom and bust years that characterised the first half of Rose’s career meant there was never going to be any feelings of panic following his unusually poor run in the Sunshine State. ‘There’s no doubt I lost my game there but the Florida swing can be unforgiving if you’re slightly off,’ he said. ‘Over the past two weeks I feel like I’ve done some good work and whether I finish well or not here I feel like I’m going in the right direction again. ‘Basically I was getting ahead of the ball at impact, and shots were going left or right, the irons were not solid and the new putter was not working. So we’ve corrected the faults and I’ve gone back to the old putter.’ Phil Mickelson enjoyed his best round in months with a 66 on Thursday . Does he pay much attention to the world rankings? ‘You notice, for sure,’ he said. ‘I’m very proud of the fact I’ve been in the world’s top five for practically the whole of the last three years. It’s a nice ego thing, so by the end of the year I’m hoping there won’t be any slippage. ‘But right now, I’ve got to focus on my game in the knowledge that the rankings change fast when you’re playing well. I’m in all the tournaments I want to be in, so there’s no need to worry on that score. Typically, your good years are built around four or five really good weeks, so you have to stay patient.’ He’d certainly love for one of those good weeks to be the next one. Rose paid a reconnaissance visit to Augusta last Monday and felt the same old thrill. ‘It’s such a treat to enjoy it when it is quiet, you still pinch yourself,’ he said. ‘I think if I’d had a crystal ball when I was 13 or 14 and it had said I’d get to play Augusta every year, I’d have been very happy with that.’ He’s certainly had his share of adventures during his nine appearances to date. Rose might be the only player in Masters history to have led or had a share of the lead after every round bar the last one. His best chance so far of finishing on top after 72 holes came in 2007, when he stood on the 17th hole tied for the lead only to run up a fatal double-bogey six. Paul Casey celebrated his last-gasp Masters invitation with two eagle threes in a fine round of 68 . ‘The Masters has probably been less on my mind this year because I am trying to find some form,’ he admitted. ‘But I think the fact I’ve had a number of great rounds there will always stand me in good stead. Regardless of what happens here, I feel comfortable on that course and know I can manage my game even if it’s not 100 per cent. You draw off the energy of the place.’ Mickelson has certainly done that over the years and perhaps the veteran lefty, a three-time Masters champion, is gearing himself up for another run at the green jacket. ‘It was a good start to the tournament and now I’m looking for three more good rounds,’ he said. 'This is a big week for me. I felt the game was close last week. The only thing missing was chipping and short game.' Paul Casey, like Mickelson another former winner of this event, celebrated his last-gasp Masters invitation with a fine round of 68 notable for two eagle threes. In the afternoon wave, Padraig Harrington and Lee Westwood both made good starts to play their first six holes in two under.",Justin Rose bounced back from Florida misery by carding 69 in Houston .

"There was no special treatment for Lewis Ferguson at Paul Nicholls’ yard on Thursday morning. The 18-year-old was mucking out the stables as usual, just a cut on the nose to show for the fall which has made him an internet sensation. Ferguson, whose double somersault horror fall from the favourite Merrion Square in the 4.20pm at Wincanton on Wednesday has been watched hundreds of thousands of times online. But he was back riding out and said he was undeterred from getting back in the sadal. ‘It was just a blur,’ he said, ‘I couldn’t work out what had happened until I got back to the weighing room and watched the replay.

"When emergency crews received a call saying 'someone' had been knocked down by a car in Essex, they immediately sent two ambulances to the rescue. But the vehicles returned to base just moments later when the caller revealed the 'victim' was actually a squirrel that had been run over in Epping Forest.

"A loving boyfriend has granted his girlfriend her birthday wish of having their wedding photographs taken - even though they can't officially get married yet because she is bedridden in hospital. Guo Kai and girlfriend Dong Hui, who turned 22 on Monday, had been planning to get married this month in Sichuan in southwest China.

"(CNN)Sunday's announcement that Corinthian Colleges Inc. would shut down all of its remaining 28 campuses is a positive development in a long struggle to hold for-profit colleges accountable. Corinthian, which once enrolled more than 70,000 students, is one of the worst of the ""predator colleges"" -- schools that offer dubious degrees, saddle students with high amounts of debt and gobble up tens of billions of dollars in federal money every year. Many of these schools are for-profit career colleges that operate mostly online. It's no wonder that Corinthian is doing this after the U.S. Department of Education curtailed its access to federal student aid last summer. There are about 1.3 million students enrolled in for-profit colleges, many of which have questionable track records, and their students need help transitioning into legitimate postsecondary schools. With Uncle Sam's student loan debt sheet topping $1 trillion, we literally can't afford to continue funding for-profit colleges -- which reportedly get 86% of their funding from federal student loan money. For those not familiar with the for-profit college fiasco, here's the whole story in one telling statistic: While for-profit colleges enroll only 13% of the nation's college students, such colleges account for nearly half of all student loan defaults, according to Department of Education statistics. For comparison's sake, the default rate of for-profit college students is worse than the default rate of the worst subprime borrowers during the financial crisis. How do these colleges operate? It's deviously simple: Convince low-income students into borrowing tens of thousands of dollars through easy federal student loans, keep costs low through online classes and part-time professors, and watch the money roll in. The aggressive tactics of these colleges boggle the mind. Recruiters are told to make 100 phone calls and leave 100 messages a day, according to a ProPublica investigation. I can personally attest to the aggressive tactics. My phone number was accidentally placed on a call list for a for-profit college recently, and I received so many calls per day that I had to ask my wireless carrier to block the phone number. Stopping the exploitation of students isn't easy. The for-profit college business is a multibillion-dollar industry. The CEOs of these companies make millions of dollars a year, employ an army of lobbyists and donate money to both political parties. But the past two months brought a new twist to the crisis. Hundreds of graduates of the now-defunct Corinthian joined a ""debt strike,"" publicly declaring their refusal to pay back their loans. In response, Education Department Secretary Arne Duncan signaled a willingness to forgive loans of Corinthian graduates who have crushing debt and no job prospects. Now that Corinthian is finally shutting down, we must finish the job. The remaining for-profit colleges should be closed. Any student not gainfully employed or transferred to a reputable college within three years should be considered a victim, and their debts should be forgiven. Yes, ""victim"" is the right word. If these degrees actually helped people get jobs, we should be celebrating them. But according to a jaw-dropping report by the Education Department, the average graduate of an online for-profit college makes less than a high school dropout. Not the equivalent of a high school dropout. Less than a high school dropout. The real-life misery caused by predatory colleges is painful to hear about. One Corinthian graduate has $37,000 in debt for his computer science degree, but he can't even get a job at Best Buy, according to Slate. Another graduate, $33,000 in debt, has a medical assisting degree, but she gave up on finding employment in her field. She waits tables now, The Chronicle of Higher Education says. I can already hear your next question. If for-profit colleges are this terrible, are they at least cheaper? No. In fact, their cost is reportedly around 60% higher than a comparable degree from a public college. What's even more frustrating is that we've known about the shenanigans of these predator colleges for years. A 2011 report by the Government Accountability Office found widespread rule breaking by the largest for-profit colleges -- everything from accepting fictitious high-school diplomas to encouraging plagiarism and cheating. In one example, an undercover federal investigator posing as a student was told by a professor, ""It's not hard to get a 100% on the second try; just jot down the correct answers and take the quiz again,"" according to The New York Times. In 2013, Career Education Corp. paid $10 million to settle charges by the state of New York regarding phony job-placement claims. All told, no fewer than 36 state attorneys general were investigating for-profit colleges in 2014. After selling off 95 of its campuses last year, Corinthian said on Sunday that it tried unsuccessfully to sell the remaining 28 campuses, blaming the failure on ""federal and state regulators seeking to impose financial penalties and conditions"" on potential buyers. You can't hide your bad behavior forever, and the questionable practices of many for-profit colleges are starting to catch up with them. Enrollment at the University of Phoenix -- the largest for-profit college in the United States -- has fallen by half, to about 213,000. We laid the smackdown on predatory lenders during the financial crisis, and it's time to do the same thing with for-profit colleges. To keep predator colleges from wrecking our faith in the college degree -- still the best pathway to a middle-class life -- we need to act now. For-profit colleges have flunked their final exam. Now it's up to their rich benefactor, Uncle Sam, to make sure they don't go back to school in the fall. Editor's Note: An earlier version of this article said the San Diego campus of the University of Phoenix had been banned from enrolling military veterans last year; that issue has been resolved.","David Wheeler: Corinthian, considered a ""predator"" school, will shut down campuses .

"Boston (CNN)The Boston Marathon is traditionally an event in which people in and around the Massachusetts capital come together, celebrate and enjoy. But not in 2013, when three people died and over 200 were injured when a pair of bombs went off within 12 seconds of each other at the finish line. And not this year -- at least not if you're a member of the jury that convicted Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in the bombings. That's what federal Judge George A. O'Toole told jurors Tuesday, stressing the importance of avoiding anything that could be prejudicial in the trial's sentencing phase. That begins April 21, a day after this year's edition of the landmark race. ""Do not attend the Boston Marathon or any events or gatherings related to the anniversary or the current running of the Boston Marathon,"" O'Toole said in court. The judge spoke for less than 10 minutes, and stressed the seriousness of his warnings. The first phase of Tsarnaev's trial began March 4, after which federal prosecutors called 92 witnesses, and the defense just four. Timeline of the bombings, manhunt and aftermath . Tsarnaev's lawyers never disputed that their client was at the scene of the bombings and part of the days-long mayhem that followed. Tsarnaev lawyer Judy Clarke acknowledged in opening arguments that: ""It was him."" But Clarke argued that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev only took part in the plot under the influence of his brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who died after the bombings, but before his brother was captured in a boat parked in a Watertown backyard, . That argument wasn't enough to sway the jury, though. Rather, they convicted Dzhokhar Tsarnaev on all 30 counts he faced -- including using weapons of mass destruction, bombing a place of public use, conspiracy and aiding and abetting. A look at all of the charges . The only question now, short of a successful appeal of that verdict, is what price he'll now pay. The maximum penalty for several of the charges is death. Talking to the jury on Tuesday, O'Toole predicted that the sentencing phase will last four weeks before cautioning that forecasting a specific timetable is less reliable than guessing the weather. The plan is for the court to be in session for four days a week, as long as the process takes. Until then, O'Toole told the jurors, ""Please put the case out of your minds. Enjoy the warm weather."" What's next for Tsarnaev? CNN's Ann O'Neill reported from Boston. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet, Alexandra Field, Aaron Cooper, Kevin Conlon, Jason Hanna and Steve Almasy contributed to this report.","Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found guilty of all 30 counts, may face death penalty .

"Vowing to cling on: Liberal Democrats leader Nick Clegg makes a speech during a General Election campaign visit to Sutton in south London yesterday . Nick Clegg yesterday vowed to cling on as Liberal Democrat leader even if the party is wiped out at the polls. Friends of the Deputy Prime Minister have previously indicated that he will quit as leader if the Lib Dems are reduced to fewer than 30 MPs, while sources have also suggested he will go if the party is left out of power after the election. But yesterday he insisted he would fight for his job ‘in all circumstances’. He told Sky News: ‘I’m really optimistic about the prospects of Liberal Democrats. 'Of course I want to continue to serve the country and serve my party, which I am so proud to have served for seven or eight years now.’ He added: ‘I want to lead the Liberal Democrats into and through the next Parliament in all circumstances. ‘All I am focused on at the moment is sounding the alarm about the very, very real risk that as the Labour Party and Conservative Party vacate the centre ground and hare off in which direction after another, there is a very real risk we undo all the sacrifices and hard work that have gone in over the last five years to put the country back on track economically.’ Meet and greet: Mr Clegg (far right) speaks to voters and their families during a General Election campaign visit to Sutton with Paul Burstow (second right) the party's candidate for Sutton and Cheam . His comments came as Business Secretary Vince Cable said he hoped to be made Chancellor if the Lib Dems form another coalition with the Conservatives. Mr Clegg also appeared to lean towards another deal with the Tories, saying he deserved ‘credit’ for forming the Coalition while he had endured ‘five years of constant bile from the Labour Party, who condemned us vitriolically for taking decisions which we only had to take because we had to clear up the mess they left behind’.",Sources claimed he'd go if Lib Dems are reduced to fewer than 30 MPs .

"Paul Gregory, 51, of Bedford, has been fined £795 for having a blue badge, claiming he could only walk 200 metres, when in fact he was a keen walker . A disability badge holder who claimed he could only walk 200 metres ended up in court after council officials noticed a newspaper report recounting his exploits on a 191-mile hike. When Paul Gregory, 51, applied to renew his blue badge, he claimed exercise left him breathless, despite being a keen walker and member of a mountaineering club. He was exposed when Bedford Borough Council staff read an article in The Westmorland Gazette,  describing how the 'experienced walker' had been attacked by cows in Cumbria on the third day of a hike in 2012. The article, which featured a picture of him dressed in walking gear, told how he was knocked over by four cows in a field at the edge of Shap in Cumbria. The council also found he had spent a weekend walking in Wales days before making a blue badge application. Gregory, of Bedford, pleaded guilty to two counts of dishonestly obtaining a blue badge by misrepresenting his physical abilities at Luton Magistrates' Court. He was fined £795, ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work and pay a £60 victim surcharge. He was also subject to a one year supervision order and told to undergo 19 sessions of 'thinking skills'. A Bedford Borough Council spokesman said it was one of the 'most outrageous cases' of blue badge fraud it had investigated. He said: 'He was taking part in national walking trips that many able-bodied adults would find difficult. 'Mr Gregory's abuse of the scheme is completely unacceptable and we will continue to investigate all reports of blue badge fraud thoroughly.'

"Apple offers a range of ways to unlock its devices from PINs to passwords and fingerprints. But you could soon use a selfie to gain access to your apps and messages thanks to Apple's latest patent. The filing details a system of scanning a user's face with the front-facing camera when the handset is moved into a certain position, and automatically unlocking the device if the image matches one on file. The patent (illustrated) was filed by the California-based firm in March 2011 and awarded earlier this week. It details a method of scanning a user's face using the front-facing camera each time the phone is moved into a certain position. If the scanned face matches a previously taken photo, the phone unlocks automatically . The patent was filed by the Californian tech giant in March 2011 and awarded earlier this week. Called 'Locking and unlocking a mobile device using facial recognition', the patent explains that current methods of unlocking a device are 'inconvenient and time consuming'. Apple's patent details a method for automatically unlocking a mobile device using a system comprising of 'capturing an initial image  while the device is locked, monitoring a motion state of the mobile device to determine whether the device is moving or is motionless;  analysing the images to detect a user's face and unlocking the device.' Android Lollipop users already have an almost identical feature known as Trusted face in the Smart Lock menu. It is an extension of Face Unlock that launched on Android Ice Cream Sandwich. Once the screen is enabled and the camera is held in front of the face, the screen automatically unlocks. This relies on the user pressing the power button to enable the screen. By comparison it appears that Apple's proposed system would track the movement of the phone to determine whether it is being used, or is placed flat on a table.

By comparison, it appears that Apple's proposed system would track the movement of the phone to determine whether it is being used, or is placed flat on a table. The screen wouldn't need to be enabled. Instead, once the phone is moved and positioned in front of the face the camera would begin scanning. It will only unlock if the angle of the face matches, or is similar to, the one that was initially taken to avoid the phone unlocking simply when the phone is near a face. As Apple explained: 'In one embodiment, the image is analysed for a facial profile of a human face, without regard to a specific user. Apple's proposed system tracks the movement of the phone to determine whether it is being used, or is placed flat on a table (flow chart shown). The screen wouldn't need to be enabled. Instead, once the phone is moved and positioned in front of the face the camera would begin scanning for a face .

Once the screen is enabled and the camera is held in front of the face, the screen automatically unlocks. The face icon between the Whatsapp and Chrome logo (right) shows the feature is enabled . 'In this case, the device will only need to determine that a human facial profile is present.' It continued that once an allotted period of time has elapsed and a user's face is not detected in any of the images, the device stays locked. 'In another embodiment, detecting the user's face may also include verifying that the user is an authorised user of the device,' the files continued. 'Trusted face' and Smart Lock are extensions of the Face Unlock feature that was launched on Android Ice Cream Sandwich (pictured). This relies on the user pressing the power button to enable the screen . 'The predetermined facial profile may be determined from an image that was previously captured by the device's camera and stored in a storage of images of authorised users.' Chip maker Qualcomm has unveiled its Sense ID 3D fingerprint scanner - the first biometric sensor using ultrasonic technology. It uses ultrasonic sound waves to capture the ridges, sweat pores and more on the tip of a finger in greater detail than capacitive touch ID sensors seen on the likes of Apple and Samsung devices. This not only makes it more accurate than other sensors, but it will also work even if the user’s hands are wet or have dirt or lotions on it, for example. Phones running Sense ID are expected to launch later this year, but Qualcomm did not reveal to MailOnline which devices or manufacturers it is working with. The patent also suggests this feature could be used by multiple users, in the way that multiple fingerprints can be added to its current Touch ID system. 'In this case, the database of images of authorised users would contain an image for each  user,' it added. 'To match a facial profile in the subsequent image, the device would have to compare the subsequent image to each image in the database. 'Furthermore, each authorised user may have an associated unlocking profile in the database that indicates what functions or applications of the device are enabled when the device is unlocked.' Phone makers are looking for alternative ways to secure devices while making them faster and more convenient to open. For example, Fujitsu recently demonstrated its iris scanning prototype that lets people access phones, apps and online accounts by staring at an infrared sensor. This would work in a similar way to facial recognition, but is more secure and unique to an individual user.

"The mother of a mentally ill daughter who killed herself last month has revealed how her condition worsened over years and eventually drove her to suicide. Doris Fuller's daughter, Natalie, 28, suffered from bipolar disorder and psychosis, and died when she stepped in front of a train in Baltimore, Maryland, last month. And in the wake of her death, Fuller has written about how her illness, which went undiagnosed until her early 20s, and said she was 'the bravest person I have ever known'. Scroll down for video . Opening up: Doris Fuller's daughter Natalie, left with her mom, killed herself last month - and now Fuller has opened up about how Natalie's bipolar disorder and psychosis led to her death . The mother and daughter pair had shot to fame in 2004 when they collaborated on a parenting guide based on Natalie being totally honest with her mother about whatever she was asked. Bestseller: Natalie opened up to her mom - and the result was this popular parenting book . In a long article about her daughter's life for the Washington Post, Fuller wrote how their famously close relationship was changed for good when Natalie had her first psychotic episode at the age of 22, after she had left for college. Fuller wrote: 'In the span of a few weeks she went from being a dazzling young adult with the world at her feet to a psych-ward patient with an arrest record.' Summarizing her last years, she said: 'My daughter lived more than six years with an incurable disease that filled her head with devils that literally hounded her to death, and she did it while laughing, painting, writing poetry, advocating and bringing joy to the people around her. 'She was the bravest person I have ever known, and her suicide doesn’t change that.' And though medicines and proper treatment gave Natalie her life back for a time, she eventually decided to stop taking her meds, which brought her troubles back, even more acute than before. In a mental health documentary video filmed in 2014, Natalie described the worst lows of her condition, in which she said terrifyingly real voices would tell her to hurt herself. She told the cameras: 'I believed that everything happening to me was real, and I thought that I was acting fine. 'But my mom and my brother and everyone around me could see something that I couldn't see. 'Even though [the voices] were telling me to hurt myself and do horrible things to myself, I still listened to them because I had a relationship with them. I thought they were real.' Although Natalie, a keen artist who sculpted, painted and wrote poetry, often seemed fine while on medication, Fuller told how her future seemed a little bleaker every time she relapsed. Difficulties: Natalie (left in 2014) was not diagnosed with a mental health problem until she was 22 - before then she had a regular childhood (right). She told how as she grew older voices started telling her to harm herself . Growing up: As a teenager, Natalie's no-holds-barred honesty helped make her mom a bestseller . She wrote: 'If she even inadvertently missed a few days of medication - even while receiving therapy and other forms of treatment - the demons would return, and one of the first things they would tell her was to stop taking her medicine. 'The second thing they would tell her was not to talk to her mom, the most powerful other influence in her life. 'Each time she obeyed and relapsed, she plunged into a longer free fall, hitting the ground harder, recovering more slowly and returning at a lower plateau.' According to the article, the final, ultimately fatal, change came last fall when Natalie concluded that the drugs were not helping her at all, and gave them up for good. Fuller was not specific about what happened in Natalie's last weeks, though in a post on a tribute site to her daughter, she mentioned that she had holidayed in Nicaragua with members of her family in February. Fuller, the executive director of the Treatment Advocacy Center charity has said since Natalie's death that she wants her 'legacy' to be increased understanding and compassion for the those who have mental illnesses.

"So, once again, it will all come down to the actions of a man from Salto. On this occasion, though, the focus will not be on Salto’s most famous son. Luis Suarez will be at the Parc des Princes tonight, forming one part of football’s most famous three-man attack, looking to fire Barcelona into the Champions League semi-finals. Usually when they reach this stage, Barcelona do not make any mistakes. Standing on the other side of the pitch will be someone who Suarez knows inside out, a player who hails from his home city in Uruguay and with whom he has shared a number of big nights when representing their country. Edinson Cavani prepares for Paris Saint-Germain's quarter-final clash with Barcelona . PSG train at Camp-des-Loges in Saint-Germain-en-Laye, west of Paris . Cavani celebrates scoring for the Paris side in the League Cup final last weekend . Edinson Cavani knows the spotlight will be shining on him this evening. If Paris Saint-Germain are to break through the glass ceiling and progress beyond the Champions League’s last eight, Cavani – a player known as El Matador – must torment the stars from Catalonia. The onus falls on Cavani for a number of reasons. First, PSG have been stripped by suspension of two key players, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Marco Veratti, the product of that ugly last 16 success against Chelsea; Thiago Motta is injured, while David Luiz is also a major doubt. Yet there is more to it than that. Cavani has a towering reputation in the game, stemming from three prolific seasons in Naples which led to his record-breaking move to Paris, but can you think of a really vital game that he has stamped his class all over? To suggest that may seem a little harsh. He came within the width of a goal post at Stamford Bridge of being the undisputed match winner and his bullet header in the first leg in February that gave Laurent Blanc’s side the opportunity to travel to London with parity. Since then, however, Cavani has endured problems and a significant goal drought for one of his talent. Between February 17 and April 5, Cavani went seven matches without scoring and only ended the fallow spell with a double as a substitute in the Coupe de Ligue final on Saturday. PSG won that game 4-0 but had matters sewn up before Cavani came on and helped himself to a double late on (Ibrahimovic had scored twice to give them breathing space); it was his first action since an angry altercation with Blanc a week earlier during a 3-2 win in Marseille. Zlatan Ibrahimovic slides in on Oscar during PSG's second round clash at Chelsea last month . Ibrahimovic is shown the red card for his challenge on Oscar to leave PSG up against it . Ibrahimovic trudges off the field and will miss the first leg of the quarter-final against Barcelona . It has led to speculation about his future in Paris and he has been linked with a number of sides in the Barclays Premier League; Liverpool, for one, would have loved to have signed him last summer but the figures were exorbitant (he earns more per week than Radamel Falcao). Arsenal and Manchester United have also been mentioned with him, while Manchester City tested the water in June 2013 when it was clear that Cavani’s time in Serie A was over; the intensity of his play, you suspect, would enhance his prospects of thriving in the English game. Nasser Al Khelaifi, PSG’s president, maintains one of the jewels in their crown will not be sold this summer but the recent noises Cavani has made have not been ultra-enthusiastic and hint that he might be ready for a new challenge after two years in France. ‘I came to play as a centre-forward with Zlatan and after, things changed for a variety of reasons,’ said Cavani. ‘Everything else is perfect in Paris. The club has behaved very well towards me. I have had some difficult moments personally, and they protected me, supported me. ‘The fans have also always supported me. I think I'm in one of the best places in the world. I'm staying focused on my preparation to give my best for my team, to the club that pays me and has shown faith in me. You never know in football. I'm not thinking about it.’ Tonight his focus will be on Barcelona. With six goals in eight Champions League appearances this season – he averages one every 143 minutes and has created 10 chances for his team-mates – it would be risible to suggest Cavani has something to prove on this stage. That said, it might not be wrong to suggest he needs a big moment. Ibrahimovic’s ability to sprinkle stardust is beyond question, while Veratti is fast becoming one of the finest midfielders in Europe but, without them, PSG need their man from Salto to sparkle. Their prospects depend on him. Louis van Gaal is considering a move for Cavani after seeing Radamel Falcao struggle this season .

"Time fries when you're having fun. Dedicated waitress Judy Eddingfield, 65, celebrated her 50th anniversary working at Winstead's restaurant in Kansas City last week and declares that it's the only job's she's ever had or ever wanted. 'It's like my home away from home and I just love it here,' Eddingfield told Fox. Scroll down for video . Dedicated employee: For most of her life Judy Eddingfield has been employed as a server at Winstead's in Kansas City and says it's the only job she's ever had or ever wanted . Is that you? A staff member at Winstead's said she believes one of the women in this photograph is Judy when she first started working at the restaurant . Classic establishment:  This is a photo of the The Winstead family who own the restaurant showing up for work in 1940 around the time when Judy Eddingfield's mother started working there . Eddingfield says she remembers when French fries and a classic Coca-Cola cost just 65 cents at the same restaurant she's worked at for half-a-century. For Eddingfield, slinging burgers with a smile is a family tradition. On April, 6, 1965 Eddinngfield began working at the restaurant where she was trained by her mother who had already been employed at the establishment for 13 years. Eddingfield said that her first day on the job when she was just 15-years-old she spilled a shake all over a woman's fur coat and thought for sure that she'd be fired. 'The tray tipped over and vanilla malt slid down a lady’s fur coat. I was so embarrassed,' Eddingfield told the Kansas City Star 'Of course, she hollered,' said Eddingfield. All was forgiven after Winstead's, open since 1940, got the coat cleaned. Eddingfield along with many of her siblings continued to provide top notch service. Loves to serve: Judy Eddingfield says that her kind customers are what make her job worthwhile . Lots of love: Winstead's honored Judy Eddingfield last week for her wonderful 50 years of working at the classic burger restaurant . 'I had two brothers, my sister, my mother, two aunts, two cousins and lots of friends that have worked here,' said Eddingfield. 'I was three years old when my mother started here, so I've been eating these burger 60 some years.' Eddingfield says she even met her first husband outside the restaurant and they married 18 months later. The Kansas City Star reports that one of Eddingfield's favorite Winstead’s memories was when Jerry Mathers and Tony Dow of the television series 'Leave It to Beaver' came to eat there in the late 1970's. She said that Mathers was 'talking with his hands' and knocked sent his food flying everywhere. Marriage: Judy Eddingfield even met her true love who she calls 'Frog' at Winstead's and the pair married 18-months-later . Celebration: Dedicated waitress Judy Eddingfield celebrated her 50th anniversary working at Winstead's restaurant in Kansas City last week and declares that it's the only job's she's ever had or ever wanted . 'Leave it to Beaver,' his on-screen brother said jokingly, almost as though it were scripted. On a scarier note, Eddingfield says she once was closing up the restaurant when a man started knocking on the door with a gun. She called 911 and hid in the bathroom until the police arrived. Eddingfield's employees say that as she gets older Eddingfield gets more delightful and that she is always willing to share her knowledge of the business. 'She trained me to be her. Pleasant as she is, prompt. So that people will come here for you and continue to come,' said server Sue Allen who has been there for 13 years. Close knit team: Eddingfield, pictured with some of her coworkers, has a passion for serving food . Nothing's changed!: Winstead's when it first opened in 1940 has an almost identical style to the Winstead's that's here today . Eddingfield's biggest tip she ever received was a generous man who treated his entire staff in 2014 and staff agree it was well deserved. Eddigfield turns 66 on May 13 and though she is getting older, she plans to keep on working as long as she is healthy. When asked why she chose to stay at the establishment for so long, she replied that the customers make her job worthwhile. 'The customers really make it special,' she says. General manager Kathi Fern says that Eddingfield is one of her best employees. 'It's just amazing the way she treats her customers,' said Fern. 'I call her my dinosaur. She's a dying breed and there will never be servers like her again.' said Fern of her dedicated employee. Classic drive-thru: Winstead's was established in 1940 and to this day is known for serving quality burgers at their drive-thru .","'It's like my home away from home and I just love it here,' Judy Eddingfield said of Winstead's in Kansas City .

"Microsoft has a new pilot program to hire people with autism for full-time positions within the company. The announcement was made on the company's blog by Microsoft Corporate VP of Worldwide Operations, Mary Ellen Smith, who has a teenage son, Shawn, with autism. The positions will be based at its Redmond campus in Washington and the program will be run in partnership with Specialisterne, a Danish nonprofit that helps train people with autism for careers in IT. Smith wrote on the blog: 'It's simple, Microsoft is stronger when we expand opportunity and we have a diverse workforce that represents our customers.' The announcement was made on the company's blog by Microsoft Corporate VP of Worldwide Operations, Mary Ellen Smith, who has a teenage son, Shawn, with autism . 'The day my son was diagnosed I distinctly remember the final words of two doctors I overheard as my husband and I left the medical center, ""I think they understand."" 'I also remember how we walked to the car, pulled onto the road, drove 15 miles to our home, and entered the house. All in silence. We did not know what to say. 'But we do now. What we learned over the last 15 years was to find our voice. To model what a unique advantage a young man like my son Shawn can offer. 'To think of where he is now, a college freshman and part-time employee, and where he has the potential to go, makes my husband and I so proud. The positions will be based at its Redmond campus in Washington and the program will be run in partnership with Specialisterne, a Danish nonprofit that helps train people with autism for careers in IT . She added: 'I am also proud of how our society and our workplace is moving forward with the commitment to help support people with autism and disabilities in general.' Last year Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was forced to apologize for saying that women don't need to ask for a raise and should just trust the system to pay them well. Nadella was blasted on Twitter and in blog posts for his comments, which were made at an event for women in computing. He had been asked to give his advice to women who are uncomfortable requesting a raise. His response: 'It's not really about asking for the raise, but knowing and having faith that the system will actually give you the right raises as you go along.' Microsoft is now focusing on diversity. Last year Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella (pictured) was forced to apologize for saying that women don't need to ask for a raise and should just trust the system to pay them well . Not asking for raise, he added, is 'good karma' that would help a boss realize that the employee could be trusted and should have more responsibility. Still, his comments at the event, the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing, underscored why many see technology companies as workplaces that are difficult to navigate or even unfriendly for women and minorities. Tech companies, particularly the engineering ranks, are overwhelmingly male, white and Asian. Criticized for their lack of diversity, major companies say they are trying to address the problem with programs such as employee training sessions and by participating in initiatives meant to introduce girls to coding. Twenty-nine percent of Microsoft's employees are women, according to figures the company released last year. Its technical and engineering staff and its management are just 17 percent female. That's roughly comparable to diversity data released by other big tech companies last year. Commenting on Microsoft's decision Sarah Lambert, Head of Policy at the National Autistic Society, told Daily Mail Online: 'It's encouraging to see a global company like Microsoft recognise the untapped potential of adults with autism and we hope that other organisations follow their lead. 'Autism is a spectrum condition and many people may have strengths such as accuracy, a good eye for detail and reliability, which can benefit all sorts of businesses, not just the technology industry.'","Microsoft Corporate VP of Worldwide Operations, Mary Ellen Smith, who has a teenage son Shawn with autism, made the announcement .

"Zara Phillips has revealed how she got her fitness back after the birth of her first child Mia - by hitting the exercise bike every morning before her daughter even woke up. The 33-year-old, who is vying for a place on Team GB at the Rio Olympics, welcomed Mia Grace with husband Mike Tindall last year. But after finding herself 'surprised' by how her fitness dropped during pregnancy, the Queen's granddaughter has committed to a strict exercise and diet regime to get back in shape. Scroll down for video . Zara Phillips has told of how she was surprised at how difficult it was to regain her fitness after the birth of her daughter, Mia, one (pictured left in January and right, last July when Mia was six months old) 'What surprised me about having a baby is losing all your fitness and how tough it is to get it back to that level again,' she said in an interview with The Sunday Time Magazine. Starting her morning at 7am, Zara has a breakfast of Greek yogurt and honey and tries to get in a stint on the exercise bike at her home, Gatcombe Park, before Mia wakes at 8am. Her day is then typically spent with the horses kept at her mother, Princess Anne's stables, before squeezing in another workout. 'Lunch is quick and simple, like soup and a sandwich or eggs and toast. I don't diet but I try to eat well and not to eat too many carbohydrates or sugary things. Zara (pictured competing in the 2012 London Games) said she is keen to win a place on Team GB in 2016 .

The one-year-old's father previously revealed the couple had 'three Shetland ponies waiting for her'. Speaking in an interview in January, Mr Tindall, who has recently taken part in the reality skiing show The Jump, said: 'Eventing children have to be very relaxed. 'You are going to travel around a lot.' Earlier this year Zara told of how little Mia enjoyed playing with her royal relatives Prince George and her cousins, Savannah and Isla. Speaking to Daily Mail Australia at Magic Millions Race Day in January she said of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge: 'We've all got small ones now so it's great fun.'

"In recent years, Iceland has become an increasingly popular filming location with its majestic vistas being prominently featured in many hit TV series or Hollywood blockbusters. Despite the fact that Iceland has been used in filming as far back as 1920, well-known fantasy, sci-fi and action film directors and producers have all descended on the island nation as of late, prompting the quick development of 17 production services companies nationwide. Although the country's many stunning waterfalls and breathtaking glaciers translate beautifully to the silver screen, there are certain filming locations that consistently rank a cut above and are drawing fans of productions such as Game of Thrones, Interstellar or Prometheus. Thingvellir National Park provided the location for the North of Westeros in Game of Thrones . Fans will likely recognise the National Park as the setting of the battle of the Hound and Brienne . The black volcanic landscapes of Svartalfheim provided the filmmakers of Thor: The Dark World with the perfect otherworldly setting, as outlined in this Icelandair infographic. Meanwhile, Clint Eastwood opted to film battle scenes for both Letters from Iwo Jima and Flags of Our Fathers in Iceland – specifically along the dramatic cliffs of the Reykjanes Peninsula, just a quick drive from the capital. Scenes from Christopher Nolan’s epic Interstellar were filmed atop the blue ice glacier Svinafellsjokull in the Skaftafell National Park, which is also located near another favoured filming location: Iceland’s largest glacier, Vatnajokull. The Svinafellsjokull glacier provided a stunning setting for Christopher Nolan's epic film, Interstellar . Interstellar tells the tale of explorers who travel in search of a new planet to sustain the human race . Europe's most powerful waterfall, the Dettifoss, was used in the opening scenes of Prometheus . In Prometheus, the rushing waterfall in the background is meant to help depict the beginning of time . 'Interstellar was my second time filming in Iceland and it was another worldly experience,' the director told Film In Iceland. 'Iceland truly represents the beautiful extremes the nature has to offer.' Not to be left out, Ridley Scott scouted Europe’s most powerful waterfall, the Dettifoss, for the opening scenes depicting the beginning of time in Prometheus. And finally, Game of Thrones enthusiasts will undoubtedly recognise the north of Iceland, namely Thingvellir National Park, from Arya’s storyline and as the setting of the battle of the Hound and Brienne, in the North of Westeros. The Jokullsarlon lake, at the foot of the massive massive Vatnajokull glacier, is another favoured filming spot .","Iceland has become an increasingly popular filming location recently .

"The family of conjoined twin sisters who died 19 days after they were born have been left mortified after they arrived at their gravesite to find cemetery staff had cleared the baby section of all mementos and tossed them in the rubbish. Faith and Hope Howie were dubbed the miracle twins when they were born on May 8 last year with one body and two faces due to an extremely rare condition known as disrosopus. They died in hospital less than a month after they were born and their parents, Simon Howie and Renee Young, laid them to rest at Pinegrove Memorial Park in Sydney's west. Scroll down for video . Faith and Hope Howie were dubbed the miracle twins when they were born on May 8 last year with one body and two faces due to an extremely rare condition known as disrosopus . Family members have visited the grave every week to leave mementos and flowers for Faith and Hope, but when Mr Howie and Ms Young arrived on Thursday they found the site completely bare. 'We took Renee's aunts to see the girls for the first time and we found everything had been stripped away,' Mr Howie told Daily Mail Australia. 'We were devastated and mortified. We've had a little shrine set up and we've been adding to it since the funeral. 'It's heartbreaking to know we've set this up and it has been treated like rubbish.'

Family members have visited the grave every week to leave mementos and flowers for Faith and Hope, but when parents Simon Howie and Renee Young arrived on Thursday they found the site completely bare . Faith and Hope's parents confronted staff from the cemetery and were told they were supposed to have been notified they are would be cleaned. They found their daughters' belongings in nearby rubbish bins, but were only able to retrieve about 25 percent of their memorabilia. 'There was no warning, it was just manhandled and thrown in the rubbish. It was through the entire baby section.' The couple retrieved what they could find and returned later in the afternoon to see what else they could salvage - by then everything had been laid out on shelves for people to collect. 'We've gone down there and maintained it. We make sure either side of the girls is clipped with scissors to (workers) don't need to go near it,' Mr Howie said.

The girls were transferred to Westmead Children's Hospital shortly after their birth on May 8 where they were closely monitored by doctors and nurses . They passed away just 19 days after they were born - their condition was so rare that only 35 cases have ever been recorded and none survived . 'The collection and storage of ornaments, especially photos, should have been handled much more respectfully and our goal is to improve it for the future,' Pinegrove's communication manager Karl Wolfenden said. 'We do understand the emotions of affected families. We have apologised to those we have spoken to and we have invited them to meet so we can find a solution that is agreeable to all. We are inviting other affected families to make contact also.

"A bitter war of words has erupted between a young woman and a butcher in Sydney's eastern suburbs over exactly what happened when Belinda Bartholomew, the girlfriend of Roosters star Aidan Guerra, tried to buy a chicken to cook up for a Game Of Thrones-inspired feast. According to Ms Bartholomew, she was called names and told to go to 'an Aussie butcher' when she tried to change her chicken selection. However the butcher who was working at the shop on Monday has hit back saying Ms Bartholomew is 'lying' and trying to ruin the business. Scroll down for video . Belinda Bartholomew claims she was racially abused at a Bondi butcher on Monday night when she was buying a chicken for her and her Roosters star boyfriend Aidan Guerra to have for dinner . The war of words started, Ms Bartholomew claims, when the man working at Sam the Butcher in Bondi called her a 'f***ing c***' when she asked for a different chicken to the one he had picked up. There were apparently more problems when she went to use her card to pay for the choice bird. 'His eftpos machine wasn't connecting so it was taking a while to process, and I felt really uncomfortable as he was clearly agitated, huffing and throwing things around,' she said. Ms Bartholomew claims the man working at Sam The Butcher in Bondi swore at her and told her to leave, but the man working at the time said his customer was the one being rude . The chicken (pictured in front of Aidan Guerra) was cooked by Ms Bartholomew as part of a Game Of Thrones-inspired feast . 'Another woman entered the shop at this point and she ordered sausages and paid in cash, and when she asked for a receipt he clearly ignored her on purpose so she actually lent over the counter and printed her own.' However, the butcher vehemently denies he called Ms Bartholomew names and said she was the one being rude on a day when he had been having issues with his eftpos machine. 'She's just a troublemaker,' the butcher told Daily Mail Australia. 'I was very slow and she started having a go at me.' Ms Bartholomew (pictured with Mr Guerra) said the butcher told her to 'go to a f***ing Aussie butcher' But the man working vehemently denied any claims he swore at or abused the young woman (pictured) He told Daily Mail Australia that he's trying to fit into Australian life but sometimes finds it hard to cope with attitudes in Bondi. Ms Bartholomew claims the butcher then asked her 'Why don't you just go to a f***ing Aussie butcher'. 'She said I'm half Italian don't speak to me like that,' the butcher said. 'I said if you're going to be rude to me just take the chicken and go.' 'It's a free country there's about eight butcher shops in Bondi,' he added. Ms Bartholomew (left) and the butcher both said she didn't end up paying for the chicken she and Mr Guerra (right) later ate . Ms Bartholomew said she had decided to leave the shop without making a purchase but the butcher then thrust the chicken at her. 'I said not to worry about it and proceeded to leave while my purchase was still pending so he swiped the 1.5kg chicken at me and told me to ""take it and f*** off"",' she claims. 'I think I was just the victim of racial abuse,' the young Bondi woman wrote in a heated Facebook post shortly afterwards. However the butcher said he simply wanted her out of the shop and did not swear at or abuse her at any stage. 'She didn't even end up paying for the chicken, she got a free chicken,' he said. Ms Bartholomew told Daily Mail Australia 'I have never been to this particular butcher before.'

"All the smiles cannot hide the reality that McCluskey and his union are a potent, sinister force in British politics . Out on the election campaign trail under blue skies in South Wales, the trade union firebrand's manner was as warm as the weather. 'Didn't you once call me a slab-faced Marxist?' the famously militant leader of Unite asked me with a grin that was more genial than menacing. I had to confess I had. But that did not stop 'Red' Len McCluskey giving me the time of day on a street in Neath as he conducted a two-day tour of the Principality to drum up support for Labour's cause. Watching him in action, it was clear that he is highly popular with activists. His gospel of traditional hard-left socialism goes down well with the converted, as does his hackneyed anti-Conservative bile. 'We look to Wales as a beacon of hope to show what a Labour government can do. The Tories might have the money but we've got the working people on our side,' he said to cheers and applause. Yet all the smiles cannot hide the reality that McCluskey and his union are a potent, sinister force in British politics, seeking to use their financial and organisational muscle within the Labour movement to drag Britain back to the dark days of the 1970s. As the Mail reveals today, the sheer scale of the influence Unite holds on scores of Labour candidates is chilling given the socialist revolution the union would seek to impose. Indeed, McCluskey, a former Liverpool dock worker who keeps a drawing of Lenin in his office and once boasted of presiding over more strikes than any other union boss, is quite open about his yearning for that period when the unions held the government to ransom: 'We are supposed to believe that the Seventies was a horrible time. It wasn't. It was a time of great advances for working people,' he has said. Labour's umbilical link to McCluskey's union has received much less attention in recent days than a potential deal with the left-wing, anti-austerity SNP, yet it is just as potentially disastrous for the governance of this country. Not only is Unite – which has a claimed membership of 1.42million – intertwined with the Labour Party's structure, MPs and finances, but it also remains addicted to the failed socialist policies of the past, including a major expansion in the public sector, less flexibility in the workplace, higher taxation and ever more state spending. Just like Nicola Sturgeon, McCluskey wants to make Labour bolder, 'more radical, courageous and brave'. Only last month, he appeared to threaten illegal action if a Tory Government pushed through further restrictions on strikes in the public sector. 'When the law is misguided, when it oppresses people and removes their freedoms, can we respect it? I am not really posing the question, I'm giving the answer. It ain't going to happen,' he declared. Despite all his talk about the oppression of working people, however, he has not done badly for himself. Last year it was revealed he received a £5,000 rise, taking his pay and pensions package to £140,281. McCluskey has denied that he has too much influence over Ed Miliband, adding that Unite is supporting the party '100 per cent' McCluskey's determination to influence Labour was all too evident in Wales. With an air of quasi-regal grandeur, he visited several factories, gave talks to Labour activists and held a number of photo opportunities – including one in Cardiff at the statute of that old champagne socialist Nye Bevan. When I spoke to McCluskey, he downplayed his hardline socialism, instead talking about the need for investment in industry and the economy. And he denied that he had too much influence over Ed Miliband's party: 'If only that were true,' he said, while proclaiming his loyalty to the cause. 'Unite is supporting Labour 100 per cent,' he said, adding that is now campaigning 'all over the country'. Yet there was something synthetic about McCluskey's protestations of support for Labour. As I watched him at close quarters, it became more apparent that he was going through the motions. When asked in an interview with BBC Radio Wales about Miliband's leadership, McCluskey could say only: 'He's doing OK'. Beneath the surface, I have no doubt he longs to hear Ed offering more nakedly socialist policies, rather than trying to appeal to Middle England. Moreover, if Labour and Unite really think that McCluskey is an asset in the election, they are doing their best to keep quiet about it. When I tried to find out McCluskey's schedule for his Welsh visit from any number of Unite and Labour sources, including McCluskey's own press officer, I was greeted with either hostility or silence. No one would give me any information. It was only through persistence and good luck that I managed to track him down, to the outrage of his press officer who asked me paranoiacally: 'How did you find us? Did you fit a tracking device to Len's car?' That kind of anxiety and suspicion shows more than just a lack of confidence. It reveals a fear that, just as with Sturgeon's spendthrift radicalism, the hard-Left dogma of Unite is likely to alienate floating middle-of-the-road voters. Such fears are, of course, only too justified. For this is no small-town demagogue. On the contrary, McCluskey is pivotal to Labour's future because of the stranglehold his union has over the party. It was Unite and the other affiliated unions that ensured Ed Miliband was elected leader in 2010 against his more moderate brother David, who enjoyed greater popularity among Labour MPs and the rank and file. Since 2010, Unite is estimated to have donated at least £14.4million to Labour's coffers. It was Unite and the other affiliated unions that ensured Ed Miliband (pictured left) was elected leader in 2010 against his more moderate brother David (right) The dominance of Unite runs right through Labour's organisation, with huge implications for the make-up of a putative Miliband government. One recent analysis showed that 159 Labour MPs from the last parliament receive sponsorship from Unite or are members of the union, including senior frontbenchers such as Harriet Harman, Angela Eagle, Hilary Benn and Sadiq Khan. In addition, 133 Labour candidates at this election are reported to have links to Unite. As Martin Mayer, chairman of Unite's political committee and a member of Labour's National Executive recently admitted, the union is involved in a 'serious attempt to win back the party'. Tragically for Britain, there is now a real danger that an incoming Labour government would be forced to lurch even further to the Left, not just by SNP by also by Unite, with Miliband too weak to stand up to those who are determined he will be their puppet in Downing Street.",The scale of influence Unite holds is chilling given what it seeks to impose . It remains addicted to the failed socialist policies of Britain's past . Mr McClusky denies holding too much power over Labour's Ed Miliband .,1f42cfb9302d4528339099a361998a892f3cac5e
"The battle of the batteries is hotting up. Reports claim Google is the latest firm to set up a team dedicated to boosting how long our phones, tablets and even electric cars can run for.

Reports claim Google is the latest firm to set up a team dedicated to boosting how long our phones, tablets and even electric cars (pictured) can run for. Sources told the Wall Street Journal that the four-man team spends its days devising and testing different technologies from the flexible to the wearable . The reports were made by Alistair Barr in the Wall Street Journal. Google has been working on similar projects since 2012 when former Apple battery expert Dr Ramesh Bhardwaj began leading a testing team. Mr Barr explained that Dr. Bhardwaj recently described how 'solid-state, thin-film batteries could be used in smartphones and other mobile devices that are thinner, bendable, wearable and even implantable in the human body.' He also referenced a video for Project Loon that revealed how Google has been working with experts at AllCell Technologies to develop batteries that function at subfreezing temperatures. This is vital for Google's Project Loon balloons designed to float near the stratosphere and provide internet to wider areas.

In a video for Project Loon (pictured), Google revealed it has been working with experts at AllCell Technologies to develop batteries that function at subfreezing temperatures . Fan site AppleInsider recently spotted nine job listings on Apple's official recruitment site in the past month that relate to batteries. These include one for an iOS battery life software engineer (pictured left) and another for iOS software power systems engineer (pictured right) The AllCell technology uses wax and a graphite material, for example, to help lithium-ion batteries absorb heat and spread it across the power pack. Last week, a team of Stanford University chemists unveiled an aluminium battery that can recharge in less than 60 seconds. Apple defines the Apple Watch battery on its Watch product page. It says its all-day battery life is based on 18 hours of use. All-day battery life: This includes 90 time checks, 90 notifications, 45 minutes of app use, and a 30-minute workout with music. Audio playback: The battery will last up to 6.5 hours when playing music. Talk time: Apple said the Watch can be used for up to three hours for calls. Workout: During this test the Watch lasted for seven hours when a workout session was active and the heart rate sensor was on. Watch: When used as a watch the device will last for 48 hours if checked five times an hour. Power reserve: When the Apple Watch's battery  gets low it switches into Power Reserve mode letting users tell the time for up to 72 hours - with four time checks an hour. Charging time: The company said it takes 1.5 hours to charge the Watch to 80% and 2.5 hours for a full charge. Apple's tests were carried out in March 2015 with a pre-production Apple Watch and software paired with an iPhone using pre-production software. Apple said battery life varies with environmental factors, use, configuration, and 'many other factors' so actual results will vary . It is said to be the first high-performance aluminium battery which is 'fast-charging, long-lasting and inexpensive' and is more environmentally friendly than alkaline batteries. It also can't catch fire like lithium-ion technology. At present the rechargeable aluminium battery generates about two volts of electricity, the highest achieved yet with aluminium,'  but the researchers said the battery has only half the voltage of existing technology. And Google isn't the only tech giant working on such plans. Last month, Apple began recruiting for experts to help boost the battery across its range of mobiles and laptops. At least nine job listings were discovered by fan site AppleInsider and include listings for an iOS battery life software engineer, a software power systems engineer, battery pack engineering manager and a cell engineer. In particular, the iOS software power systems engineer role said the successful candidate 'will be working on design and development of software for triage of battery life issues, modeling of power consumed by different parts of the system, and analytics to understand large scale battery life trends.' Atmel also recently announced its latest microcontrollers (MCUs) that can be fitted to a variety of gadgets and are so low power they can harvest energy from a person's body. The  SAM L microcontrollers are part of Atmel's 32-bit ARM-based MCU range and are powered by chip maker ARM's Cortex M0+ 32-bit processors.

They use a third of the power of rival chips and tests have shown they are the lowest power microprocessor ever made. The microcontrollers run on the firm's picoPower technology and Atmel's Event System that makes different parts of the device work together to carry out tasks. By effectively 'sharing' energy, the whole device uses less power and, subsequently, less battery. It can also manage how much energy is being used by other components to make them as efficient as possible. Plus, the technology is so low power it can harvest energy from the body using changes in temperature. During a demonstration of the microcontrollers at this year's CES, Andreas Eieland, Atmel's director of product marketing demonstrated how he could power a radio by placing his hand on a panel. This panel recognised a change in temperature between the hand and the room and this was harvested to create charge .",Reports claim Google is latest firm to test alternative battery options .

"A gun trafficker for convicted killer Aaron Hernandez said he was 'awed' by the former New England Patriots star when he sent him an assault rifle and a pair of handguns a month before Odin Lloyd’s killing. Oscar 'Papoo' Hernandez Jr - no relation to the disgraced NFL player - has pleaded guilty to weapons charges in connection to his infamous namesake’s murder case. Earlier this month, Aaron Hernandez, 25, was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for first-degree murder of the semi-professional football player in 2013. Scroll down for video . Bad bro-mance: Oscar Hernandez Jr (left), 24, said he was 'awed' by New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez (right) and 'grateful to be noticed' when the football player paid him $15,000 for three guns . Unfortunate timing: Oscar Hernandez  shipped his namesake a rifle and two handguns in April 2013 - a month before the NFL player shot dead Odin Lloyd (pictured on screen in court) Hernandez had been a rising star in the NFL with a $41million contract when he was arrested in June of that year. In a sentencing memo in Oscar Hernandez’s weapons case released this week to Boston Herald the 24-year-old Florida man stated that he was blinded by the football player's fame ,'grateful to be noticed [by him], and had no way of anticipating the terrible events which would follow.' Although Oscar Hernandez was never called to testify against Aaron Hernandez during his trial earlier this month, his lawyer wrote in the memorandum to Judge William Young that his client was beaten by fellow inmates at the Wyatt Detention Center 'after having been incorrectly listed as a government witness.' Following the attack, Oscar Hernandez spent some time in solitary confinement at the Rhode Island jail. Mr Hernandez, a father from Belle Glen, Florida, is now facing up to 30 months in prison after pleading guilty in January to charges of transporting firearms across state lines; obstruction of justice; lying to a federal grand jury and witness tampering. Justice for Odin: The 25-year-old athlete (left) was found guilty April 15 of first-degree murder in the 2013 shooting death of the semi-professional football player (right) The confessed gun smuggler was scheduled to be sentenced Monday, but Judge Young has delayed the punishment phase until May 5. Public defender Charles McGinty, who represents Hernandez, is seeking a sentence of one year and one day for his client. Investigators said the Florida resident shipped three guns including FEG 7.62x39 Hungarian rifle, to Aaron Hernandez in the spring of 2013. The weapons had been stashed inside a beat-up Toyota Camry that was found in the football player's garage in North Attleboro, Massachusetts. A friend of Oscar Hernandez testified during the NFL star’s trial that the gun trafficker purchased the weapons April 16, 2013, five days after Aaron transferred $15,000 into his account. Oscar Hernandez was arrested April 17, 2014, and indicted by a grand jury in Massachusetts on gun trafficking charges. Back behind bars: Following the sentencing phase, Hernandez was handcuffed and returned to jail. He has since been transferred to a maximum-security facility . The indictment stated that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives had traced three guns that had been recovered during the investigation of Odin Lloyd's killing. The ATF determined that all three guns were purchased in Florida in April 2013. Massachusetts officials said they have been unable to find the gun used to kill Lloyd, which they've identified as a .45-caliber Glock. None of the three guns mentioned in Oscar Hernandez's indictment is a .45-caliber Glock. Meanwhile, his notorious namesake was transferred last week to the maximum security state Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center in Shirley to begin serving his life sentence. Aaron Hernandez is also awaiting a trial date for the 2012 homicides of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado.","Oscar Hernandez Jr has pleaded guilty to transporting firearms, obstruction of justice, lying to a federal grand jury and witness tampering .

"Visitors to a metro-Detroit museum have a chance to get an up-close look at the chair Abraham Lincoln was shot in at Washington D.C.'s Ford's Theatre in 1865 next week as the museum puts it center stage. The red, worn chair will be removed from its enclosure at Dearborn's Henry Ford Museum and displayed in an open plaza on April 15 as part of the museum's observance of the assassination's 150 anniversary. Two days earlier, it will be onstage when renowned historian and Lincoln expert Doris Kearns Goodwin delivers a sold-out lecture at The Henry Ford. The chair in which Abraham Lincoln was shot has been on display at The Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan, for 85 years. On April 15, it will be removed from its encasing to be displayed for the 150th anniversary of the assassination . Abraham Lincoln (left) was shot in Ford's Theatre in Washington D.C. on April 14, 1865 by pro-Confederacy actor, John Wilkes Booth (right). Lincoln died from his injuries the next day . The chair has a dark stain on the back, which many visitors believe to be blood from the shooting. But historians at the museum say that the stain is oil from other people's heads who sat in the chair before Lincoln . Lincoln's chair has been part of the museum started by pioneering automaker Henry Ford - no relation to the theater-owning Ford family - since its founding 85 years ago. The government removed it from the theater and held it as evidence, and it ended up at the Smithsonian Institution. The wife of a theater co-owner petitioned to reclaim it, then sold it at auction to an agent working for Henry Ford. Henry Ford also bought the Logan County Courthouse where Lincoln practiced law in Illinois in the 1840s and moved it to the outdoor area next to his museum known as Greenfield Village. For decades, the theater chair was housed in that courthouse. Around 1980, the chair was placed inside the museum, where it's now part of the 'With Liberty and Justice for All' exhibit. 'Lincoln was one of Henry Ford's heroes - when he decided he wanted to have this village, he wanted to collect Lincoln stuff as an educational tool,' said curator Donna Braden. 'The courthouse is pretty much the first thing Henry Ford acquired related to Lincoln and the chair came soon after.' A playbill from Our American Cousin from the night President Abraham Lincoln was assassinated on April 14, 1865 is shown on display at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn . A copy of a hand colored 1870 lithographic print by Gibson & Co. provided by the U.S. Library of Congress shows John Wilkes Booth shooting U.S. President Abraham Lincoln as he sits in the presidential box at Ford's Theatre . A copy of a 1865 lithographic print by Currier & Ives provided by the U.S. Library of Congress shows the same event from a different angle . Many visitors wonder whether dark spots on the back of the chair are Lincoln's blood. Not so, say museum workers: The stains are oil from other people's heads who sat in the chair before that fateful night when Lincoln was shot by a pro-Confederacy actor, John Wilkes Booth. Steve Harris, a historic presenter at the museum, tells passers-by that Lincoln's head would have been positioned much higher than the stain because he was 6ft, 4in tall. Taking in objects from the final hours of two important American lives is a major draw to the museum. The Henry Ford also owns the limousine President John F. Kennedy was riding in when he was fatally shot in Dallas nearly a century later. Museum officials say the chair and car are among the most visited artifacts in the museum, along with the bus Rosa Parks rode in when she refused to give up her seat to a white rider and helped spark the civil rights movement. Ford's Theatre in Washington D.C. has arranged the presidential box identically to the way it was the night Lincoln was shot through the doorway . Abraham Lincoln's iconic silk top hat, which he was wearing the night he was assassinated, is part of the museum display at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C. Goodwin, author of 'Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln,' told The Associated Press that the chair will offer an extra 'dimension' to her words and the experience of those in the room. 'There's an intimacy to it that catapults you back in time,' she said. 'And hopefully, along with that, you're not just thinking of the death but the life that made it worthwhile.' Museum visitor Jeff Buczkiewicz stood before the chair, peered silently into the glass-enclosed case at the rocking chair, then snapped pictures for posterity . 'You just get drawn into these things,' said Buczkiewicz, 47, who came from suburban Chicago with his family to the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan. 'It is a tragic part of our history and our country. I think it's important to take it all in.' Milestone anniversaries seem to add to the impact of objects like the chair and limo. About 8,000 people visited the limo on November 22, 2013, a free-admission day marking the 50th anniversary of JFK's assassination, so the chair is likely to draw plenty of visitors on the Lincoln anniversary, which also has free admission. The single-shot Deringer pistol John Wilkes Booth used to kill Abraham Lincoln is displayed at the Center for Education and Leadership at Ford's Theatre in Washington . 'It really is about the power of the artifact,' said Patricia Mooradian, president of The Henry Ford, as the entire history attraction is known. 'It's less about the artifact itself than the symbolic nature of the artifact that represents a great paradigm change in the history of our country,' she added. Buskiewicz has also visited Dealey Plaza in Dallas where Kennedy was assassinated. 'You just have to try to take it in when you're in those areas,' he said, but he wonders 'why we gravitate' toward places and things associated with these types of events. Goodwin, whose book helped inspire Steven Spielberg's movie, 'Lincoln,' says that standing before iconic yet everyday objects provides a deep experience that transcends the moment that made them famous. 'In some ways, it's more familiar when it's a chair, a bus or a limo,' she said. 'There's something about the tangibility of these things.' The chair in which Lincoln was show is regularly displayed in an encasing at The Henry Ford Museum. For the 150th anniversary it will be taken out of the encasing .","The Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan, has had chair for 85 years . The worn, red chair, from Washington D.C.'s Ford's Theatre, is usually kept in an enclosed case but will be put in an open plaza on April 15 .

"Tottenham are considering a state-of-the-art stadium with a retractable pitch that enables them to become the home of a new NFL London franchise. The bold design of the new £400million stadium, due to be completed for the start of the 2018-19 season, could involve a ‘slide-out’ grass football pitch with an NFL-style synthetic surface housed underneath. The option of extra-large changing rooms, to accommodate NFL squad sizes that can amount to as many as 70 players at a game, is also being explored by architects. Tottenham are considering sharing their new £400m stadium with an NFL franchise . A spokesman for the north London club did not rule out the possibility this week, confirming that they are ‘looking at options’ in order to ‘future-proof the design’. The NFL is said to be within five years of having a permanent franchise in London. Indeed officials will be testing logistics when they stage their three games at Wembley this autumn, with teams looking at how quickly they can have their players back in the USA and ready to play again. The clash between the Buffalo Bills and Jacksonville Jaguars on October 25 will kick-off at 1.30pm while the New York Jets vs Miami Dolphins game on October 4 and Detroit Lions vs Kansas City Chiefs contest on November 1 will both begin at 2.30pm. As well as allowing the NFL to experiment with a live game on TV at breakfast time in the States (9.30am Eastern time), teams are able to take advantage of the time difference and be home on American soil by Sunday night. Tottenham's new state-of-the-art stadium is due to be ready in time for the 2018-19 season . Spurs' new 65,000 capacity stadium could be better suited to the NFL than the 90,000-seat Wembley . If Tottenham press ahead with the proposed stadium design and secure the NFL franchise it would represent a significant blow to the FA, who also see the NFL as a potentially lucrative partner for Wembley, their £757m stadium. But the NFL are keeping their options open at this stage in the knowledge that a new London stadium designed with American football requirements in mind would be hugely advantageous. Even the proposed capacity of 65,000 for the new White Hart Lane is a more realistic target than 90,000 seats which Wembley boasts. Wembley does have the iconic status that the NFL finds attractive but there are other issues with the national stadium. Not least the fact that they have to leave the lowest 5,000 seats empty so that the view of spectators is not restricted by the mass of huge bodies on the touchline. The modern NFL stadiums make sight-lines for spectators a priority and the new White Hart Lane could overcome the problem that is experienced at Wembley by having the artificial pitch at a significantly lower level beneath the moveable grass pitch. Wembley has hosted NFL regular-season matches since the International Series began in 2007 . Detroit Lions' clash with Atlanta Falcons kicked off early, as will all three games at Wembley later this year . Retractable grass pitches are nothing new in modern stadia design. England have played on two: at Gelsenkirchen in Germany during the 2006 World Cup and in the Sapporo Dome in Japan four years earlier. The Gelredome in Holland also has a retractable pitch, as does the University of Phoenix Stadium that hosted this year’s Super Bowl. The advantage for these stadiums is the ability to grow the grass in a more natural environment, outside, away from the shadows of the stands while also having the capacity to stage different events without damaging the playing surface. A feat of modern engineering, a pitch can be moved outside the stadium in less than four hours. A spokesman for Tottenham said: ‘The club has always seen the new stadium as being at the heart of the regeneration of the area and it is important, therefore, to look at how we future-proof the design, as well as increasing the functionality of the stadium, whilst being conscious of community uses. At this stage it is about looking at options but nothing more.’",Tottenham's new £400m stadium due to be completed for 2018-19 season .

'Badgers can squeeze through any gaps in fences or hedges which are bigger than 7.5 centimetres. So if you have fencing with the slats spaced more narrowly, that will help. 'Even better, people can protect their property through badger-proof fencing. This goes a foot or two into the ground so that badgers cannot tunnel underneath it.

One road, forever pot-holed in the past decade, is now being covered over by Afghans who, it seems, are finally reclaiming that street. Even Chicken Street, the hackneyed pedestrian shopping road where new Western arrivals would buy carpets or local trinkets, is more or less deserted. One shopkeeper says it could be the embassy security warnings that are keeping people away now. It is the same for the restaurants here that used to brim with contractors and NGO workers. They are now empty, the sound of their heavy metal doors echoing across deserted tables. It is immeasurably different to three years ago when I lived there. Drive out east -- past the women in burqas who sit on road bumps, holding their children, hoping drivers will slow enough to throw them change -- and you see roads lined with the detritus of America's war here. Huge lines of excavators, cherry-pickers, and forklift trucks sit idle. At times it seemed there was little America wouldn't do, or try, to meets its often fluid goals in the country. Yet today, the machines that could have once moved small mountains do little more than gather dust. EXCLUSIVE: Afghan woman forced to marry her rapist . Further down the road too are more winners-turned-losers of the NATO presence here. Vast supply chains once kept 120,000 troops fed and watered. Trucks lined the roads and climbed up to the military bases. Now the bases are gone, and the trucks that once supplied millions sit still. Their bosses may have fled abroad with their winnings, yet the drivers have been left behind, stuck with vehicles that cost them $30,000 to buy -- and $1,000 a year just to keep on the road -- but that would fetch just a tenth of that price now. ""The contracts were with big businessmen and commanders who were giving us very little and made themselves very rich and are now living comfortably in Dubai,"" one truck driver tells us. Yet still the wedding palaces proliferate. Along one stretch of road their endless, multiplying lights throb. Each night the houses seem packed -- the commitment to the future still is popular here, despite the uncertainty -- even if the lights that decorate them seem more and more like a symbol of leaving. One set actually replicates the shape of an expensive hotel in Dubai. The city's lights do shine staggeringly and often constantly -- something the Taliban never achieved during their rule here. NATO's efforts to keep them on are reported to have involved diesel power stations that cost billions but were barely switched on. The question many surely ask here -- as the last American troops prepare to retreat inside the U.S. Embassy by the end of next year -- is how much longer the lights will continue to glow.

"A chef has created a 10in-tall, half-kilogram burger piled with six forms of three different meats and containing a whopping 2,000 calories. The Whole Damn Farm, which costs £13.50, is the creation of Sam Longhurst, head chef of Splendid Kitchen, Manchester. He devised the mega meal - which contains two beef patties and a whole fried chicken thigh - after he was challenged by diners to create a burger containing three kinds of meat. The Whole Damn Farm burger features two beef burgers, homemade bacon jam, ham chunks, a whole chicken thigh, barbequed pulled pork and bacon rashers . Ready, get set, go! Customer Angela Fox gets ready to take on the mighty meat challenge . The monstrous meat feast has two beef burgers weighing 220g, a layer of homemade bacon jam, 100g of ham chunks and a 150g whole battered and fried chicken thigh. Added to that is 80g of barbequed pulled pork and four rashers of bacon all sandwiched between two brioche buns. With a meat equivalent of six Big Macs the burger was created after a customer presented with the restaurant's 'Cow & Chicken' burger - a feast in its own right - remarked, 'It's almost the whole damn farm.' Mr Longhurst said: 'We are always up for a challenge and when a customer seemed disappointed by a burger that only contained beef and chicken, we knew we had to take it one step further. 'You could say we've taken it several steps further as there are six different forms of meat on there. I think it'll keep the punters satisfied.' The head chef joined forces with owner Mike Edge to set out to achieve what might constitute a whole farmyard of animals in one meal. Chef Sam Longhurst from the Splendid Kitchen restaurant in Manchester with his mega burger . Encased between a semi-brioche bun are: . Two beef burgers weighing 220g .

Mr Longhurst, who lives in Salford with his wife and eight-year-old son Matthew, said: 'It's amusing when people are cocky and decide to go for it, as it's a monster of a burger and they don't realise that. I have only just managed to eat it myself. 'It's loads of fun making stuff that's a little bit ridiculous. I experiment with cooking at home too. 'Matthew and I will make homemade burgers stuffed with cheese and cold meats, so I think of The Whole Damn Farm burger as a supersized version of that. 'I think Matthew would be scared of it, to be honest, a burger the same size as his head.' Mr Edge said: 'We wanted something show-stopping; we haven't gone down the road of using crisps and sweets as toppings, where it starts to get silly. 'All our dishes are quite fresh-tasting with just the odd strange ingredient.'","Chef Sam Longhurst of Splendid Kitchen Manchester created the burger .

"(CNN)Hillary Clinton's campaign-in-waiting met on Saturday in its Brooklyn headquarters, a day before the former secretary of state officially announces her campaign for president, according to a Democrat who attended the meeting. Robby Mook, Clinton's soon-to-be campaign manager, distributed a ""values statement"" at the meeting that outlined what the campaign will stand for, what their goals are and how they plan to win -- something Clinton failed to do in 2008. The campaign's purpose, the document states, is ""to give every family, every small business, and every American a path to lasting prosperity by electing Hillary Clinton the next President of the United States."" The document makes clear that the campaign will try to avoid mistakes that plagued Clinton's failed 2008 run. Many of the ""guiding principles"" in the memo mention issues that sunk Clinton's first campaign. The document, according to the source, includes the ideas from Mook, along with a wide array of Clinton's soon-to-be staffers and advisers. The memo maintains that the campaign must remain humble, disciplined and united, something voters in Iowa and others states have said Clinton did not do in 2008. ""This campaign is not about Hillary Clinton and not about us,"" reads the document that was obtained by CNN. In the section about the campaign's guiding principles, the document reads, ""We are humble: We take nothing for granted, we are never afraid to lose, we always outcompete and fight for every vote we can win. We know this campaign will be won on the ground, in states."" It also calls on campaign staffers to remain ""disciplined"" and ""open to a diverse range of views."" ""When we disagree, it's never personal. Once a decision is made, we execute it -- together,"" reads the memo. ""We know there will be tough days, but we will bounce back and get back to work."" The document also appears to telegraph the name to Clinton's campaign: ""Hillary for America."" Clinton is planning to launch her presidential candidacy on Sunday through a video message on social media, according to Democratic sources. Shortly after her announcement, Clinton will travel Iowa and New Hampshire, critical early caucus primary and caucus states.","Robby Mook, Hillary Clinton's soon-to-be campaign manager, distributes a ""values statement"" The memo maintains that the campaign must remain humble, disciplined and united .",1699cfcf49de1f7b02ea39e985a005afa835e957
"(CNN)Civil unions between people of the same sex will soon be recognized in Chile. The country joined several of its South American neighbors in allowing the unions when President Michelle Bachelet enacted a new law on Monday. ""This is a concrete step in the drive to end the difference between homosexual and heterosexual couples,"" Bachelet said. The new law will take effect in six months. It will give legal weight to cohabiting relationships between two people of the same sex and between a man and a woman. The Chilean government estimates that around 2 million people will be able to benefit from the change. The law is intended to end discrimination faced by common-law couples, such as not being allowed to visit partners in hospital, make medical decisions on their behalf or decide what to do with their remains. It also gives the couples greater rights in the realms of property, health care, pensions and inheritance. A number of South American nations have moved to allow same-sex civil unions in recent years.

"A device has been created that can scan entire planes for contraband, bombs and weapons. The mobile X-ray scanner, heralded as the world’s first ‘airplane scanner’, sweeps down a plane and can detect various objects inside. While the radiation emitted by the scanner is not safe yet for humans to be in the plane when it is operated, the company behind it thinks it could become a vital tool in aircraft safety. Scroll down for video . Romanian company MB Telecom has revealed the Roboscan 2M Aeria. It uses a cone of radiation to sweep across planes (shown) and look inside. The device is accurate enough to find a filament in a light bulb. But the radiation it emits is not safe for passengers yet . The Roboscan 2M Aeria is being developed by Romanian company MB Telecom (MBT). It costs €3 million (£2.1 million, $3.2 million), reported The Times, and is apparently already being used to check trucks at borders in Eastern Europe, where it has helped seize 76,000 packs of illegal cigarettes. On its website, MBT says the Aeria is ‘the very first solution for aircraft security inspection.’ It can scan planes from small private jets to medium-sized commercial airplanes. The company notes that, while passengers and their luggage are thoroughly inspected at airports, there is no such inspection process for jets arriving at small private airports with low security. But with their device, the company says this ‘gap’ in aviation security can be plugged, and it can scan an entire plane in about 20 minutes. The device can be used to detect weapons (shown) and other contraband in small or medium-sized jets that land at low-security airports . An operator working inside the truck can look inside the entirety of a plane, although currently under regulations some areas of the plane - such as the fuselage and wings - are restricted . There are four main components that allow an aircraft to be scanned. Armed with a sharp sense of smell, dogs have a long history of detecting explosives for their human handlers, and soon there could be sniffer elephants too. Researchers have found that the large mammals excel at identifying explosives by smell, stirring speculation about whether their extraordinary ability could save lives. Elephants could be used to detect land mines in areas that have seen conflict and could even do so at a distance with the aid of drones. The research was conducted in South Africa and involved the U.S. military. The first is the operating truck, from which an operator can use the system and look inside the plane. Attached to this is a robotic arm with an X-ray generator at the end. The plane is then pulled forwards by a battery-operated tug over a wide detection module. By firing X-rays out of the arm, a cone of radiation sweeps over the plane. The operator inside the truck is then given live images of the interior of the plane, and is able to scan its entirety for hidden items. It is apparently so accurate that it could pick out keys on a seat or even a filament in a light bulb. One issue, though, is that aircraft operators do not authorities to inspect the whole plane - areas of the fuselage and the wings are off limits, even though Roboscan can examine these areas. ‘You cannot touch it, but you can scan it,’ said Radu Tudor of MBT at the Counter Terror Expo in London this week.

"The Ministry of Defence was under fire after vital details of the RAF's main base on the Falklands Islands were published on their website. The secret document, which has the exact GPS co-ordinates of vital facilities as well as information on the depth of concrete on the runway were published unencrypted on the MoD's website. The details could be used as 'an invasion guide' by Argentina, with the technical information providing excellent intelligence to any Argentine bombers sent to attack the islands. The Falklands Islands are defended by a squadron of RAF Typhoon aircraft operating from Mount Pleasant aerodrome on West Falkland, supported by a refueling tanker to extend their operational area . The aerodrome also operates as a Search and Rescue location with Sea King helicopters, pictured . The airstrip, pictured, is home to four Europfighter Typhoon aircraft tasked with defending the islands . The Aerodrome Manual was accidentally uploaded onto a public section of the MoD's website and could have been downloaded by Argentine intelligence agents to help prepare a mission to recapture the islands. A senior military source told The Express: 'This is exactly the kind of intel foreign powers send spies to get. 'It's practically an invasion handbook. Taking out the runway could cripple Britain's ability to fight off invaders in the ongoing sovereignty dispute.' The MoD admitted the manual had been available on the internet but the link had been disabled. They denied the information was particularly sensitive. The blunder occurred as Argentina was described as a 'very live threat' by Defence Secretary Michael Fallon. This comes as Argentina is preparing to lease 12 Sukhoi SU-24 long-range bombers from Russia. The Falklands Islands are defended by modern Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft, supported by Rapier surface-to-air missiles and 1,200 troops. The Royal Navy also patrols the area and nuclear-powered submarines are also thought regularly travel to the region. And the MoD recently announced the £228million purchase of new anti-aircraft missiles to boost island defences. The jets are housed in hangers just off the main runway where they can be airborne quickly to intercept any potential aircraft inbound from Argentina in the event of a new conflict . Argentina is considering leasing 12 Suhkoi SU-24 bombers, pictured, from Russia. The Cold War-era jets have a range of 650 miles and would be able to bomb Mount Pleasant without the need to refuel . The MoD published the Aerodrome Manual on their website where it could be downloaded by anyone . The Cold War-era jet has a maximum range of 650 miles - which means it could attack the Falklands Islands and return to Argentina without the need to refuel. It also can carry 3,000kg of bombs as well as air-to-air missiles. The jets, despite being designed in the 1960s, are also capable of supersonic travel. This comes as tensions between Britain and Argentina have increased over plans by UK firms to drill for oil in the South Atlantic. Argentina's minister for the Malivinas - the name it uses for the Falklands Islands - Daniel Filmus threatened to prosecute any British firms exploring for oil near the islands. He said: 'The new exploration efforts to try to find hydrocarbons in the area carry a huge environmental risk. 'We want the owners of the companies to be tried according to Argentine laws and international statutes.' A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We have always been very clear that this is an unlawful assertion of jurisdiction over the Falklands Islands' continental shelf, which we reject, and we will raise it will the appropriate authorities. 'We are satisfied that the Islands have the right to develop their hydrocarbons sector as a legitimate commercial venture with international oil and gas companies, and will continue to support them as they move forward. Argentine domestic law does not apply to the Falkland Islands.'","The MoD accidentally published information on Falklands RAF base online .

"(CNN)Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin signed a bill on Friday that would allow the state to perform executions with nitrogen gas if lethal injection is ruled unconstitutional or becomes unavailable. Nitrogen causes a quick loss of consciousness and then death from lack of oxygen, Fallin's office said in a press release. CNN affiliate KFOR says it's never been used in an execution in the United States. ""The person will become unconscious within eight to 10 seconds and death a few minutes later. In other words, a humane, quick and painless death,"" said Rep. Mike Christian, one of the bill's authors, according to KFOR. Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, told the Washington Post that the same ""painless"" argument had been used to advance the use of lethal injections. ""The hasty manner in which this bill sped into law reflects the same lack of care with which Oklahoma has managed its execution process historically,"" he said. Oklahoma's executions have been put on hold while the U.S. Supreme Court reviews its use of lethal injections. Last year, the state came under scrutiny when it took 43 minutes to kill convicted killer Clayton Lockett. Fallin reaffirmed her support for the death penalty. ""Oklahoma executes murderers whose crimes are especially heinous,"" Fallin said. ""I support that policy, and I believe capital punishment must be performed effectively and without cruelty. The bill I signed today gives the state of Oklahoma another death penalty option that meets that standard."" The governor's office said the first alternative for execution is lethal injection, followed by nitrogen gas, the electric chair and the firing squad.","Nitrogen gas causes a quick loss of consciousness and then death from lack of oxygen, Oklahoma says .

"Attack: Sam Barton, who has had £55,000 of cosmetic surgery to look like Joey Essex, was egged on Easter Monday (pictured) 'Britain's vainest man' who had taxpayer-funded plastic surgery  to look like reality star Joey Essex said today he is being bullied online by a gang who have now  thrown eggs in his face. Sam Barton, who has had £55,000 of cosmetic surgery  - including two operations on the NHS - believes the culprits tracked him down using his Facebook posts and then attacked him in the street. The 22-year-old says abuse online about his appearance also forced him to move house. On Easter Monday he was attacked by a group of men who pelted him with eggs from a car. Sam had been enjoying a drink in the Green House pub in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, when a group of men shouted abuse at him as he left. The yobs then hurled six eggs at him before speeding off - leaving him with yolk and shell running down his face on the pavement. Sam said he believed he had been targeted because he had 'checked in' at the pub on Facebook minutes earlier. He said: 'It was quite a shock at first. I had just left the pub with two friends when I was suddenly pelted in eggs. 'There was shell in my hair and yolk dripping down my face. 'They shouted my name and swore at me as they drove past and threw eggs at me. 'They clearly didn't like me. It was not the kind of egg I was hoping to receive over the Easter holiday but after the shock had worn off I did have a laugh about it.' Scroll down for video . Sam had been taking part in filming with Geordie Shore star Vicky Pattison on Saturday April 4 - just two days before he was attacked. Spending: Barton has spent £20,000 on treatment for his teeth, around £5,000 on Botox, £2,000 on waxing and £2,500 on tanning treatment.

Debts: Barton admits he had debts of £100,000 on 15 credit cards and store cards trying to make it as a celeb . He also recently appeared on popular ITV show Judge Rinder to resolve a wrangle with a lapdancer friend over a Botox treatment row. Sam, who has spent £55,000 on perfecting his look, revealed in January he was going bankrupt after racking up debts of £35,000 on his Champagne lifestyle. Sam is the grandson of Aston Villa's European Cup winning boss Tony Barton and is best friends with Benefits Street star White Dee. Fame-hungry Sam previously revealed he had spent £55,000 on reconstructive surgery and beauty treatments to turn himself into the 'perfect man.' And he has amassed credit card debts of £25,000 in four years in search of the Joey Essex look that he hopes will make him a star. He has spent £20,000 on treatment for his teeth, around £5,000 on Botox, £2,000 on waxing and £2,500 on tanning treatment. Two nose jobs have cost £10,400, although one was free on the NHS. He admitted spending an astonishing £100,000 in just four years, blowing up to £2,000 a night on £300 bottles of expensive fizz. Sam, who lives with mum Jackie, dad Chris and brother Ed in Sutton Coldfield, plunged into the red after spending a fortune on plastic surgery. He added: 'I've spent around £55,000 trying to improve my looks and get the perfect image. 'The rest I've spent on designer clothes, jewellery, holidays, spa treatment and champagne. 'In total, I have spent around £100,000. At one point I counted 15 credit cards and store cards. 'I really do not regret it, I have had the time of my life over the last few years. 'My manager says this bankruptcy thing will clear my debts, so it's basically free money isn't it?'

"David Cameron will launch a multi-billion pound sale of Lloyds Bank shares if he wins the Election – in what would be the largest privatisation bonanza since the Thatcher era. The Prime Minister will today pledge that if he is returned to Downing Street he will offer the public £4 billion of Lloyds shares still held by the Government after Gordon Brown’s £20 billion panic bailout with taxpayers’ money during the 2008 economic crisis. Individuals will be allowed to buy up to £10,000 worth of Lloyds Banking Group shares, which were worth 78.7p when the stock market closed on Friday – comfortably above the 73.6p paid by Mr Brown’s government. Scroll down for video . David Cameron will launch a multi-billion pound sale of Lloyds Bank shares if he wins the Election . The shares will be offered at a discount of at least 5 per cent on the market rate at the time, with the proceeds used to help pay down the national debt. It is the latest ‘retro’ Conservative policy to hark back to the 1980s, following Mr Cameron’s revival in the manifesto of the Thatcherite ‘Right to Buy’ offer for housing association tenants. But while investors 30 years ago took overnight profits on their stakes in privatised companies such as British Gas and British Telecom – leading critics to claim that it encouraged ‘carpetbaggers’ – Lloyds shareholders will be encouraged to hang on to their holding. A loyalty bonus will be offered of one free share for every ten held for at least a year after the sale, up to a maximum bonus value of £200. The sale of Lloyds shares would be the biggest privatisation since the 1980s when Mrs Thatcher’s government sold £3.9 billion of BT shares and £5.6 billion of British Gas shares in the famous ‘Tell Sid’ campaign. Thirty-three major companies were privatised under Mrs Thatcher between 1984 and 1991, which supporters said led to a dramatic improvement in their efficiency and a boost to tax revenues for the Treasury. Like Right to Buy, it also helped to entrench Tory support among voters who benefited from the windfalls. No 10 strategists hope Mr Cameron’s pledge will remind voters of the economic problems that blighted the country under Mr Brown’s premiership. The recovery under Chancellor George Osborne has allowed him to sell £9 billion of shares in Lloyds to City investors for more than the price that former chancellor Alistair Darling paid in 2008. CLAIM: Jesse Norman and the chocolate cake he allegedly gave out while campaigning for re-election . Police are investigating a Tory MP over claims he attempted to bribe voters with chocolate cake. Jesse Norman allegedly gave out cake while campaigning for re-election at an Asda supermarket in his Hereford constituency. West Mercia Police last night said it was investigating reports of a breach of the Representation of the People Act 1983, which bans Election candidates from providing food, drink or entertainment in a bid to win votes. The probe follows would-be Ukip MP Kim Rose, who is standing in Southampton Itchen, being grilled by police for giving out sausage rolls at a party event earlier this year. Detectives are expected to speak to Mr Norman after he was photographed with trays of baked goods on April 2. He described the allegations as ‘nonsense’, saying: ‘We had a couple of small boxes of chocolate muffins ... we may have given out one or two to children, who are not even voters.’ There have been two sales to big pension funds and City institutions in 2013 and early in 2014. Late last year, UK Financial Investments, the Treasury body that manages the Government stake, hired investment bank Morgan Stanley to sell a few million Lloyds shares in the market every day over a six month period – a practice known as a ‘dribble-out’. The Government still owns £12.5 billion of Lloyds shares and experts expect £4 billion worth to be offered to the public, with the rest sold to City institutions. With the share price currently above 78p, the Tories will be able claim they have banked a profit running into billions for the taxpayer. However, while Lloyds has been a success story, the Government’s other big bank investment – Royal Bank of Scotland – has not. The Treasury under Mr Brown paid an average of 502p a share for RBS when it was rescued. They were changing hands on Friday for 349p. In Mr Cameron’s announcement today, he is expected to say: ‘The £20 billion bailout of Lloyds Bank by the last Labour government became a symbol of the crisis that engulfed the British economy under Labour. After the public bailed it out, people feared they wouldn’t see their money returned. Today they are. ‘Today’s announcement marks another step in the long journey we have been making repairing our banks, turning our economy around and reducing our national debt, only made possible by our long-term economic plan. ‘That’s why it is so important that we don’t put all that progress at risk, but instead build on what we’ve done so we can deliver a brighter, more secure future for our country.’ COUNTRY LIFE: A 'beater' at work and below,  a bottle of Sipsmith Dry Gin . The Prime Minister indulged his love of country sports by taking part in a secret country shoot near his Oxfordshire constituency home. And he celebrated with a nip of a specially prepared ‘Chipping Norton’ cocktail. But witnesses say that David Cameron did not himself use a gun – despite his reputation as a skilled marksman. Instead, he acted as a ‘beater’ to flush out the game. The event took place on New Year’s Eve but until now has been kept a closely guarded secret. It took place near Chipping Norton, the Oxfordshire town which has given its name to the ‘Chipping Norton set’ of high-profile local residents from the world of politics, media and showbusiness such as Mr Cameron and Jeremy Clarkson. Last night, the man who served Mr Cameron the cocktail said other people on what he described as a ‘country walk’ had no idea there would be a VIP guest. Jared Brown, master distiller at the West London ‘artisanal’ gin company Sipsmith, said: ‘No one but the landowner knew the Prime Minister would be joining us.’ He fought shy of describing the event as a shoot, but added: ‘I can say with utter certainty that Mr Cameron did not handle a gun.’ Mr Brown confirmed, though, that the PM did sample the cocktail, based on Sipsmith London Dry Gin. Last night, the drink, also containing manuka honey, raspberry tea and extract of echinacea, was being dubbed the ‘Chipping Norton cocktail’.",David Cameron will pledge to sell Lloyds shares if he wins the election .

"The son of a Syrian imam who was shot dead on a London street may have met his father’s killer just days before the murder. Sources close to the investigation, which is being led by the counter-terrorism unit, told the Sunday Times that Abdul Hadi Arwani, an opponent of Syrian President Bahsar Al-Assad, had visited the area where he was killed with his son days before his death. Arwani, 48, was shot and killed in his car on a quiet street in North West London after being called there last Tuesday, apparently to provide a quote for building work. Scroll down for video . imam, Abdul Hadi Arwani (pictured), was called to a job in the area he was killed days before his death . When the imam, who had links to the Muslim Brotherhood in the UK and abroad, arrived to the house with his son and not on his own, the supposed potential client asked Arwani to come back another day. The man was identified as black and speaking with an African accent. He pretended to have lost his keys which is why he asked Arwani, a part-time builder, to return later. The Sunday Telegraph reported that the man, who has not been otherwise been identified, also told the imam that there was no need for his son to accompany him again when he did come back. Arwani's children are in little doubt their father was killed by the man asking for the building quote. Scotland Yard is looking into whether the man was a hired killer who postponed the hit because because Arwani was not alone. The counter-terrorism unit has special expertise relating to politically motivated assassinations but they are also keeping other lines of inquiry open. Aspects of Arwani’s personal life as well as his financial standing are being considered. The Syrian-born activist and imam died of multiple gunshot wounds to the chest sustained near to the junction of the Paddocks and Greenhill, Wembley. His car was parked on what has been described as a blind bend, just out of sight of CCTV. Home: Mr Arwani, originally from Syria, lived in this home in White City, west London . Arwani’s VW Passat was parked neatly on the side of the road with its engine still running and one window wound down when his body was found . Neighbours, nearby at the time of the murder, have said they did not hear any shots fired, indicating, perhaps, that the killer used a silencer. Arwani’s VW Passat was parked neatly on the side of the road with its engine still running and one window wound down when his body was found. The Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist political group to which Arwani had long-standing links, is outlawed in many Middle Eastern countries. One Syrian opposition activist has said despite Arwami’s standing and his participation in protests against the Assad regime in London in 2012 (pictured) the imam was an unlikely target for assassination . One of the imam’s friends was quoted as saying that Arwani left the group in an official capacity ‘seven or eight years ago’ but had kept ties with some of the group’s senior figures. One Muslim Brotherhood leader, Ali Sadraddine Al-Bayanouni attended a gathering in remembrance of Arwani in the capital last week. Described as ‘non-violent Islamist’ by his family Arwani had links to a number of controversial preachers. Among them was Abu Qatada, deported to Jordan and dubbed Osama Bin Laden’s man in Europe. Arwani also campaigned against the extradition of the hook-welding preacher Abu Hamzr for offences related to terrorism. Despite the connections there is nothing to suggest Arwani was anything more than a peaceful moderate. Leaving Syria in 1982 during the last, failed uprising against the Assad regime, Arwami moved to Britain in the mid 1990s. He studied Islamic Sharia in Jordan where he claimed to have been sentenced to death in his absence by Syrian authorities. One Syrian opposition activist has said despite Arwani’s standing and his participation in protests against the Assad regime in London in 2012 the imam was an unlikely target for assassination. Imam: Mr Arwani was a preacher at the An-Noor Mosque (pictured) in Acton, West London, which has a reputation for hosting fundamentalist speakers . Hassan Anywabwile (pictured) from Trinidad and Tobago was brought in to replace Arwani at the An-Noor Mosque . Bassam Tablieh, a solicitor and opponent of the Syrian government, said there were many more obvious, high priority targets for Syrian authorities to go after in London. Police are also looking into a row over finances and transparency which led to Arwani being ousted from the An-Noor mosque in Acton where he was imam up until 2011. He was replaced at his mosque by a Caribbean preacher involved in an attempted coup d'état 25 years ago. Hassan Anywabwile from Trinidad and Tobago was brought in to replace Arwani at the An-Noor Mosque. Anywabwile's name appears in the Caribbean nation's parliamentary documents surrounding a violent coup attempt in 1990 by Muslim group Jamaat al Muslimeen It is understood that Arwani wanted to register the mosque as a charity with trustees, moving it away from its current status whereby the Acton mosque operates as a company. While the building for the mosque was bought for £1 million, raised in contributions from a number of members of the community, land registry records state the sole owner to be Khalid Rashad, one of the mosque’s founders, through a firm called ‘Brickridge’. The murdered imam had reportedly begun legal proceedings in the high court over the dispute. Rashad, 61, a Muslim convert from Wembley refused to comment on the row or Arwani’s decision to leave the mosque. He referred to a statement that expressed ‘great sadness’ at the imam’s death. It has not been suggested that any members of the mosque were involved in the murder.","Imam Abdul Hadi Arwani called to a building job in the area he was killed .

"John Carver knows only too well that a Tyne-Wear derby can make or break a manager. His first in the dugout was as assistant to Ruud Gullit in August, 1999, when on a sodden night at St James' Park the Dutchman left out Alan Shearer and Duncan Ferguson and paid for his selection with his job after a 2-1 defeat. Carver is now fighting to win the head coach position beyond the end of this season and knows what impact a victory – or a loss – could have on Sunday afternoon. John Carver is relishing the chance to take charge of his hometown club against Sunderland on Sunday . Gullit controversially decided not to start star players Duncan Ferguson and Alan Shearer in 1999 . Carver was assistant to former Newcastle manager Ruud Gullit who managed the club between 1998 and 1999 . His memories of Gullit's downfall remind him of such consequences. 'We were at the old training ground at Durham Cricket Club and I was in the room with Steve Clarke and Ruud,' recalls Carver. 'All of a sudden, he started talking about what the team was going to be against Sunderland. I said, 'Sorry Ruud, what did you say there?'. 'He said he was going to leave out Alan and Duncan. I said, 'Do you know how important this game is?'. 'He said, 'I have played in some massive derbies. I've played in them in Holland and London and I played in the Milan derby too'. 'I said, 'Yeah, but you haven't played in one like this Ruud'. 'And then we just walked out of the room. He seemed set on the fact that was what he was going to do. 'I talked about it being a motivation for the opposition seeing Alan and Duncan on the bench. But he had no concerns whatsoever. 'I actually thought, 'If we don't win it, he's gone'. I said to Steve, 'Is he writing his resignation before the game?'. Gullit's selection gambit did not pay off and Newcastle ended up losing 2-1 to Sunderland at St James' Park . 'We actually went 1-0 up but they turned it around and then the heavens opened. It was a dreadful night.' The following morning Shearer went to see Gullit, only Ferguson had beaten him to it, knocking the door off the hinges, legend has it. By the end of the week he had quit. Carver was also by Alan Pardew's side during the last four derby defeats, a factor the former manager admits did him little favours with the Toon Army. In that respect, Carver knows how much a positive result could aid his chances of landing the job on a permanent basis. 'In the eyes of the fans, if you win a derby game, it's massive,' he said. 'I'm not saying everything else is forgotten, but it certainly helps your case. If I come off and it's not been a football match but we win 1-0, I'll be delighted with that. 'We had a good football match last weekend (2-1 defeat at home to Arsenal) and got nothing for it. At the end of the day, it's all about getting the win.'

"(CNN)If you're famous and performing the American national anthem, be prepared to become a national hero or a national disgrace. Facts are facts.  Just ask Vince, Whitney, Roseanne, Jimi and Michael. Mötley Crüe's Vince Neil reminded us again this week of the dangers of tackling ""The Star-Spangled Banner."" Sure, he can shred it on ""Girls, Girls, Girls"" and ""Dr. Feelgood,"" but this is a different story -- a completely different story. To say Neil butchered the song before the Las Vegas Outlaws Arena Football League game would be unkind to those in the profession.  There's less carnage when butchers are done with their work. The late Whitney Houston set the modern standard for the national anthem at Super Bowl XXV.  In the early stages of the Gulf War in 1991, a patriotic America saluted her performance. Just six months earlier, comedian Roseanne Barr may have established the low-water mark. The crowd at the San Diego Padres game booed her rendition and President George H. W. Bush called it ""disgraceful."" There's nothing quite like getting the presidential thumbs down. One of the most controversial and beloved versions of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" comes from 1969. Guitar slinger Jimi Hendrix inflamed mainstream America with his psychedelic take on the national anthem to the delight of the Woodstock generation. And then there's Michael Bolton's version.  Overly wrought songs are his specialty and he doesn't disappoint in that department when he sings at the American League Championship Series in 2003.  Bolton belts it out, but there's one little problem -- the words.  Can anyone say crib notes?",Singing the national anthem is a risky proposition . Whitney Houston nailed it; Roseanne Barr destroyed it .,eeafdc8b2d8130cabda5aafe352eab1198d0b9f8

Susan Kangal, who was on a boat, told WSFA it was the worst storm that she has seen. 'We were probably an inch from capsizing; everybody was ready to jump. I didn't have a life jacket on,' she said.

"Beaten FA Cup semi-finalists Reading lost again as they were defeated by Birmingham in a scrappy Sky Bet Championship game at the Madejski Stadium on Wednesday night. Although Reading dominated most of the match, they wasted several chances in the closing stages of the first half. Birmingham held firm and grabbed the winner seven minutes from the end, when Clayton Donaldson nodded in his 16th goal of the season. Clayton Donaldson (left) scored a late headed winner for Birmingham City as his side defeated Reading 1-0 . Donaldson, who signed from Brentford in the summer, scored his 16th goal of the season .

Referee: Lee Mason . Attendance: 14,604 . Reading were involved in a dramatic 2-1 defeat against Arsenal, after extra-time, in the last four of the Cup at Wembley on Saturday. Goalkeeper Adam Federici, whose fumble led to Alexis Sanchez's winning goal, was retained against Birmingham - as were six of his fellow starters from Wembley. At least Reading had no pressure on them, the last lingering doubts of relegation having been removed when Millwall lost 2-0 at Blackburn Rovers on Tuesday night. Birmingham had little to play for either, apart from trying to improve on a poor recent record of just two wins in eight league matches. A predictably dour opening, with neither side keen to force the pace, ended when Wes Thomas aimed at Federici. But it was a weak effort that did not trouble the Australian goalkeeper. Reading, with only two wins in 13 league games behind them and no wins in six, responded swiftly as the game warmed up. Garath McCleary, scorer of Reading's equaliser against Arsenal, fired wide after a long pass from Jake Cooper. A Cooper header lacked the power to test Birmingham keeper Darren Randolph, Jamie Mackie shot wide after Jem Karacan had been blocked out, and Mackie and Nick Blackman had close-range efforts cleared to safety. Randolph made a flying save to keep out a fierce McCleary shot and the keeper also had to stop two decent long-range attempts from Nathaniel Chalobah. Reading fans showed their support for Adam Federci following his blunder at Wembley on Saturday . Donaldson goes one-on-one with Federici, who was hoping to make amends for his mistake against Arsenal . Birmingham threatened only rarely, Paul Caddis blazing over from a Diego Fabbrini cross, which Donaldson had missed, and Jonathan Grounds heading straight at Federici from a Caddis corner. Reading kept up the momentum after the interval but, as Birmingham defended stubbornly, the home side spoiled good approach work with poor final touches. Nathan Ake did manage to fashion a chance when wriggling clear of his markers but drove straight at Randolph. Reading lost their second game in as many matches as their poor Championship form continues . Birmingham continued to sit back, inviting the pressure. Jordan Obita missed with a powerful drive and then drilled over a low cross that no team-mate was able to reach. Andrew Shinnie was off target from distance but Reading regained the upper hand with efforts from Chalobah, a 20-yard shot saved by Randolph, substitute Jack Stacey and Ake. Birmingham rallied late on, with Federici having to make two smart saves to deny substitute Demarai Gray. And the visitors broke the deadlock in the 83rd minute. Stephen Gleeson delivered a corner from the left and Donaldson rose unchallenged to glance a header past the helpless Federici.",Reading are 18th in the Championship while Birmingham City sit in 15th .

The mother-of-two suddenly lost all control of her body and crashed her car last May. In the days after the accident she lost control of her bladder and was shaking uncontrollably . 'It wasn't a bad accident, but I went home shaken and had a drink,' she said. 'I just couldn't stop shaking. 'The next day I wet myself and I wet the bed for the next three nights. 'But I didn't know what was wrong with me, and thought I had a trapped nerve or something like that. 'Even a year on, I have no feeling in my bladder, and I don't know when I need the toilet or even when I am actually weeing. 'There is no sign that will ever return. 'When I was told I had FND, I didn't even know what  it was and it just isn't out there, it's so rare.' Following her accident on May 26, last year, Mrs Rawcliffe was taken to the Royal Preston Hospital to meet neurologists. They eventually diagnosed the rare illness functional neurological disorder in September, following a series of tests. Last September doctors diagnosed the rare brain disorder. Mrs Rawcliffe is now confined to her house, unable to walk and relies on a mobility scooter. Each day she has to take a cocktail of 32 different drugs . Mrs Rawcliffe, from Morecambe, has since had to give up her job as a teaching assistant, and can no longer drive. She struggles to walk further than eight metres, and relies on a mobility scooter to get around. Functional neurological disorder is an umbrella term that covers a variety of symptoms that cannot be explained. The condition can be as debilitating as Parkinson's disease and MS, and may share many common symptoms. Very few effective treatment plans exist. Physical therapy is often the most effective form of treatment, with the aim of reintroducing proper movement and motor control. Many patients are also prescribed cognitive behaviour therapy. The condition can cause the following symptoms: . Source: FND Hope . The 40-year-old spends most of her time confined to her home, and has to take 32 tablets each day to prevent choking fits and tremors. 'Life is quite boring and I can't do anything myself whether it's washing, showering, cooking cleaning,' she said. 'Before I was diagnosed I was going to the gym five times a week and I loved my job. I'm 40 - I never wanted to retire. 'In fact, I get quite tearful when I think about it and my old colleagues always say there is a hole where Sam should be at work. 'I've got no independence anymore and I sold my car in the end because I was sick of looking at it.' Doctors cannot determine whether the condition had been lying dormant in Mrs Rawcliffe's body before it revealed itself. She suffered a mini-stroke as a teenager but recovered within three weeks and met her husband Phillip a few months later. Despite back pain from another car accident 12 years ago, the mother-of-two has not suffered any other ailments. Power plant technician Phillip, 47, and the couple's children Rhys, 19 and Rebecca, 17, have rallied to help. 'I think the kids took it hard at first - there was a lot of crying,' Mrs Rawcliffe said. 'But I have a big family and support network and they have all adapted so brilliantly. 'I used to be the life and soul of the party and I've never been a miserable person but there is so much that I can't do and it's hard to take. 'I end up kind of mourning for the life that I had had before this.' Mrs Rawcliffe is hoping to raise awareness of the condition by drumming up funds for the organisation FND Hope to help boost support for sufferers.

"Police in Houston say a 34-year-old man got behind the wheel of his car while under the influence Sunday, leaving a path of destruction in his wake and killing two people, one of them a 6-year-old boy. Blaine Boudreaux has been charged with intoxication manslaughter, intoxicated assault and failure to stop and render aid involving death in connection to at least three separate DUI collisions that took place within three hours in Houston. Boudreaux, who also has an extensive DUI record in his native Louisiana, was allegedly drunk when he ran a red light on Lockwood Drive at around 6.3opm and slammed his Dodge pickup truck into a Honda Civic. Path of destruction: Blaine Boudreaux (left), 34, has been charged in connection to three separate DUI crashes in Houston that killed 6-year-old Josh Medrano, injured his mother and led to the death of a homeless man . Heartbroken: The family of 6-year-old Joshua Medrano are seen Wednesday leaving the courtroom where Blaine Boudreaux made an appearance on charges stemming from a trio of accidents in Houston. On of the boy's relatives screamed at the suspect: 'I hope you die!' Joshua Medrano, 6, who was a passenger in the sedan, was fatally injured. His mother, Cynthia, was hospitalized with a punctured lung and broken bones. Boudreaux was arrested at the scene after failing a field sobriety test. Three wrecks: The 34-year-old, who has a history of DUIs in Louisiana, is also accused of crashing into another car carrying a woman and a toddler . Several hours earlier, according to police, the 34-year-old man struck and killed 61-year-old vagrant Leonard Batiste walking along Texas 5 Spur near the University of Houston. Investigators say the homeless man was mowed down at around 5.15pm Sunday but his body was not discovered until Monday afternoon. Boudreaux’s entire bumper, complete with his license plate, was found nearby. Blaine Boudreaux also has been linked to a third collision that occurred about two hours before Batiste's death. The two-car crash took place in the 6600 block of Fannin Street and involved a mother and her 2-year-old child, who were taken to a hospital and later released. In that case, Boudreaux was issued a ticket by a police officer and allowed to leave the scene. After slamming into the elderly man on Texas 5 Spur, Boudreaux allegedly dozed off behind the wheel and didn't wake up until another driver honked at him to get his attention. That is when he ran the red light at the intersection of Lockwood and the East Freeway and slammed into Cynthia Medrano's black Honda, killing her son, according to officials. Joseph Rodriguez, the boy's stepfather, said little Joshua wanted to become a firefighter when he grew up. Rodriguez said the officer who stopped Boudreaux after the first accident involving the mother and toddler should have detained him instead of letting the man go. Prosecutor Alison Baimbridge told the Houston Chronicle investigators are now looking into that collision and resulting citation in light of Boudreaux's apparent intoxication about two hours. Cynthia Medrano, pictured here with her family, was driving Sunday evening with her young son in the passenger seat when police say Boudreaux ran a red light and plowed into her Honda Civic . Doomed: Even though the 6-year-old was buckled in, he suffered fatal injuries and died upon arriving at a hospital . When questioned by police after his arrest, Boudreaux allegedly admitted that he had taken anti-depressants and a drug used to treat addiction to opiates before getting behind the wheel of his pickup truck Sunday afternoon. Blaine Boudreaux, a Catholic school dropout who moved to Houston in his late teens, has recently lost his home security business and allowed his pharmacy technician license to lapse, reported the Chronicle. During his arraignment Wednesday morning, prosecutors revealed that the suspect has multiple outstanding warrants for DUIs in Louisiana. In one case, he also had jumped bail. In light of these facts, his bond was set at $100,000 on each of the three counts, reported the station KTRK. Boudreaux’s arraignment was attended by several members of Joshua Medrano's family who sobbed in court and showed Boudreaux the middle finger. One woman cried out 'I hope you die!' as the suspect clad in an orange jumpsuit was being led out of the courtroom.

"Pep Guardiola has denied claims of a dispute with former Bayern Munich club doctor Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt, who quit the club on Thursday after 'being blamed' for the defeat by Porto. The 72-year-old, who had worked at Bayern for almost 40 years, sensationally quit the Bundesliga club, claiming 'the bond of trust is damaged', but Guardiola has played down claims of a feud. 'The reaction is on me, I was disappointed,' he told reporters in the wake of a shock Champions League quarter-final defeat by Porto. 'It was nothing to do with the doctor.

Continuing at his press conference on Thursday, Guardiola said: 'The responsibility for the defeat in Porto lies with me. Put together, my players have had 30 operations over the last two years, but we've still won the league and cup. 'We can't win every match 3-0 or 4-0 in this situation. It's impossible.'

"A Missouri inmate was executed Tuesday night for killing a man in a fit of rage over child support payments 16 years ago. Andre Cole, 52, became the third convicted killer put to death this year in Missouri. His fate was sealed after the U.S. Supreme Court turned down several appeals, including one claiming Cole was mentally ill and unfit for execution. Cole was executed by lethal injection at 10.15pm on Tuesday at the Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center in Bonne Terre, Missouri and was pronounced dead at 10.24pm, a spokesman for the Missouri Department of Corrections wrote in a statement to Daily Mail Online. Scroll down for video . Andre Cole, 52, became the third convicted killer put to death this year in Missouri . He declined to order a last meal and received the day's inmate tray meal of a turkey and bologna sandwich, a cookie and fruit punch. He did not provide a final written statement, the spokesman said. Department of Corrections Director George A. Lombardi read the following statement from Gov. Jay Nixon: 'Next week marks the observance of Crime Victims’ Rights Week in Missouri, and tonight I ask the people of our state to especially remember Anthony Curtis, murdered by the man whose sentence was carried out tonight. 'Far too often, the names of those who are victims of violent crime, such as Anthony Curtis, are the names that are forgotten. 'Please join us in keeping Anthony Curtis and his loved ones in your thoughts and prayers.' On Tuesday, Gov. Nixon refused a clemency petition that raised concerns about the fact that Cole, who was black, was convicted and sentenced by an all-white jury. Cole and his wife, Terri, were married for 11 years and had two children before divorcing in 1995. The couple fought about visitation and he was upset about child support payments, authorities said. By 1998, Cole was $3,000 behind in child support. Attorney General Chris Koster said Cole became angry when he learned that a payroll withholding order was issued to his employer, taking the money out of his check. 'Before I give her another dime, I'll kill (her),' Cole told co-workers, according to Koster. The first deduction appeared on his August 21, 1998, paycheck. Hours later, Cole forced his way into his ex-wife's home by throwing a tire jack through a glass door, Koster said. He was confronted by Curtis, a friend who was visiting. Andre Cole used a kitchen knife to repeatedly stab Curtis, then Terri Cole. Curtis died but Terri Cole survived. Cole fled the state but surrendered 33 days later. He claimed at trial that he did not bring a weapon into Terri Cole's house and that Curtis initiated the attack with a knife. Andre Cole's brother, DeAngelo Cole, 38, of Las Vegas, said the attack was out of character for his sibling. He called it a crime of passion. 'It was a one-time thing,' DeAngelo Cole said. 'He didn't have a history of that kind of behavior.' Cole's attorney, Joseph Luby, said Cole's mental health deteriorated during the more than a decade he spent in prison. He said Cole was plagued by psychosis and constantly heard voices in his head. Cole was executed by lethal injection at 10.15pm on Tuesday at the Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional Center (above) in Bonne Terre, Missouri . The courts were not convinced. Both the Missouri Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to halt the execution based on mental health concerns. The U.S. Supreme Court also turned away appeals based on Missouri's secretive method of obtaining the execution drug pentobarbital and over how instructions were given to the jury. The jury itself was the source of the clemency request to Nixon. Advocates for Cole, including the NAACP, the American Civil Liberties Union and others, said his case was among many in which St. Louis County prosecutors unfairly prohibited black jurors from hearing a death penalty case involving a black suspect. All 12 jurors in Cole's case were white. Kimber Edwards, who was scheduled for execution in May, was also convicted and sentenced by an all-white jury. The Missouri Supreme Court, without explanation, canceled the execution orders for Edwards earlier this month. Missouri tied Texas for the most executions in 2014 with 10. Missouri has now executed 15 men since November 2013.","Andre Cole, 52, became the third convicted killer put to death this year in Missouri and was executed by lethal injection on Tuesday .

"A woman who died suddenly was eaten by her pet dogs after her body lay undiscovered for days, an inquest was told. Noelle Baynham was found by a close friend who let himself in after she failed to answer the door. The body had been partially eaten by the Jack Russell and Staffordshire Bull Terrier, which are initially thought to have tried to wake her before becoming desperate for food. It is believed the 61-year-old from Winchester, Hampshire, collapsed and died following an accidental overdose of medication. Eaten: Noelle Baynham's dogs started to eat her remains after being locked in the house for days. The most likely cause of death was an accidental overdose, an inquest was told . However a pathologist could not determine the exact cause of death because the dogs, who were trapped in the house, ate parts of her vital organs. Concerned friend Grant Donovan made the 'horrific' discovery of her remains after nobody answered the front door at her home. He told the inquest that he could hear her two dogs barking and jumping behind the door and became concerned that there did not appear to be anyone in with them. Finding the back door unlocked, he entered the house where he said the floors were covered in dog faeces. Walking through, he then discovered Ms Baynham's body lying on the landing. 'This was the most horrifying thing I have ever seen,' he told the inquest. 'I could not look at her long, so I just came away and called 999.' Detectives who searched the house following the grim discovery, on January 17 this year, could find no evidence of a struggle or foul play. The hearing was told how former jeweller Ms Baynham was found was in her dressing gown and had run a bath just before her death. Pets: A Staffordshire Bull Terrier (left) and Jack Russell (right) like the ones owned by Noelle Baynham . Detective Constable Wesley Arnold from Hampshire Police told the coroner that scratch marks on her chest indicated that her dogs may have tried to wake her after she collapsed. Home Office pathologist Dr Amanda Jeffery reaveled that she had probably died 'a few days' before she was found, but because the dogs had eaten her organs it was impossible to establish exactly what had killed her. The 'combined effect' of a variety of drugs found in her system was likely to have been the cause of an accidental overdose, she added. The hearing was told that Ms Baynham suffered from bipolar disorder and chronic alcoholism and was prescribed a variety of medication. Blood tests found a range of drugs in her system including potentially toxic levels of painkillers. Recording an open verdict, senior central Hampshire coroner Grahame Short ruled that there was no evidence of suicide or an accidental fall, but said Ms Baynham may have had a stroke. 'The horrific element in this case is what happened after death rather than before, and it's entirely plausible that when there are dogs in the house with no one to care for them, that they will then start to eat her remains. 'That clearly was a major hindrance to Dr Jeffery in her examination, and as she's explained, she was not able to look at her important organs and she could not establish a clear cause of death. 'I have to say there's no sign to say this was a deliberate overdose. There can come a point where [the drug level over time is] just too high and one pill too many can tip over the balance.' The dogs were subsequently put down on the advice of police officers.",Jack Russell and Staffordshire Bull Terrier were trapped in house .

"A predatory convicted paedophile with an obsession with young girls has gone on the run after vanishing from a psychiatric unit. Stephen Munden, 54, described as having a 'fanatical obsession' with small girls after he targeted a toddler on a bus, has been missing since 6.15pm on Tuesday and was last seen leaving a hospital, near Hook, Hampshire. Now officers have launched a manhunt to find Munden  - who was detained under the Mental Health Act after sexually touching the three-year-old girl. A predatory convicted paedophile with an obsession with young girls has gone on the run after vanishing from a psychiatric unit. Stephen Munden, 54, (pictured with and without a beard) was last seen leaving a hospital, near Hook, Hampshire . He is described as about 5ft 8ins tall, of a heavy build, and has dark hair. Officers said they believed that Munden, who suffers from learning difficulties, may have shaved off his beard before leaving the hospital in Winchfield and have released images of him with both facial hair and a clean shave. He was detained at the private facility under a hospital order following his sentence last August for sexual offences. Munden was convicted of sexually touching a child under the age of 13. A court heard he deliberately sat near a three-year-old girl and stroked her hand with his finger - in full view of the child's mother and grandmother. Munden, formerly of Marchwood, near Southampton, denied the offence, claiming it was accidental when he appeared at Southampton Crown Court. During the sentencing David Jenkins, prosecuting, told Judge Peter Henry that the defendant had admitted ten unrelated offences of possessing or attempting to possess indecent images of children. The court heard he had been arrested after using one of the public computers at Hythe library in an attempt to download images. Mr Jenkins said children's clothes, books and dolls were found at Munden's home and added: 'He has a fanatical obsession with young girls.' A court heard he deliberately sat near a three-year-old girl and stroked her hand with his finger - in full view of the child's mother and grandmother. Munden, formerly of Marchwood, near Southampton, denied the offence, claiming it was accidental when he appeared at Southampton Crown Court . Consultant physiatrist John O'Shea said the defendant was autistic and also suffered from mild learning difficulties. He added that Munden had difficulty controlling his sexual interest in small children but the girl on the bus was probably unaware of his intentions. Keely Harvey, in mitigation, said: 'He did not accept that he deliberately touched the child's hand.' But the judge said 'the move from non-contact offences to a contact offence is significant' and he was made the subject of a hospital order. Detective Chief Inspector Tim Rowlandson said: 'We are extremely keen to hear from anyone who has seen this man since yesterday evening or knows where he might be. 'Mr Munden is subject to a hospital order after being convicted and sentenced for sexual offences and also suffers from learning difficulties, so we need to know where he is as a matter of urgency.'","Stephen Munden, 54, has absconded from hospital, near Hook, Hampshire .

Since he wasn't certain what kind of shark was gathering south of the inlet, Massung posted the photos to the Indian River by Air Facebook page to see if any experts could offer some enlightenment. Most responded that the sharks looked like either Blacktips or Spinners, which migrate this time of year to breed. The picture had been shared more than 2,000 times by Sunday.

"It may have been Miley Cyrus' pink heart-shaped nipple pasties that garnered all the attention when she paid honour to rocker Joan Jett on Saturday, but eagle-eyed fans were distracted by something else. Savvy social media users noticed that the 22-year-old, who attended the 30th Annual Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame Induction Ceremony on Saturday in Cleveland, Ohio, had given her razor a night off. Miley, 22, who is known and loved for her controversial sartorial choices, displayed a somewhat bushy underarm region as she posed for a social media snap. Scroll down for video . Miley Cyrus posed for a social media snap ahead of the 30th Annual Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame Induction Ceremony on Saturday in Cleveland, Ohio... and it appears that she had given her razor a night off . One user, Hayley Mashteare, commented: 'Miley Cyrus doesn't shave her armpits and that worries me', while Gucci Girl said that star's armpit hairs were 'freaking her out'. Jennifer Sidlow chimed in: 'Don't care how feminist/hippy you are, having armpit hair like Miley Cyrus is just no'. One fan account added: 'Armpit hair is disgusting, please shave Miley Cyrus.' Miley Cyrus bares her armpits as she speaks onstage during the 30th Annual Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame Induction Ceremony at Public Hall on Saturday . Miley's somewhat bushy underarm area caused quite a stir on social media where many users advised Miley to pick up a razor and shave . Some users leapt to her defence, with El adding: 'Why do people even care that Miley Cyrus has armpit hair? Like wow imagine that, a human with hair! How gross!' A lot of users didn't understand why people were 'freaking out' over the singer's armpit hair, with Charlie saying: 'Miley Cyrus' armpit hair isn't ""hideous"", we all see men's armpit hair but that's apparently acceptable because they're men. Please shut up' Of course, loyal fans sprung to her defence. One, named Abi, tweeted: 'Stop telling @MileyCyrus to shave her armpits? She's a woman. She doesn't have to do what you say! There is nothing wrong with body hair.' Stephanie added: 'People are losing their minds over Miley Cyrus not shaving her armpits.. how can hair offend you? It's hair...' El jumped in: 'Why do people even care that Miley Cyrus has armpit hair? Like wow imagine that, a human with hair! How gross!'. Whilst Miley's personal grooming habits caused a social media stir, she isn't the first - and probably won't be the last - to shun her razor in favour of the fuzz. Scout Willis is also more than happy to show off her armpit hair on the red carpet and in her social media snaps.

One picture, which was taken during a fitness session with sisters Rumer, 26, and Tallulah, 20, ignited debate on Tallulah's social media page, with one Instagram follower writing: ‘Pit hair is just ugly and stinky.’ And she found support from a fan who responded: ‘Be comfortable in your own skin and do your thing girls!! As a mom of 3 daughters myself that's all I've got to say!’ Another follower added: ‘Guys open your minds! We are not all made the same way!’ Madonna, Pixie Lott, Juliette Lewis and Julia Roberts have all famously tried the carefree look, too.

"Tens of millions of people in China marked the annual 'Tomb Sweeping Festival' this weekend by travelling home to their ancestral villages. Families across the country descended on graveyards to clean their tombs of the deceased and honour their loved ones, burning fake paper money and leaving their favourite food and drink to ensure they are not poor or hungry in the afterlife. As part of the Qingming Festival – which means 'pure brightness' – China celebrates the coming spring and the beauty of nature, says People’s Daily Online. A grand and colourful ceremony was held in honour of the 'Yellow Emperor' Huangdi in Huangling County, Shaanxi Province . Huangdi is considered the ancestor of the Qingming Festival which sees the Chinese mark the start of spring with outdoor celebrations . Lines of dancers take to the stage as part of the celebration, which was watched by thousands of people during the public holiday . Around 1.3 billion Chinese people marked the Qingming Festival, a three-day holiday in China, by watching parades and travelling home . Traditional Chinese dancers wear intricate gowns as they swirl and dance in the sunshine during the celebrations in the city of Huangi . An actor dressed as a soldier takes a break from the celebration to check his phone . In Shaanxi Province, a huge outdoor celebration was held as part of the Qingming Festival and in honour of the 'Yellow Emperor' Huang Di, considered the founding father of the Chinese nation. A bell was rung from the top of the city's temple, while the drums were struck 34 times, one for each of China's provinces including Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan. The festival falls in the first week of April every year, and is one of the 24 Chinese solar terms - the date from which temperatures rise, rainfall increases and marks an important time for the land to be prepared for the sowing of seeds. Hundreds of visitors filmed the celebrations on their smart phones, as a colourful inflatable dragon dances in the sky. It is said that the Yellow Emperor Huang Di did not die, but instead ascended into heaven on the back of a dragon - making the creature a Chinese symbol . Participants carry platters of fruit as part of the ceremony in the central China, which had hundreds of dancers and performers .

A young performer casts a smile on a guard, as she fixed her hair during the Qingming festival celebrations . Dancers make offerings to the water in a service at the Duijang Dam for Qingming - praying for favourable weather for their crops . Opinion on the origins of the festival differ, but it can be traced back to the Tang Dynasty which ruled China between 618 and 907. While millions of Chinese people made the trip to their ancestral villages, opportunistic traders took advantage of some people's inability to make the visit - advertising 'tomb sweeping packages' which include weeping, praying and cleaning. Depending on the package, costing between 100 yuan and 1,300 yuan, the buyer receives a commemorative photo of the occasion. A record-breaking 36.5 million passenger trips were made over the weekend and public holiday - up 5.8 per cent on last year and an all-time high. The rise is partially due to the construction of new railways in recent years, particularly high-speed railway, say commentators. A couple pray as they burn paper money during Qingming.

"A Church of Scientology-backed organization is facing a bizarre land use battle over its plans to turn a patch of secluded in woods near the presidential retreat Camp David into a drug rehab center. Lawyers hired by drug rehab network Narcocon have argued that Trout Run, a property in Frederick County, Maryland, has historic significance because President Herbert Hoover once caught a fish at the site. Opponents view the proposed designation as a trick to circumvent current zoning laws for the 40-acre plot of land and create a drug rehabilitation program that some call dangerous. Narcocon, a Church of Scientology-affiliated drug rehab network, is trying to prove that a patch of land near Camp David is historic enough so that they can build a center for twelve patients . A Scientology-back real estate company bought Trout Run for $4.85million in 2013, and has been trying to change its land designation so that it can build a center that uses saunas and vitamin therapy for addicts . Narcocon, which uses sauna sessions and the teachings of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard, has been sued in the past for wrongful deaths. It has denied wrongdoing. The group's treatment program claims that megadoses of the vitamin Niacin and spending five hours a day in a sauna for a month eliminates addiction cravings that are stored in the body's fat cells. Treatments at the center can cost more than $30,000 per month and typically last for as long as six months. Narcocon officials, who run more than 120 centers around the world, deny that the program tries to convert addicts to Scientology, though the group prominently features a quote from Hubbard on its website. The organization says that is focused on a secular approach to helping people overcome addiction. Its Maryland center would house 12 patients, with eight staff living there and eight living off-site. However, the current zoning laws for Trout Run, which includes a collection of stone cottages, classify it for resource conservation and do not permit any medical purpose for the site, according to the Washington Post. Though Narcocon says that it is non-religious and does not try to convert people to Scientology, its website features the religion's founder L Ron Hubbard (pictured) prominently . Placing the property on the county register of historic places would allow Narconon to conduct its program. The rehabilitation program was founded in 1966 and is based on the teachings of Scientology's founder L. Ron Hubbard. Narconon claims it is a non-religious, non-profit, non-medical . rehabilitation program with patients around the world. Its methods include . spending up to five hours a day in a sauna for 30 days straight and mega . doses of the vitamin Niacin. The hypothesis underlying the program is . that drugs and their metabolites are stored in the body's fatty tissues . for years, causing the addict's cravings when partially released later . on. But these can be flushed out through a regimen comprising elements such as . exercise, sauna and intake of high doses of vitamins, according to the facility's methods. This hypothesis does not enjoy . mainstream acceptance, and researchers and practitioners tend . to discount Narconon due to its connection with Scientology. No independent study that has not been funded by the center exist to confirm the supposed efficacy of its treatment, which has repeatedly been cited as curing 75 per cent of addicts. Since its establishment, it has faced considerable controversy over the . safety and effectiveness of its rehabilitation methods and the . organization's links to the Church of Scientology. Fees can sometimes reach more than $30,000 per month and centers bring in millions of dollars a year from patients. An aide of Herbert Hoover bought the property in the late 1920s and the president went on fishing trips there,  the Frederick News Post reported. Narcocon hired a consultant whose history of Trout Run said that Hoover 'reeled in a fine one-and-one-half pound trout' during a visit. 'No President was born or died there. No epic battles were won or lost, no proclamations penned, no foreign dignitaries lodged and feted,' local drug counselor Kristin Milne-Glasser wrote in opposition to the historic designation. She said that the area merits a roadside plaque at most. President Dwight Eisenhower and other Washington elites also fished at Trout Run during his time in office. Frederick County's Historic Preservation Commission ruled that the site is eligible to be voted onto the register because of its early 20th century architecture. Social Betterment Properties International, a real estate company tied to Scientology, bought the land in 2013 for $4.85million from a government official who had long been trying to sell it. Narconon has been working on building its center since. County councilors delayed voting on the measure two weeks ago so they could have more time to review the proposal and plan to grant or deny approval on Tuesday. Beyond questions of history, opponents to the rehab center have cited safety concerns about the mysterious organization being so close to Camp David and Narcocon's alleged checkered past. Celebrity Scientologists such as John Travolta and Tom Cruise have repeated Narconon's message about how it saves 75 per cent of addicts. Trout Run was first built and developed by an aide of President Herbert Hoover (right) in the late 1920s. It is located in a woods several miles from presidential retreat Camp David (left during G8 Summit in 2012) Trout Run in Maryland was used for fishing by President Hoover (right) and President Dwight Eisenhower (left) during their times in office (file photo, Colorado, 1954) However, the organization previously lost its license  in Georgia after the death of  28-year-old former Marine Patrick Desmond, who was being treated for alcoholism but died after allegedly trying heroin for the first time while in treatment. Previous deaths at Narcocon include three young people who  died within a year at a flagship Oklahoma facility, according to NBC. Hilary Holten, 21, was found dead in her bed at the center in April 2012 of unknown causes. Stacy Murphy, 20, died of an oxymorphone overdose in July. Gabriel Graves, a 32-year-old father of two, died of unknown causes in October 2011. Narconon denied responsibility for any patient deaths. The group's Arrowhead in Oklahoma was estimated to have brought in $10.88million in revenue in 2011. The group has already approached the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene about acquiring a license for its facility but has not filed an application. Its website says it currently runs 16 centers in the United States, though the only one on the East Coast is in Massachusetts. Narcocon and its rehab network have attracted criticism from residents in western Maryland for its checkered past, though celebrities such as Tom Cruise (pictured, 2004) endorse it .

"Such has been the volatility at the top of the Championship this season that predicting future outcomes has proved a futile exercise, but what is certain is that Middlesbrough hold the aces. With just four weeks remaining, Aitor Karanka's team are top of a division that has witnessed the leadership change hands 15 times. Seven points separate eight teams with six matches to play but Boro know if they keep winning, they cannot be caught. Their buffer over second-placed Bournemouth is a point with Watford, their opponents on Monday, and Norwich a point further back. Patrick Bamford (left) of Middlesbrough celebrates his goal against Wigan with his team mates . Another advantage for the Teesside club is that their contest at Vicarage Road is a lunchtime kick-off. As they discovered on Good Friday, when they triumphed over relegation-threatened Wigan, stealing a march can have a psychological effect. Previous leaders Bournemouth and 10-man Watford could only draw, at Ipswich and Derby respectively, in the evening matches. 'It definitely puts pressure on other teams, like Watford and Bournemouth found on Friday night,' said Boro defender Ben Gibson. 'It gives us a few more hours to recover when the turnaround for games is short and sharp, as well. Monday will be the same, big style.' Watford's 18-goal striker Odion Ighalo intends to have a say in what happens next. Ighalo helped Granada reach La Liga in 2011 and admits he only signed for Watford to play in the English top flight. Odion Ighalo rescued a point for Watford with this equaliser against fellow promotion hopefuls Derby . Bournemouth have been this season's surprise package and led the Championship for 101 days . 'I came to Watford not because I want to play in the Championship but because I have the opportunity to be in the Premier League,' he said. 'Our fans have to scream from the start to the end. I know by God's grace we are going to win that game at home.' Such is the precarious nature of the promotion race, however, that the division could have a completely different top two on Monday evening if Watford and Norwich, who host mid-table Sheffield Wednesday, win and Bournemouth fail to secure three points against Birmingham. With the stakes so high it is perhaps understandable that Karanka is hoping Jonathan Woodgate, his experienced captain, can continue to play through the pain. He missed the recent defeat at Bournemouth due to his broken toe but returned against Wigan. Crucially, each of the defender's five appearances this season, and eight of his last nine, have resulted in wins. Alex Neil (left) has impressed since taking over at Norwich and the Canaries remain in contention at the top . Derby led the way earlier in the season but have now not won in seven games under Steve McClaren . Derby, meanwhile, have seemingly forgotten how to win. Seven games without victory has seen them slump to sixth but Steve McClaren insists he will not sacrifice his principles. McClaren, who takes his team to Wigan, said: 'I don't want to put 10 defenders on and kick the ball long and not play our football. We have a certain way of playing, a certain style, which has got us where we are.' The eighth side in the division are Wolves, who have the most potent striker in 28-goal Benik Afobe, signed from Arsenal for £2million in January. Afobe has made himself instantly at home and has Leeds in his sights today. Final word to the English forward: 'Every time we go into the changing room we see everyone else has won.'

"Aston Villa may be gearing up for an FA Cup semi-final clash against Liverpool on Sunday, but that didn't stop manager Tim Sherwood having some fun during a press conference on Friday. Sherwood showed his softer side during the week when he replied to a letter from six-year-old fan Charlie Pye who had applied for the Villa hotseat after Paul Lambert was sacked in February. The Villa youngster wanted a chocolate bar as a win bonus and would have agreed terms for a signed claret and blue football, a WWE wrestling figure and some sweets - and Sherwood had some fun on Friday as he revealed his 'win bonus' to the assembled media.

"Documented and undocumented immigrant population in the United States could reach a record high of 51million in just eight years, according to U.S. Census figures. And by 2060, immigrants could account for 82 per cent of all population growth in the country. One in seven U.S. residents will be an immigrant by 2023, the report from the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS) said. Documented and undocumented immigrants in the United States could reach a record high in the United States by 2023, when their share of the population could hit 14.8 per cent . That number could rise to one in five by 2060, when immigrant population reaches 78 million. This report comes as President Barack Obama is trying to use executive powers to expand Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) policies. Net immigration will steadily increase over the next 45 years, totaling at 64million . Without no change in current immigration policy, by 2023 the total immigrant population in the United states will reach 14.8 per cent, the highest ever recorded in American history . Immigration population will grow almost four times faster than native-born population and will reach 15.8 per cent of the nation's population by 2030, 17.1 per cent by 2040 and 18.8 per cent by 2060 . In 1990, immigrants accounted for just 7.9 per cent of U.S. population . U.S population could grow to 417million by 2016. In 2010 the population was 306million . Without a change to immigration policty, immigrants who arrive in the future and their descendants could account for three quarters of future U.S. population . Center for Immigration Studies . This could potentially exempt about five million undocumented immigrants from deportation. And with the surge in immigrant population, Republican presidential candidates have to figure out what their stance is on the subject as potential new policies could be established. CIS director of research Steven Camarota said that the growth in immigrant population has 'important implications for workers, schools, infrastructure, congestion and the environment'. 'They also may have implications for our ability to successfully assimilate and integrate immigrants,' he added. 'Yet there has been almost no national debate about bringing in so many people legally each year, which is the primary factor driving these numbers.' Currently there are approximately 12million undocumented immigrants in the United States and 70,000 more are expected to cross the border this year, according to the Washington Examiner. There are also more than 4.4million people on a U.S. State Department green card waiting list. And within years, Immigration population will grow almost four times faster than native-born population. From a starting point of 2010, immigration population will reach 15.8 per cent (57million) of the nation's population by 2030, 17.1 (65million) per cent by 2040 and 18.8 per cent (78million)  by 2060. Immigrants and their descendants will account for 75.5 per cent of the nation's population growth between 2010 and 2050 and 82 per cent of growth between 2010 and 2060. By 2060, immigrants and their descendants will account for 82 per cent of the nation's population growth since 2010 . President Barack Obama is trying to use executive powers to expand immigration policies, which could potentially exempt about 5million undocumented immigrants from deportation . Alabama Rep. Sen. Jeff Sessions, who has been a leader in the immigration debate, said in a letter to the New York Times on Saturday that an increase of immigrants in the country will hurt the middle class. He wrote: 'It defies reason to argue that the record admission of new foreign workers has no negative effect on the wages of American workers, including the wages of past immigrants hoping to climb into the middle class. 'Why would many of the largest business groups in the United States spend millions lobbying for the admission of more foreign workers if such policies did not cut labor costs?'

"Despite the hype surrounding its first watch, the iPhone is still the engine behind Apple's phenomenal success, its latest figures have revealed. The results far surpassed most analysts' expectations for the first three months of the year, when sales traditionally fall from their holiday-season peak. Apple sold more than 61 million iPhones in the quarter, accounting for more than two-thirds of its $58 billion in revenue for the quarter and the lion's share of its $13.6 billion in profit - and up 40% from a year ago . Sales of iPhones in China were also revealed to have outstripped those in the US.

More than 61 million iPhones sole . iPad revenue fell 29% to $5.4 billion . Revenue from Mac computers rose 2%from a year earlier, to $5.6 billion . 'We are thrilled by the continued strength of iPhone, Mac and the App Store, which drove our best March quarter results ever,' said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO. 'We're seeing a higher rate of people switching to iPhone than we've experienced in previous cycles, and we're off to an exciting start to the June quarter with the launch of Apple Watch.' As expected, the numbers were down from the previous quarter, when holiday shoppers snapped up a record 74 million of Apple's new iPhone 6, 6 Plus and older models. But it was a 40 percent increase over the number of iPhones sold in the first three months of 2014. 'We're seeing great results all over the world,' Apple chief financial officer Luca Maestri told The Associated Press, adding that iPhone sales grew 72 percent in China, where the company has big hopes for expansion. Other products played a much smaller role. Revenue from Mac computers rose 2 percent from a year earlier, to $5.6 billion, while iPad revenue fell 29 percent, to $5.4 billion — continuing a steady decline in tablet sales. Apple didn't report any results for the new Apple Watch, which it began selling this month, after the quarter ended. Maestri said customer response had been 'positive.' Analysts estimate about 2 million have sold to date, suggesting early demand is healthy but not of blockbuster proportions. Apple shares have gained more than 50 percent over the last year, making it the world's most valuable company. 'It's been really great to see the reaction of customers,' said Cook. 'The response has been overwhelming. We can't wait to see more of the inspiring apps developers dream up.' The iPhone is another story. Since it began offering models with bigger screens last fall, Apple has vied with South Korea's Samsung for the No. 1 position in the global smartphone market. By some estimates, Apple outsold Samsung in the quarter that ended in December, and analysts will be watching closely when Samsung reports its latest results this week. Apple also announced an expansion of its effort to return more of its sizable cash war chest to investors. The company said it will raise its quarterly dividend by 11 percent, to 52 cents a share, and has increased a $90 billion stock buyback program to $140 billion. Apple didn't report any results for the new Apple Watch, which it began selling this month, after the quarter ended. In total, the company said the program will return $200 billion to investors by the end of March 2017. As iPhone sales have surged, so has Apple's stock. Apple shares have gained more than 50 percent over the last year, making it the world's most valuable company. The stock closed Monday at $132.65, up 1.8 percent for the day, and was rising in late trading. The iPhone isn't just Apple's 'dominant product,' said Frank Gillett, a tech industry analyst at Forrester Research. 'It's more than anything else what's driving the success of their company.' Market researchers, however, expect growth in the world smartphone market will slow this year, particularly at the higher price range where Apple competes, as most consumers in developed countries have already bought one. That could make it difficult for Apple to maintain its recent pace. 'They're extremely dependent on the iPhone,' said investment Colin Gillis at BGC Partners. 'At some point, the market dynamics change,' he said, adding that 'the question is what could replace the iPhone' if sales begin to slow. Customers looking at Apple iPhones in an Apple store in Shanghai, China, on January 14, 2014. Apple CEO Tim Cook has said he's optimistic about new markets such as China, where Apple has made a strong showing against Samsung and China's Xiaomi. And even if Apple is increasingly selling new iPhones to people who are simply upgrading older models, 'that's still a pretty healthy market,' said Gartner analyst Van Baker, noting that more than 700 million iPhones have been sold since the first model was introduced in 2007. Maestri also stressed the potential for new products like Apple Watch and Apple Pay, the company's mobile payment service. While these currently provide minimal revenue, analysts say they have big potential. And they are designed to work closely with the iPhone, which means each may bolster the other's popularity in the future, Gillett said.","Apple sold more than 61 million iPhones in the quarter .

"Just like humans learning to talk, puppies can sometimes take a while to learn to bark. At least, that seemed to be the case for one young Shibu Inu, who caused hilarity with a somewhat chatty display at an American Kennel Club centre. The pup was filmed squeaking and squawking after meeting a young husky dog and attempting to bark at its new companion. Captured on video, the puppies are held in the air by their respective handlers and one of the dogs makes a high-pitched whining sound. Opening its mouth, the Shibu Inu then begins vocalising with a yappy bark before the husky – leaning back in its handler’s arm – whines. People standing by laugh and put their hands to their mouths as a staff member turns to address and pacify the dog. The puppy Shibu Inu and husky feature opposite one another while conversing at an American Kennel Club centre . Falling quiet for a second, the Shibu Inu pipes up once more – louder than before – causing the husky to respond. As the dogs continue to converse, the video maker asks with a giggle: ‘What is that noise?’ But it is barely audible over the sounds of the intense barking, whining and yapping. Later in the video the excited Shibu Inu begins running in its owner's arms in its attempts to get closer to the husky. Passers-by laugh and film the two dogs as they begin yapping, whining and barking at one another .

"Nicola Sturgeon will today launch an extraordinary bid to ‘lead the UK’ as she unveils a string of policies apparently tailor-made for a power-sharing deal with Labour. The SNP leader will unveil a manifesto including proposals for British foreign policy, welfare payments, energy bills and English university tuition fees. Several of her election pledges overlap with Labour policy, including slashing tuition fees in England from a maximum of £9,000 a year to £6,000, and rolling back competition in the English NHS. Others are calculated to drag a minority Labour government to the left, including halting the roll-out of Iain Duncan Smith’s popular changes to benefits and cancelling the Trident nuclear weapons system. Scroll down for video . Control: The Tories warn SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon will be Ed Miliband's puppet master if he becomes Prime Minister after the election . Several election pledges in Miss Sturgeon's manifesto overlap with Labour policy, including slashing tuition fees in England from a maximum of £9,000 a year to £6,000, and rolling back competition in the English NHS . The SNP also wants the UK to formally recognise Palestine as a state, give energy regulator Ofgem the power to force suppliers to cut prices and to increase public spending on infrastructure in northern England and Wales. At the heart of the SNP’s manifesto are plans for what Miss Sturgeon has called ‘modest’ spending increases funded by yet more borrowing – but which in fact total £180billion over five years. Scotland’s First Minister, who is not herself running for a Westminster seat, said yesterday the SNP had much in common with Left-wing Labour MPs and aimed to build a ‘progressive alliance’ for people ‘right across the UK’. ‘There is an opportunity to build progressive alliances for progressive policies. It is a real rather than a pretend alternative to austerity,’ she told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. Today’s SNP election manifesto will be the first to be the focus of intense national scrutiny. Polls suggest the party is on course for a landslide victory north of the border, winning as many as 50 seats and holding the balance of power at Westminster. That could trigger constitutional turmoil of the sort that followed the 1910 election, when Irish Nationalists surged and ended up with more than 70 seats. In the years that followed, there was bitter conflict and the larger part of Ireland eventually seceded from the UK. The huge surge in support for the SNP could see senior Labour figures such as Jim Murphy (left) and Douglas Alexander (right) lose their seats . The latest Scotland-wide YouGov survey shows the SNP on a record 49 per cent, up three, with Labour trailing on 25 per cent, down four. The Conservatives were on 18 per cent and Liberal Democrats on just four per cent. The scale of the shift in traditional Labour strongholds in Scotland is unprecedented in modern European politics. Even senior Labour figures, including the Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy and the shadow foreign secretary and the party’s election campaign coordinator, Douglas Alexander, are facing defeat. The SNP will declare today that a ‘strong team’ of SNP MPs in Westminster would help ‘rebalance the UK - both politically and economically - from the chronic over-dominance of the City of London, which has harmed the overall UK economy and left regions of England neglected’. Miss Sturgeon insisted those who had asked Scotland to remain in the UK in last year’s independence referendum could not now object to it calling the shots at Westminster. ‘We were told by leaders of the No campaign during the closing stages of the referendum debate that Scotland’s voice really mattered. Indeed, we were told that Scotland shouldn’t leave the UK but lead the UK,’ she said. ‘So it is more than a bit rich, now that Scotland has decided to remain part of the Westminster system, for anyone in London or elsewhere to try and imply that Scotland’s voice shouldn’t be heard or that Scotland’s voice somehow becomes an illegitimate one if people here decide to elect a large number of SNP MPs.’ However, the First Minister will face tough questions at today’s launch over her plans for ‘full fiscal autonomy’ or effective ‘home rule’, which would see almost every power apart from foreign affairs and defence devolved to Holyrood. It would end the generous Barnett Formula that funds Scotland. The Institute for Fiscal Studies  has predicted that a ‘fiscally autonomous’ Scotland would have a £7.6billion black hole in its finances.",Nicola Sturgeon will today unveil SNP manifesto as a 'bid to lead the UK' Several of her party's election pledges will overlap with Labour policies .

"Muslim women should be allowed to wear a full-face veil while appearing in court, Britain's most senior judge has suggested. Lord Neuberger, the President of the Supreme Court, said judges and courtrooms should allow women to wear the traditional dress as they should 'show, and be seen to show' respect towards different customs. He said judges should be 'sensitive' to the fact that they usually came from 'more privileged sector of society' than many of those facing them and they should have an understanding of the 'different cultural and social habits'. Lord Neuberger said Britain's privileged judges must be aware of their 'subconscious bias' when dealing with poorer members of society . His address to the Criminal Justice Alliance came at a time of uncertainty over the place of Muslim traditional dress in the legal system. Following a controversial trial in 2003 of a Muslim woman accused of witness intimidation, Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas said there was a need for clear guidance on the issue. Rebekah Dawson refused to give evidence after being told she had to remove her face veil to let the jury see her face while testifying. The 22-year-old was later sentenced to six months in prison at Blackfriars Crown Court after changing her plea. Rebekah Dawson refused to give evidence after being told she had to remove her face veil to let the jury see her face while testifying. Here she pictured during her court hearing . Last year, the European Court of Human Rights upheld a ban by France on wearing the Muslim full-face veil, the niqab. A case was brought by a 24-year-old French woman, who argued that the ban on wearing the veil in public violated her freedom of religion and expression. In Lord Neuberger's address, he said judges and lawyers often failed to recognise how 'artificial and intimidating' courts could be for ordinary people. He said: 'I sometimes wonder whether our trial procedures really are the best way of getting at the truth. 'Would you feel that you had given of your best if you had been forced to give evidence in unfamiliar surroundings, with lots of strangers watching, in an intimidating court, with lawyers in funny clothes asking questions, often aggressively and trying to catch you out, and with no ability to tell the story as you remember it?' Dawson was later sentenced to six months in prison at Blackfriars Crown Court (pictured) He said this did not mean a call for a major overhaul of court proceedings but said judges, lawyers and court staff must do as much as possible to help people feel at ease in court. He continued: 'Judges have to show, and have to be seen to show, respect to everybody equally, and that requires an understanding of different cultural and social habits. 'It is necessary to have some understanding as to how people from different cultural, social, religious or other backgrounds think and behave and how they expect others to behave. 'Well known examples include how some religions consider it inappropriate to take the oath, how some people consider it rude to look other people in the eye, how some women find it inappropriate to appear in public with their face uncovered, and how some people deem it inappropriate to confront others or to be confronted – for instance with an outright denial. Lord Neuberger also suggested Muslim women should be allowed to wear a full face veil while appearing in court . 'More broadly, judges should be courteous and, generally, good-humoured; and, while they should be firm, they should never, however great the temptation, lose their temper.' The judge made the comments a week ago during an address to the Criminal Justice Alliance, in which he spoke of modern aspects of the British legal system. In a lengthy speech entitled 'Fairness in the courts: the best we can do', Lord Neuberger also said judges and lawyers should always keep in mind how 'intimidating' the court process can be for those involved in trials, including 'the parties, their families, the victims, the witnesses and the jurors'. Speaking in the context of legal aid cuts, he said the importance of ensuring all parties involved in a case understand the goings-on in a court is now greater because 'people are having to choose between representing themselves or not getting justice at all'. He also said: 'Judges may not appear to be neutral because they will almost always be seen, normally rightly, to come from a more privileged sector of society, in both economic and educational terms, compared with many of the parties, witnesses, jurors in court. 'A white male public school judge presiding in a trial of an unemployed traveller from Eastern Europe accused of assaulting or robbing a white female public school woman will, I hope, always be unbiased. 'However, he should always think to himself what his subconscious may be thinking or how it may be causing him to act.' Keith Porteous Wood, Executive Director of the National Secular Society, told the Daily Telegraph: 'Lord Neuberger understandably recommends judges understand the expectations of how those 'from different cultural, social, religious or other backgrounds think and behave and how they expect others to behave' and that the judiciary should show 'respect to everybody equally'. 'It was a missed opportunity, however, not to acknowledge that occasionally – for example on a defendant wearing a full face veil – doing so might conflict with justice being seen to be done, or even justice being done. 'My concern is not theoretical; it is now 18 months since a judge at Blackfriars Magistrate Court wasted a great deal of court time dealing with the question of full-face veils, and made a heartfelt plea for central guidance to avoid this inefficient use of expensive court's resources being replicated elsewhere. 'The Lord Chief Justice's office has been dealing with this for a long time but seems disappointingly reluctant to issue any direction.'","Lord Neuberger said Muslim women should be allowed to wear a full-face veil when appearing in court to show respect to 'different customs . He also said judges must be aware of their 'subconscious bias' Judges are 'rightly' seen as from 'privileged' part of society, he said . He cited a judge ruling on a case of an unemployed traveller as an example .

In March 2013, he was taken to University College Hospital in London after suffering a the stroke, also known as a transient ischaemic attack. Despite his age, the Duke still undertakes a large number of royal engagements. He became the Duke of Kent at just six when his father died in a wartime flying accident in 1942. The Duke is the son of Prince George, the younger brother of King George VI and King Edward VIII.

"These extraordinary pictures show more than 1,700 Chinese students taking an exam in their high school's playground - because they could not all fit inside. The freshmen students from Yichuan, Shaanxi province took the exam on Saturday in the first attempt by the school to allow pupils to sit exams in the open. The school said the reason behind the unusual move was the lack of sufficient indoor space - and added that it could be a test of the students' organizing capacity, the People's Daily Online reported. The paper reported that the Grade One students at Yichuan Senior High School suggested and organised the outdoor exam themselves. The students thought of everything and in order to avoid being dazzled by the sunshine, which may have caused them to feel dizzy, a regular radio announcement ordered pupils to turn their chairs and desks collectively from time to time. The newspaper reported that many of the students believe sitting the exam outside is a novel way to broaden their horizons and encourage them to feel more relaxed. Some of the students also suggested it could help to prevent cheating. 'Grade One students suggested they organise the exam in such a way,' said one unnamed teacher.

"Ed Miliband will do 'more damage to the country than he did to his brother', Boris Johnson said this morning as the pair clashed on live TV. The London Mayor, who appeared alongside Mr Miliband on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, launched a furious personal assault on his rival - with their encounter descending into a furious shouting match. But Mr Miliband, who beat his elder brother David to the Labour leadership in 2010, ended up laughing off the attack, responding: 'Come on Boris, you're better than that.' Animated: Boris Johnson wags a finger at Miliband, who appears to have a clenched fist, on the Andrew Marr Show this morning. The rivals' encounter quickly descended into a slanging match . No let-up: The Tory and Labour politicians go at it hammer and tongs in front of their TV audience . The heated exchange ends with presenter Andrew Marr (right) injecting and the men trying to laugh about it . Mr Johnson's verbal mauling of the Labour leader comes after the Tories were accused of 'descending into the gutter' for claiming that Mr Miliband may 'stab the country in the back' by doing a deal with the SNP to get into power. But today, Mr Johnson insisted that Labour could not take power without the support of the SNP, and claimed the prospect was 'actually deeply alarming'. He said Mr Miliband would have to take help from the Scottish party 'crouching on his back like a monkey' - making it impossible for him to govern in the interests of the whole UK. The London Mayor added: I am not saying that your brother had to present himself at A&E with a dagger in his back... [but] he [Ed Miliband] would do more damage to this country than he did to his brother, and that is the key point.' Verbal onslaught: Mr Johnson said that Labour could not take power without the support of the SNP . Time to go: Mr Johnson and Mr Miliband leave the politics programme after their massive on-air argument . Mr Miliband arrived at the BBC studios in Central London by car, while Mr Johnson cycled there . Ed Miliband won the Labour leadership in September 2010 by narrowly beating his brother David, who had been the runaway favourite for the top job. The younger sibling won the ballot by just over 1 per cent after the second, third and fourth preference votes came into play. David had garnered the majority of support from Labour MPs and party members - but Ed was ahead with the trade-union members. He hugged David after the result was announced - but later admitted the decision to stand against him caused deep division between the brothers. David stayed on as an MP until 2013, then announced he was quitting Parliament to become head of the giant New York-based charity International Rescue Committee. Mr Miliband hit out at the Conservatives for their campaign, saying: 'They are so desperate they are reduced to trying to set one part of the country against another.' Mr Johnson insisted the Conservative attacks on the SNP were not risking the union. 'I'm so proud and so positive about what's happening in this country at the moment, and I just think there are unnecessary risks involved in this Labour-SNP condominium,' he said. 'So the answer would be, no I don't think we are in any way imperiling the union. The people who would imperil the union, because that's what their party is called, is the Scottish Nationalist Party. 'And I imagine their strategy - like the parable, or the fable, of the frog and the scorpion - is to be allowed to be carried across the river and then ultimately to sting... [he is cut off]' The Conservatives have made the prospect of a Labour administration that's reliant on SNP votes one of the central planks of their election campaign in the last fortnight. But Mr Miliband has repeatedly insisted that he will not make any 'deals' with the SNP to become Prime Minister. And he told Andrew Marr today: 'No coalition, no tie-ins, I have said no deals - I have been clear about that. I am not doing deals with the Scottish Nationalist Party.' Asked explicitly whether he was ruling out a confidence-and-supply agreement, he replied: 'No deals.' Ed Miliband and Boris Johnson livened up the election campaign this morning when they went head-to-head on live TV. After being interviewed separately by presenter Andrew Marr, the pair of would-be Prime Ministers were brought together to challenge each other directly. Mr Miliband kicked off the heated exchange by demanding to know if Mr Johnson backed rules that allow wealthy foreigners living in Britain to avoid tax on their overseas earnings. He said: ‘Are you for keeping non-dom status? You’re defending those people who come here, they live here for 30 years, they are permanently here and they don’t pay taxes here.’ Mr Johnson responded: ‘Hang on, is this the Ed Miliband who was in the Treasury with Gordon Brown for about ten years? Are you the same creature? I mean, is there some sort of doppelganger going on?’ The Labour leader hit back, saying: ‘Don’t get rattled, come on now. Andrew Marr interjected to ask the London Mayor to defend inflammatory remarks in which he had accused Mr Miliband of being a back stabber. He said: ‘You attacked Ed Miliband very forcibly today, Boris, for backstabbing. Do you really think that is a fair approach to somebody who is standing in an election? Before Mr Johnson could speak, Mr Miliband said: ‘He doesn’t believe it. Come on, Boris, you are better than that.’ But the London Mayor replied: ‘I am not saying that your brother had to present himself at A&E with a dagger in his back. But he would do more damage to this country than to his brother - and that is the key point.’","London Mayor appeared with Mr Miliband on BBC1's Andrew Marr Show .

"Jeremy Clarkson has finally spoken out about his high-profile sacking from Top Gear, admitting he will 'miss' fronting the BBC2 show. Clarkson, 54, who was fired in March after attacking a producer during filming, has not publicly addressed his dismissal, apart from to say that 'everyone's upset'. But the presenter today gave his 'heartfelt thanks' to those who sent their support in the aftermath of his sacking, saying he would 'miss being there'. It came as Ms Rippon, 70, who first presented the show 38 years ago, said she would be keen to return to the motoring show if she were invited back. Scroll down for video . Jeremy Clarkson (left) today revealed he would 'miss' fronting Top Gear, as it emerged that former presenter Angela Rippon (right) would be keen to return to the motoring show . Ms Rippon, 70, who first presented the show 38 years ago, said it would be 'great' if she were invited back to front Top Gear . Writing in The Sun, Clarkson said: 'Heartfelt thanks to all those who have written to say how much they will miss me on Top Gear. It's not as much, however, as I'll miss being there.' Clarkson was dropped by the BBC after an internal investigation found he had launched an 'unprovoked' 30-second physical attack on producer Oisin Tymon because he was offered a plate of cold cuts instead of steak and chips. The presenter was found to have split the producer's lip and verbally abused him. Following weeks of speculation over the star's future, Lord Hall, the director-general of the corporation, publicly announced  that the BBC would not be renewing Clarkson's contract. He said Clarkson had 'crossed the line' and that 'there cannot be one rule for one and one rule for another'. Now, with the future of the show still up in the air, former newsreader Ms Rippon said it would be 'great' if she was invited back. Clarkson, who was dropped by the BBC after launching an 'unprovoked' 30-second physical attack on producer Oisin Tymon. today gave his 'heartfelt thanks' to those who have supported him . She told The Daily Mirror: 'It would be great if they said ""let's get the old girl back to do the odd film for us"". What I did all those years ago is totally different to what they do now. 'If a programme is going to have longevity, which Top Gear has, it has to keep evolving.' She added that there should be a woman included in the team - because half the drivers on the road are female. Jodie Kidd, the former model, has already been linked to the show. It also emerged last month that DIY SOS star Nick Knowles could become the new Top Gear presenter because the BBC believe he is a 'safe pair of hands'. Meanwhile, BBC bosses are said to be desperately trying to hold onto James May (left) and Richard Hammond (right) - Clarkson's co-presenters - for the BBC2 show . Mr May has previously said that the trio 'came as a package', while Hammond - not ruling out a return - said the sacking marked 'the end of an era' But BBC bosses are reportedly still trying to persuade Richard Hammond and James May to continue with the show, in a bid to cling onto long-term fans. Although May, 52, and Hammond, 45, have both hinted separately that they do not see a future with Top Gear, both have remained silent on the issue for the past few weeks. A source told the Daily Mirror: 'Richard is a TV presenter and this could be his chance to become top dog - he's been on the show a bit longer than James. That is a big opportunity to pass over.' They added: 'It would be a great shame to lose all the talent in one go - re-booting it from scratch would be a far harder task than replacing one.' Mr May has previously said that the trio 'came as a package', while Hammond - not ruling out a return - said the sacking marked 'the end of an era'. But little has been said since the initial reaction to the sacking. Some believe the presenters are remaining silent while waiting for bids from rival channels, which may want to sign up the group as a trio. All three were on the cusp of signing new three-year deals when the Clarkson fracas unfolded. Some believe the pair are remaining silent while waiting for bids from rival channels, which may want to snap up the former Top Gear group as a trio . The day after Clarkson's sacking, May gave a big hint that he has no plans to return to Top Gear, suggesting he is to ‘go back to normal life.’ The presenter admitted he was already considering what to do next with his life - and suggested he might even ditch cars to become a teacher. He said: 'I might want to do something completely different with my life, I'm quite old now. (I might do) something outside of cars, I always wanted to be a teacher.' He also seemed to confirm speculation that he would leave the top-rating programme, saying: 'We always knew it wasn't going to last forever'. Clarkson, 54, was sacked after attacking Oisin Tymon in an episode which Lord Hall said had 'crossed the line' But the BBC's creative director Alan Yentob previously made it clear he wanted May and Hammond to continue presenting the show without Clarkson, despite acknowledging it would be 'perfectly natural' for them to have reservations about continuing. He said: 'It's perfectly natural for them. They are a team they have worked together for a very long time, they are all very attached. 'If Jeremy is not in it and Richard and James are, that needs to be a conversation with them as well. They need to be happy about what's going on and where they think the programme needs to be.' May fronts several other TV programmes, including the popular James May's Toy Stories, James May's Man Lab and Oz and James' Big Wine Adventure with wine expert Oz Clarke. Hammond has a successful career as a children’s television host, fronting the second series of National Geographic's Science of Stupid.

"(CNN)Giovanni Lo Porto put himself in harm's way to help, heading to Pakistan to work on a much needed reconstruction project following deadly flooding there. His work and his life, as he knew it then, came to a halt on January 19, 2012. That's when, according to Italy's state-run ANSA news agency, four armed men burst into the building where Lo Porto lived and abducted him along with colleague Bernd Muehlenbeck. Two years later, Lo Porto was dead -- killed accidentally by a U.S. drone strike, according to American authorities. The native of the Sicilian city of Palermo died along with a fellow al Qaeda hostage, American Warren Weinstein. That same counterterrorism operation in a border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan killed at least one al Qaeda leader, Ahmed Farouq, who was also a U.S. citizen. His family members, including his four brothers, called him Giancarlo. Lo Porto grew up in Sicily and then studied at London Metropolitan University, getting his undergraduate degree there in Peace and Conflict Studies in 2010, according to the school. A professor there remembers him as ""passionate, friendly (and) open-minded,"" according to an ANSA report. And the university, in a statement, described him as ""a popular student who was committed to helping others."" ""We are tremendously proud of him and the humanitarian work he did,"" the school said. At the time he was taken captive, Lo Porto worked with the German aid organization Welthungerlife, a 53-year-old group dedicated to fighting hunger and poverty worldwide. Such work means going to places where the need is most -- places like Multan in Pakistan. That community was one of many in Pakistan devastated by major flooding in 2010, which covered about one-fifth of the country and left more than 1,500 people dead. These conditions are all too common in the South Asian nation, as evidenced by flooding one year later that forced upwards of 660,000 into refugee camps and killed more than 430 people, about a quarter of whom were children. ""He told me, 'I'm pleased to have returned to Asia and Pakistan, I love the people, culture and food in this part of the world,' "" said the London Metropolitan University professor. Specifically, Lo Porto was a project manager with Welthungerlife's clean water and sanitation program, working with 8 to 10 fellow international staffers and 100 to 200 locals starting in October 2011, according to Simone Pott, a spokeswoman for the aid group. Pott described Lo Porto as a lively, very positive man who made friends all over the world. Some of those friends in Italy, England and beyond pressed for Lo Porto's release after he was taken captive, urging Italy's government and newspaper editors to get his story out, ANSA reported. The same story said that al Qaeda (after first claiming he was being held) denied abducting Lo Porto, as did the Pakistani Taliban. Muehlenbeck, a German national, was freed last October, at which time he said that he and his colleague had been separated, according to ANSA. But Lo Porto never got the chance to savor freedom again, like his German counterpart. Italian Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni said his country's government ""carried out every effort possible to trace and try to return Giovanni to his loved ones."" ""Unfortunately, the conclusion is now different (than we wanted) because of the tragic and fatal mistake of our American allies, which has been recognized by President Obama,"" Gentiloni said. ""The responsibility of his death and (that) of Warren Weinstein ... is that of the terrorists."" On Thursday, after the U.S. government reported Lo Porto's death, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi expressed his ""deepest sorrow for the death of an Italian who dedicated his life to the service of others."" Lo Porto's death left those at his former charity Welthungerlife speechless and confused, Pott said. And then there are his family members like his mother, who ANSA reports became ""another person"" after her son's kidnapping. ""Her only hope was to embrace Giovanni,"" a neighbor said. CNN's Hadia Messia contributed to this report.","NGO where Lo Porto works describes him as a lively, positive man with lots of friends . London university  says he was a ""popular student ... committed to helping others"" He was killed in a U.S. counterterrorism strike in January, authorities say .",5e2c79c2d54b0e6bc5d28545765bc9585d0c0224
"(CNN)He might have just won one of sport's most prestigious events, but it wasn't long before Jordan Spieth's thoughts turned to his autistic sister in the glow of victory. The 21-year-old golfer equaled Tiger Woods' 1997 record winning score of 18 under par to realize his childhood ambitions of donning the green jacket on Sunday as he swept through the field to become Masters champion at Augusta. An ice-cool display made him the second-youngest winner -- behind only Woods, who was 155 days younger that year -- and only the fifth man to have led from start to finish over the tournament's four days. ""I miss her a lot, and I wish she could have been here,"" Spieth told CNN's Don Riddell in the aftermath of his triumph as he opened up about younger sibling Ellie, who was not able to attend the tournament. ""But I can't wait to get back to her and maybe let her try on the jacket. ""I'll have to bring her back a present from here. That's what she'll be expecting."" Amid all the pressure of playing professional golf, Spieth's 14-year-old sister provides him with perspective. ""How has she shaped my upbringing? Well, she's the most special part of our family. She's the funniest part of our family,"" he said. ""I love having her around. She's an incredible sister, my biggest supporter. She is somebody who you can watch and then reflect on the big picture of life and understand that all these frustrations in a day, or in a round of golf, are really secondary. ""We wouldn't have that realization without her."" At the age of just 14, the prodigy from Texas -- who was named after basketball legend Michael Jordan -- had been clear about what he wanted: his aim was to take the Masters title one day. And he betrayed virtually no sign of nerves throughout his stunningly dominant performance, letting slip only a muttered ""oh dear"" when he marginally sliced a tee shot halfway through the final round. Last year, Spieth lost the lead just before the nine-hole turn on the last day -- but he never looked like being denied this time, beating Phil Mickelson's Masters record of 26 birdies for good measure. ""To sit with this jacket on and to be a part of the history of Augusta National and the Masters was something I watched slip away last year,"" said Spieth, who described the reality of winning as ""even better"" than his dreams. ""I had a chip on my shoulder (about that). I carried some momentum into this week and it all came together, right at the right time."" Shown a picture of himself wearing one of the most coveted pieces of clothing in sport, Spieth, born in Dallas, added: ""Putting on the jacket, it looks good. It looks good. I'm OK wearing green!"" He couldn't stop grinning as he said that he hoped to be finishing his final Masters appearance in 50 years' time, but added that he would ""still remember what it was like walking up the 18th hole today."" And as he looked less far ahead, he revealed that he would be staying true to his roots at next year's Champions Dinner. Asked what he would put on the menu for that event, he said: ""It would be some form of Texas BBQ."" The unassuming Spieth's success brings to mind other stars whose supreme ability and self-belief saw them become major champions in the early days of their careers. In 1985, German tennis player Boris Becker stunned Wimbledon when, at the age of 17, he defeated Kevin Curren to become the event's youngest ever men's champion -- a record that still stands today. Becker said people ""thought I had done something I wasn't supposed to do, something that shouldn't have been possible. But I did it -- and then I did it again at 18, just to make the point."" American player Michael Chang was 118 days younger than Becker when he won the French Open in 1989, while Swiss star Martina Hingis was just 16 when she triumphed at the 1997 Australian Open. Last year, at the age of only 15, Martin Odegaard became Norway's youngest international footballer when he played in a friendly against the United Arab Emirates, provoking huge media interest and the attention of Europe's top clubs, before he signed for Spanish giant Real Madrid. For them, as for Spieth, perhaps success was meant to be from the earliest days. And as he looked at a picture of himself with a golf club in hand, taken at the age of 6 or 7 at his grandparents' home in North Carolina, he reflected on the determination that had put him in the green jacket, referring to another Major winner. ""How about the focus on that swing?"" he asked. ""That's a little John Daly-like there, isn't it?""",Jordan Spieth hails autistic younger sibling as his biggest supporter . Ice-cool display made him second-youngest winner behind Tiger Woods .,a660a979787f5e5c9abe501a4f85867fb681f212

"Arsene Wenger insists his woeful record against Jose Mourinho will have no bearing on Arsenal's top-of-the-table clash with Chelsea at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday. Wenger has failed to win in 12 games against Mourinho across the Portuguese coach's two spells at Stamford Bridge, drawing five and losing seven of their clashes. But the Arsenal manager says the past shared between the two managers on the touchline in Sunday's 4pm kick-off will be irrelevant as the Barclays Premier League's top two sides face off. Arsene Wenger has drawn five and lost seven of his 12 clashes with Jose Mourinho ahead of facing Chelsea . Wenger and Mourinho rowed on the touchline in October's 2-0 win for Chelsea in the reverse fixture . 'I think we have not always lost in 12 attempts. We have been close,' Wenger said. 'Having said that, the result on Sunday will just be down to the performance on the day. We are on a good run and we have an opportunity at home to beat them and we want to take it. 'We have a good run of form and good belief and solidarity. We have passed many tests recently when we were questioned. We have another test on Sunday that we want to pass. 'Chelsea's strengths are they have been very efficient on counter attacks and set-pieces as well. We have to nullify their strengths.' Asked about his frosty relationship with Mourinho, Wenger said: 'I do not want to talk about that. What is interesting for people is when the game starts at 4pm we have a great game. It is not about the relationship between the managers.' The managers of London's two biggest clubs have long had a frosty relationship in the opposing dugouts . Cesc Fabregas set up Diego Costa to seal a 2-0 victory for Chelsea against Arsenal earlier this season . Arsenal are 10 points behind Chelsea but come into the game on the back of excellent form. Wenger said: 'Look, mathematically it will be possible, yes, but Chelsea has their future and the championship in their hands. We can get closer and we have an opportunity to do that at home and want to take it.' Wenger added: 'They have been very consistent until now. They have fewer losses than any team. The Premier League rewards consistency. On that front they gave been defensively very strong and consistent.' Fabregas gets ahead of his now-team-mate Branislav Ivanovic to score against Chelsea for Arsenal in 2010 . Sunday's game marks the return of former Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas, who will be wearing Chelsea blue at the Emirates for the first time. Fabregas left for Barcelona in 2011. Arsenal supporters are expected to give their former hero a hot reception after he joined their fierce rivals, but Wenger has asked for some respect for one of their best players of the last decade. 'I want every player to be respected, and Cesc Fabregas when he comes to the Emirates on Sunday to be respected like he deserves,' he said. Asked if he regretted not signing Fabregas in the summer when he had the option to, Wenger added: 'The regret I have is that he wanted to leave here. 'This club and myself had a very positive influence on Cesc’s life, so I would be a bit uncomfortable to have to justify today why he is not here. I believe I would rather it was the other way around.' Wenger is without Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Mikel Arteta on Sunday, while Per Mertesacker is rated as '50-50' by his manager having not trained at all this week.

"Yaya Toure will not be forced out of Manchester City, but the club are set to make the midfielder available this summer. Sportsmail revealed earlier this week that the Barclays Premier League champions will listen to offers for the Ivorian as they look to reshape their squad after a disappointing season. But Toure will fight for his City career this summer despite the club pondering his future. Yaya Toure will not be forced out of Manchester City, but the club are set to make him available this summer . Sportsmail revealed earlier this week that the  Premier League champions will listen to offers for the Ivorian . He is said to be content with life at the Etihad Stadium despite the difficulties and is in no rush to leave. The Ivorian has played a major role during City's recent trophy-laden period, helping the club to two Premier League titles, an FA Cup and League Cup since joining from Barcelona in 2010. And the powerhouse midfielder still believes he can have a major impact for City in the future and remains fully committed to the cause. Another stumbling block towards a potential move is the four-time African Player of the Year winner's wages. Inter Milan, managed by Roberto Mancini, are interested but given his huge wages there are some doubts . Toure has more than two years left on his current £220,000-a-week deal and is unlikely to move for anything less. A number of clubs, such as Inter Milan, are interested in the 31-year-old, but given his huge salary there must be doubts over whether they would be able to afford it. Inter are prepared to offer Toure a five-year deal to compensate for the pay-cut he would be required to take if he moved to Italy — although, it remains to be seen whether he'd agree to such a compromise. There have been preliminary talks about a contract extension for Toure at City — which included the possibility of an ambassadorial role when he hangs up his boots. But it seems the club are now happy for him to leave. City, meanwhile, will resist any attempt by Valencia to pull out of a £24million deal for Alvaro Negredo to fund a move for Radamel Falcao, currently on loan at Manchester United. City will resist any attempt by Valencia to pull out of a £24million deal for Alvaro Negredo this summer . Negredo joined Valencia on loan last summer and the agreement included a clause involving a permanent move to the Mestalla. Reports in Spain  suggested that Valencia are having second thoughts about keeping Negredo next season, but City are adamant that the deal will go through as planned. The 29-year-old striker scored 23 goals in his first season at the Etihad following a £20.6m move from Sevilla, but he has only found the net five times for Valencia. When he scored in Monday’s 3-0 win over Levante, the Spain striker refused to celebrate, fuelling speculation over his future at the club. Negredo joined Valencia on loan last summer but reports in Spain say they are looking at Radamel Falcao . Victory kept Valencia in fourth place in La Liga and on course to qualify for the Champions League, but financial problems mean they are already struggling to hold onto key players like defender Nicolas Otamendi. It has, however, not stopped Valencia being linked with a summer move for Falcao, who is set to leave United at the end of his season-long loan from Monaco. Falcao’s agent Jorge Mendes has been acting as an advisor to Valencia owner Peter Lim and offloading Negredo is seen as one way of affording the Colombia star. City had scouts at Porto, watching their 3-1 Champions League win over Bayern Munich on Wednesday night, with the home team’s Brazilian left-back Alex Sandro said to be the main focus of interest.

"The majority of people taking antidepressants may not actually have depression, a new study claims. Researchers discovered more than two-thirds (69 per cent) of people taking antidepressants did not meet the criteria for major depressive disorder, which is also known as clinical depression. Antidepressants are also prescribed for other psychiatric disorders. But the researchers found 38 per cent of those taking the drugs did not meet the criteria for obsessive compulsive disorder, panic disorder, social phobia or generalised anxiety disorder either. Scroll down for video . More than two thirds of people taking antidepressants did not meet the criteria for clinical depression . The U.S. investigators looked at those taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), the most commonly prescribed type of anti-depressant. SSRIs are usually the first choice medication for depression and other psychiatric conditions because they generally have fewer side effects than most other types of antidepressant. Writing in the report,  published in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, the researchers concluded: ‘Many individuals prescribed antidepressants may not have met the criteria for mental disorders. ‘Our data indicates that antidepressants are commonly used in the absence of clear evidence-based indications.’ Commenting on the study, Dr Howard Forman, medical director of the Addiction Consultation Service at Montefiore Medical Center, said clinical depression is distinct from temporary feelings of sadness. He told Medical Daily: 'We all experience periods of stress, periods of sadness, and periods of self-doubt. 'These don’t make us mentally ill, they define us as human.' In the U.S., official guidelines say clinical depression should be diagnosed if a person has five or more depressive symptoms over a two week period, most of the day, nearly every day. The symptoms include a depressed mood; a loss of interested or pleasure in activities; weight loss, weight gain or changes in appetite; insomnia or increased desire to sleep.

Other symptoms included restlessness or slowed behaviour; fatigue or loss of energy; feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt; difficulty making decisions or trouble concentrating, and thoughts of death or suicide. Prescriptions for anti-depressants have more than trebled since 1998 in the world’s richest countries, a study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development found. The research noted a particular rise in in the use of SSRIs like Prozac and Seroxat. The OECD figures showed Iceland to have the highest prescribing rate, at 106 doses a day for every 1,000 inhabitants in 2011, up from 71 a decade earlier. Behind Iceland is Australia, then Canada, Denmark, Sweden and Portugal. The lowest levels were seen in Chile and South Korea. Separate data from the US shows 11 per cent of Americans over 12-years-old use anti-depressants. As part of the new study, doctors used data from the Baltimore Epidemiologic Catchment Area (ECA) Study Wave 1, which began in 1981, up to Wave 4, which ended in 2005. In total, they used data on 1,071 participants, carrying out four interviews and assessing the use of antidepressants. They found 13 per cent of people in the group reported using antidepressants. The study found 38 per cent of SSRI users did not meet the criteria for obsessive compulsive disorder, panic disorder, social phobia or generalized anxiety disorder or clinical depression (file photo) It's thought that SSRIs work by increasing the levels of a chemical called serotonin in the brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter (a messenger chemical that carries signals between nerve cells in the brain). It's thought to have a good influence on mood, emotion and sleep. After carrying a message, serotonin is usually reabsorbed by the nerve cells (known as 'reuptake'). SSRIs work by blocking ('inhibiting') reuptake, meaning more serotonin is available to pass further messages between nearby nerve cells. The NHS Choices website while it would be too simplistic to say that depression and related mental health conditions are caused by low serotonin levels, a rise in serotonin levels can improve symptoms and make people more responsive to other types of treatment. Source: NHS Choices . They then assessed whether the people in this group met the criteria for a mental disorder, as laid out in the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the U.S. bible for psychiatric conditions. They found that 38 per cent of SSRI users did not meet the criteria for a mental disorder, and 69 per cent did not meet the criteria for major depressive disorder. The news comes after a study found women who take antidepressants during pregnancy are more likely to have a baby with autism. The U.S. study supports previous research which has shown that taking SSRI antidepressants during pregnancy increases a woman’s risk of having a child with the developmental disability. And other American research revealed young adults taking high-dose antidepressants such as Prozac and Seroxat have double the risk of suicidal behaviour. Researchers pointed to previous studies, which found antidepressant drugs are linked with an increased risk of suicidal behaviour and thoughts in children and adolescents, particularly in the early stages of treatment.",Study analysed those taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) Found 69% did not meet the criteria for clinical depression .

"Lionel Messi is not the best player in the world, neither is Cristiano Ronaldo - that title belongs to Paris Saint-Germain forward Javier Pastore, according to Eric Cantona. Making a rare foray into discussing football matters, Manchester United legend Cantona delivered his surprising verdict that the Argentine was the ‘most creative’ player in the world. ‘The best player in the world, the most exciting player in the world, is [Javier] Pastore from Paris Saint-Germain,’ said Cantona, ‘Why? Because I watched two games just to see Pastore playing, giving passes. He has got something special. Because football is interactive, it's why football is so popular, I think.’ Javier Pastore (right) celebrates after winning the French League Cup with PSG last Saturday . The Argentina international is the best player in the world, according to former striker Eric Cantona . The former Manchester United forward was speaking at the Laureus World Sports Awards in Shanghai . Pastore, who cost the French league leaders £29million, has three goals and five assists this season compared with Messi’s 45 goals for Barcelona and Cristiano Ronaldo’s 51 for Spanish rivals Real Madrid. But statistics did not colour Cantona’s assessment. ‘Pastore can do things that the other ones don't know, he does things that surprise you every time. Not only in scoring goals, spectacular goals - everything. Just passing. He's a very creative player. He's the most creative player, I think, in the world today. It's why I think he's the best player in the world, because I love this kind of player.’ Cantona was third in the Ballon d’Or in 1993 behind Roberto Baggio and Dennis Bergkamp. He won the Premier League four times with United before retiring from playing aged 30. No stranger to prompting debate, Cantona invited more controversy by suggesting Spain had only won the World Cup because of the influence of Barcelona on the national team. Cristiano Ronaldo was crowned the best player in the world for 2014 at the award ceremony in January . The Real Madrid forward has scored 51 goals in all competitions this season . Barcelona forward Lionel Messi has also been overlooked by Cantona despite netting 45 times this season . ‘Catalonia won the World Cup,’ said Cantona, speaking at the Laureus World Sports Awards in Shanghai. ‘Spain won it with 10 Barcelona players in the team. Spain did not win the World Cup, Catalonia did. Barcelona won it. ‘My grandparents are from Catalunya, from Barcelona. They arrived in France in '39. There was a civil war. So, I am very proud of Barcelona and all that they have done. ‘I’m sure that as soon as the youth set-up from Barcelona and other Spanish teams draw new, good players, Spain will emerge again.’",Eric Cantona says PSG midfielder Javier Pastore is world's best player .

"Men with advanced prostate cancer could benefit from a pioneering drug originally meant for women. Clinical trials show that olaparib can delay the moment when the disease gets dangerously out of control. The drug already works for women with cancer fuelled by BRCA gene mutations, the defect that led to actress Angelina Jolie having her ovaries removed. New ‘exciting’ new research suggests the drug, already used to treat women with breast cancer, could also help men with genetic faults within their prostate cancer (pictured) tumours . Up to 30 per cent of men with advanced prostate cancer have tumours that have DNA defects and these respond particularly well to olaparib. The London trial of olaparib, which is owned by AstraZeneca, was led by researchers at the Institute of Cancer Research and the Royal Marsden hospital. They found 16 out of 49 men with advanced prostate cancer responded to the drug, also known as Lynparza. It stopped prostate cancer growth, generating lower tumour cell counts in the blood and improved responses in medical scans. The drug - called olaparib - can extend the length of time that a prostate cancer patient lives with the disease without it getting worse, according to new clinical trials. Olaparib is the first cancer drug to target inherited genetic mutations. It is one of the first of a new class of drugs called PARP inhibitors. PARP inhibitors work by blocking the cancer cell’s ability to repair damage. Cancer cells that have a mutation in a BRCA gene rely completely on the PARP protein to fix the damage. PARP inhibitor drugs suppress this protein and can stop BRCA mutated cells from growing so they eventually die. Side effects from traditional anti-cancer treatments are reduced because only cancer cells with genetic defects are targeted. Most of the men who had detectable DNA repair mutations had disease control lasting much longer than expected. This suggests the men most likely to benefit from the drug could be identified by testing to look for mutations. Olaparib became the first of a new class of drugs called PARP inhibitors to be granted approval last month for use in ovarian cancer by the European Commission and the US Food and Drug Administration. The inhibitors work by blocking the cancer cell’s ability to repair damage. Cancer cells that have a mutation in a BRCA gene rely completely on the PARP protein to fix the damage. The inhibitor drugs suppress this protein and can stop mutated cells from growing. Side effects from traditional anti-cancer treatments are reduced because only tumour cells with genetic defects are targeted. Professor Johann de Bono, who was the trial chief investigator, said: ‘This opens up the exciting possibility of delivering precise treatment for advanced prostate cancer, guided by genomic testing and based on the molecular characteristics of patients’ tumours. 'It shows that PARP inhibitors can be effective in a wider group of patients than had been thought – in men as well as women, patients with mutations in their tumours as well as those with inherited mutations, and in those with a wider range of gene defects.’ The drug, olaparib, is the first cancer drug to target inherited genetic mutations. It works by blocking the cancer cell’s ability to repair damage . Dr Emma Hall of the Institute of Cancer Research said: ‘We’ve seen a significant improvement in the length of good quality life men can hope to live even with the most advanced prostate cancers. 'These encouraging results show that olaparib could be the next drug to add to those already available.’ The results of the trial were presented at the American Association of Cancer Research conference in Philadelphia. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence will now decide whether olaparib should become widely available on the NHS. A decision is expected in September. Dr Iain Frame of Prostate Cancer UK said: ‘We want to get to a stage where every man gets the treatment he needs for his specific cancer.’ Researchers did not specify the length of time for which olaparib was able to stop advanced prostate cancer worsening.",Olaparib is the first cancer drug to target inherited genetic mutations . Up to 30 per cent of men with advanced prostate cancer have tumours with genetic defects  - and they responded well to olaparib .

"Former England captain Mike Gatting believes Kevin Pietersen should not walk straight back into the international set-up, even if he piles on the runs for Surrey this season. Pietersen has returned to the LV= County Championship in a bid to stake a claim for an England recall, although the 34-year-old only managed 19 runs against Glamorgan on Sunday. England were held to a draw in the opening Test of a three-match series against West Indies last week, and calls for a Pietersen comeback continue to linger ahead of the Ashes this summer. Kevin Pietersen scored 170 in his first outing for Surrey this season but scored just 19 against Glamorgan . 'There are a few bridges that still need to be rebuilt,' said Gatting, who had just penned a congratulation message to James Anderson, England's leading Test wicket-taker, as part of Slazenger's celebratory flag tour. 'Even if KP scores runs there might not be spaces available. If Gary Ballance, Ian Bell and Joe Root play well, there might not be a place for him. 'You've got to have somebody who isn't playing well to get Pietersen in. 'He doesn't just come straight back - that would be unfair on the people in there at the moment. 'If he does get runs, fine, but that's not the end of it. 'If people are playing well in the team, why should he just get straight in?' Pietersen is keen to play for England again after being sacked in 2014 . Bell and Ballance both hit centuries in Antigua while Root also showed signs of good form with scores of 83 and 59. The scorecard was less encouraging for England captain Alastair Cook, however, who could only manage 11 and 13, stretching his run without a Test century to 33 innings. Cook's poor performances saw him removed as One-Day captain before the World Cup earlier this year and Gatting admits more questions will be asked of the England skipper if he fails to find runs against West Indies. 'Alastair knows what he's got to do, he's got to get some runs,' Gatting said. 'We can keep speculating but I suspect at the end of the West Indies series, they'll look at it and if he hasn't got any runs there might be some questions asked. Gary Ballance scored a century in the first Test against West Indies . 'He might possibly get the series against New Zealand - the fact is Alastair has got more 100s than anyone else has and people do go through bad patches in their careers. 'Alastair has had a break, when he was left out of the One-Day series, he's had time to get himself sorted. 'Maybe he needs a break from the captaincy, that's for people to sit and decide, I suspect it's about the runs though, not the captaincy. 'He's a well-respected man in the team, the fact is he's a batsman, he's a captain and if he fails to get the runs somebody will have to make a decision.' Cook's future may be affected by who the England and Wales Cricket Board chooses for the new director of cricket role, created to replace sacked managing director Paul Downton. Mike Gatting has signed a giant flag congratulating Jimmy Anderson on becoming the leading England wicket taker in Test matches . Michael Vaughan, Andrew Strauss and Alec Stewart have all been mentioned in connection with the post, but Gatting is unsure what the point of the position will be. 'I've tried to think what the role could be,' Gatting said. 'If it's going to be someone more hands on with the team, how is that going to affect the coach? 'Can it be any different to the job Paul Downton did? You do need someone in charge of the overall structure. 'At the end of the day, it's all about the players - it's about how they perform. 'I just hope the ECB don't rush into the decision and they get the right person, because different people will do a different type of job.' Former MCC president Mike Gatting was signing Slazenger's 'Congratulations Jimmy' flag which will be touring the country this week. Slazenger is celebrating Jimmy Anderson becoming England's all-time leading Test wicket-taker by giving 10 per cent off its entire cricket range.

"No blame: Baroness Hale of Richmond said that she wanted to see the bitterness taken out of most matrimonial disputes . Divorce laws in England and Wales should remove the need for allegations of adultery and blame, Britain’s most senior female judge has said. Baroness Hale of Richmond said that she wanted to see the bitterness taken out of most matrimonial disputes so a person does not need to be held at fault in order to obtain a divorce. Divorcing couples currently have to cite one of five reasons: adultery; unreasonable behaviour; desertion for two or more years; two years’ separation with consent; or five years’ separation without consent. The second reason – unreasonable behaviour’ – is by far the most widely used. Around 120,000 couples divorce in England and Wales each year and those who want to divorce quickly are encouraged to cite unfaithfulness or unreasonable behaviour, which, critics argue, encourages recriminations. Lady Hale, who is deputy president to the Supreme Court and the only woman among the 12 Supreme Court justices, also wants couples to be made to sort out arrangements for children and money before obtaining a divorce as part of the overhaul. She told The Times: ‘We should make it take longer to get a divorce and encourage people to sort out what happens to the home, children, money before, rather than after, they get a divorce.’ Couples would have a one-year ‘cooling off period’ after declaring that their marriage had permanently broken down in order for them to sort out arrangements. Lady Hale, 70, was behind the move for ‘no fault’ divorce in England and Wales 20 years ago. Conservative MPs saw off the proposals and said that removing fault would take away responsibility and undermine the concept of marriage. Last night campaigners and lawyers backed the proposed overhaul. Resolution: Lady Hale also wants arrangements for children and money resolved before divorce is finalised . Sir Paul Coleridge, former family High Court judge and chairman of the Marriage Foundation, told The Times: ‘Lady Hale, a complete expert with decades of experience across this whole field, is entirely right. ‘Our current system which pretends to be fault-based is in practice and reality no such thing. 'The fault is largely invented to get a quick divorce — a hangover from pre-1970 days which is manipulated by lawyers and parties.’",Baroness Hale of Richmond wants to see 'bitterness' taken out of disputes .

"Manny Pacquiao has become one of the most recognisable stars in the world of sport after a series of mega-fights and another one to follow on Saturday night against Floyd Mayweather at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. The Filipino has been involved in some of the biggest bouts in the world over the past decade or so, facing the likes of Oscar De La Hoya, Ricky Hatton, Miguel Cotto and four fights against Mexican warrior Juan Manuel Marquez. But it's been a tough road to the top for Pacquiao from being born into poverty in the Philippines. He spent the early part of his career boxing in the Far East before being given his chance on the big stage in 2001 against Lehlo Ledwaba in an IBF world super-bantamweight title fight in Las Vegas.

Ever since dethroning the South African world champion on that June night at the MGM Grand 14 years ago, Pacquiao hasn't looked back and is set to take on Mayweather in the Fight of the Century on Saturday. Just days away from the $300million showdown on the Vegas Strip, pictures have emerged of Pacquiao as a teenager in a Manila boxing gym, when occasions such as this Saturday night were just a dream. Pacquiao moved away from home a the age of 14 to the country's capital Manila to pursue his boxing career and the rest, as they say, is history. The 36-year-old is now one of the biggest stars in the world. These incredible pictures show Pacquiao training at the LM Gym in Manila in 1996 at the age of 17 after he won his first 10 professional bouts - all of which were in 1995. In the same year that these pictures were taken, Mayweather was preparing to box at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, which ended for him in a controversial loss  against Serafim Todorov in the semi-finals. Nineteen years later, Mayweather and Pacquiao will finally cross paths in the biggest fight of this generation. The pair will make their first public appearances of the week on Tuesday as the bout draws ever closer. Boxing fans have already begun pouring into Las Vegas to taste the atmosphere building around the richest fight in history, even though only 500 tickets for the clash were made available for general sale. Pacquiao will host a fans' rally on Tuesday at the Mandalay Bay Hotel with trainer Freddie Roach, promoter Bob Arum and his pet Jack Russell Pacman also present. Attention then turns to the MGM Grand, the venue for the fight on Saturday and where Mayweather will be making his grand arrival. The welterweight rivals were both due to attend the traditional grand arrival that marks the beginning of fight week only for Arum to withdraw Pacquiao, claiming the event is a 'waste of time'. Arum also pulled the plug on a media conference call with Pacquiao last week before a question had been asked, while Mayweather spoke for almost half an hour the following night. The one upmanship is sure to continue until fight day. Pacquiao has been involved in some of the biggest fights over the last decade but Saturday's occasion will eclipse all of them .

"These shocking photographs show the bed where a severely disabled boy was left to sleep for seven nights in hospital. They show two mattresses squeezed together on the cramped hospital floor, with wires from an oxygen tank and tubes dangling across the room. Cody Neatis, from Preston, was admitted to Royal Preston Hospital last Thursday with a chest infection. But rather than a bed in the children's ward, has had to sleep on a mattress on the floor since arriving. The eight-year-old - who has Down's syndrome, epilepsy, autism and is fed by a tube - has been without a hospital bed because staff do not have the special cot he needs to keep him safe in his sleep. Cody Neatis, eight, has been in hospital for a week with a chest infection but has had to sleep on a mattress on the floor as the hospital doesn't have a suitable bed for him to sleep in . Cody has Down's syndrome, epilepsy, autism and is fed by a tube. The hospital does not have the specialist high-sided cot he must sleep in, to prevent him from injuring himself in the night . Cody's mother, Lynne Neatis, 48, has had to sleep with Cody - who has a developmental age of 12 months - on the mattress. She watches him sleep in case he pulls out his oxygen or hurts himself in the night . His mother, Lynne, 48, has slept on the floor alongside him for the past week. She fears her son - who has a developmental age of around 12 months - will injure himself or pull out his oxygen. She is now demanding answers from the local health trust as she claims she has waited two years for the high-sided bed needed for Cody and other disabled children. The mother-of-six said: 'Cody was admitted to hospital last Thursday and we were told there was no special needs bed for him. 'This situation has been ongoing  for years with this hospital and I don't understand why they still don't have a suitable bed. 'We had to stay in for nine days in August 2013, I complained about it then and was told that the ward was getting a special needs bed. 'So I fully expected them to have it this time, but there is still nothing.' She added: 'They have baby cots and single beds with side rails, but they aren't safe as Cody rolls around so much in his sleep and is restless all night long. 'I have to sleep on the floor with him and I have had to fight for a nurse or health care assistant to be with us during the night to watch him too as I can't stay awake for 24 hours. 'It has been a very stressful and exhausting time.' Cody's father Stephen Neatis, 45, said he 'cannot believe' his family are forced to sleep on the floor during their stay in hospital . Cody's mother says she has been battling the hospital for a special bed ever since Cody was forced to stay there two years ago in 2013 . While Mrs Neatis is furious at the lack of provisions for disabled children, the hospital trust insists it has ordered a suitable bed from America and is waiting for it to arrive. Karen Partington, chief executive at Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the hospital, said other sleeping arrangements had been offered, but the family had agreed a mattress on the floor would be the safest option at this point. She added: 'We offered Mum the options of a traditional bed plus 1:1 nursing staff and we also brought in a special bed again with 1:1 nursing. 'We believe we have appropriate beds available to meet the needs of Cody along with appropriate nursing support. 'However based on the options available her preference was for Cody to have a mattress on the floor.' Mrs Neatis and husband Stephen, 45, are full time carers not only to Cody, but his brother Dexter, seven, who is also disabled and has autism and ADHD. Cody has to be tube fed and cannot be left unattended. At home he sleeps in a specialist bed which cost more the family more than £3,000. Mr Neatis said he cannot believe his family are forced to sleep on the floor during a stay in hospital. Cody, pictured here with his father, has to be tube fed and can't be left unattended. At home he sleeps in a specialist bed which cost more the family more than £3,000. Mrs Neatis says she has had to ask for staff to come and help her watch Cody sleep, as she can't stay awake 24 hours a day . He said: 'I just can't believe that there is nothing to cater for him, or that they wouldn't try to at least get something for him during the stay. 'I got a call from Lynne and she is having to stay with him on the floor. 'We have one of the special needs beds at home and I saw the two guys assemble it, it took half an hour so it wouldn't be a big job to move one. There must be one somewhere.' Mrs Neatis threatened to take Cody home after finding out the sleeping arrangements but his oxygen levels fall dangerously low when he is taken off the ventilator so he cannot be discharged. She said she was told the hospital did get a special bed and used it on a trial basis, but it proved unsatisfactory. She said: 'When they came up with the idea of sleeping on a mattress on the floor I told them I would take him home as we had a bed there but his oxygen levels were too low. 'I told staff he needs someone to watch him all night long but they made me feel like I was being awkward and said they had no staff to do that. 'I took the photo of Cody and the floor and sent it to my friend who tweeted it and that night we had a nurse, and for the next two nights we had a health care assistant, they were great. Mrs Neatis said when she first heard about the sleeping arrangements at the hospital, she said she would take Cody home. But his oxygen levels were so low that he couldn't be discharged . Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, who run Royal Preston Hospital, say they have ordered a special bed from America and are waiting for it to arrive . The chief executive came to see me and she was really nice. 'But on the fourth night they said there was a staff shortage again so I threatened to take him home - I took his oxygen out but they insisted we stay, and someone did come to watch him. 'Other hospitals have these beds and special needs children are admitted to hospital more often than other children so I don't understand why it's so difficult here. The bed wouldn't be left unused, she claims. She said: 'I know of other parents who have had the same problem and have brought their own special needs beds with them from home.' A spokesperson for the trust told MailOnline that a specialist bed from America was due to arrive in February, but the delivery was delayed. Chief executive Ms Partington added: 'Our priority is to always provide excellent care with compassion for our patients and we have had several discussions with Cody's family regarding his care. 'We are awaiting delivery of a specialist bed from America and we have discussed a number of alternatives with Cody's family, which have been declined.' 'Clearly when making these decisions regarding the care of children we believe it is important to do so in collaboration with parents. We continue to work with her to find a solution that meets Cody's needs and his mum's preferences.'","Cody Neatis, 8, has Down's syndrome, epilepsy and autism and is tube-fed .

"The devastated fiance of the late 'wellness warrior' Jessica Ainscough has written an emotional letter to her followers, revealing she was undergoing radiation treatment in her final weeks and 'giggling and drinking green smoothies' in her hospital bed until the day she died. Ms Ainscough, 30, died in late February following a lengthy fight with a rare and aggressive form of cancer known as epithelioid sarcoma. She spurned chemotherapy and radiation, choosing to fight the cancer with a controversial treatment known as Gerson Therapy, which involves a vegan diet and coffee enemas and does not have scientific support. But after discussions with 'oncologists, healers and specialists around the world', in her final weeks - the most 'difficult' weeks of her fight - Ms Ainscough began a course of targeted radiation, her partner Tallon Pamenter has revealed. 'This was a risky and tough decision, but Jess bravely embraced this last chance option,' he said. Jessica Ainscough (left) was planning to marry her partner Tallon Pamenter this year. She died after a long fight with cancer in February . 'This year has stripped me from the one thing that brought magic to every other aspect of my life,' Mr Pamenter said . Tribute: Jessica Ainscough died in late February after a seven-year-long battle with cancer . 'In true wellness warrior style, we integrated our natural healing regime with the recommended radiation. 'Finally the walls were broken down between conventional and unconventional medicine - I don't know why as a society we must choose one or the other. 'This was something Jess was looking forward with sharing (with her followers). It was an exciting evolution from her earlier days of feeling that she had to be part of one extreme world or the other.' Mr Pamenter said the six weeks of her radiation were among the toughest the couple - who were planning to marry this year - had been through. 'Jess displayed a sense of courage and grace that I am yet to see in anybody else I have ever met - myself included.' The radiation successfully managed to shrink the tumour but 'some complications arose during the final stages of treatment'. 'Not long after, the words I LOVE YOU would leave my lips only to fall softly upon Jess's ears for the last time. 'I said goodbye to the love of my life that day and my heart has been in a million pieces since.' 'Jess displayed a sense of courage and grace that I am yet to see in anybody else I have ever met - myself included,' She 'showed (her partner Tallon) what it means to live in a world full of love', he said in his tribute . 'I said goodbye to the love of my life that day and my heart has been in a million pieces since' 'This year has stripped me from the one thing that brought magic to every other aspect of my life. 'I have been taken to a place so foreign and unknown with no navigational bearing on how to get back. 'Loved ones tell me to be strong during this time... but the thing is I don't want to be strong... I want to cry when I'm sad, yell when I'm angry and smile during those fleeting moments of happiness brought on by the memories we created together. 'I want to sit in silence and be present with every single emotion that decides to show up. 'It's in those moments I feel closest to her.' Ms Ainscough made the decision to undergo radiation after the fungating tumour in her left shoulder became large and painful. It began to interfere with her 'ability to enjoy her favourite things like walking our furbabies on the beach', Mr Parmenter said. Mr Pamenter told Daily Mail Australia she planned to tell her followers about her new treatment just days after she passed away. Ms Ainscough was diagnosed with cancer in 2008 when she was 22 and working at Dolly magazine, a favourite of teenage girls. She initially underwent targeted chemotherapy to her left arm, according to reports, but the cancer returned a year later. She also refused doctors' advice to have her left arm amputated. Jessica's mother was also diagnosed with cancer in 2012, and, inspired by her daughter's fight, she also adopted the Gerson Therapy method. The alternative treatment did not work, and her mother passed away in 2013, an event which Ms Ainscough said brought her to her knees. Mr Pamenter said his partner 'showed me what it means to live in a world full of love'. She was laid to rest in early March.","Devastated fiance of late 'wellness warrior' Jessica Ainscough writes touching tribute to followers .

"West Bromwich Albion had just produced a typical Tony Pulis performance to beat his former club Crystal Palace 2-0 when he claimed he will never change. The 57-year-old’s gritty, resilient playing style is well reflected in the touchline attire he insists on wearing at every game; cap, track suit and shiny white trainers. James Morrison headed in within two minutes and Craig Gardner added a stunning 30-yard strike in the second half, but Alan Pardew’s side dominated the remainder of the game only to be met by West Brom’s stubborn doggedness.

West Brom midfielder James Morrison (right) dribbles with the ball away from Palace's Jason Puncheon (left) All viewed by Pulis beneath the peak of that cap. ‘I’d never take my cap off during a game they’d have to put it in my contract,’ he explained. ‘I watched the first game for Albion and sat upstairs in a suit. I came down after 10 minutes because I’d had enough of sitting there. That’s just the way I am. I want to be close to the action.’ West Brom ended their run of 10 away games without a victory, drawing five and losing five. Pulis will turn up to the stadium in suit and tie, then return to that again straight after the match to address the press before he leaves. Pardew was resplendent in full suit and tie on Saturday. Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino admitted last week that he started smartening up on the sideline after his chairman Daniel Levy told him to. ‘I’ll leave it for all the sophisticated lads,’ Pulis added. ‘I’ve always done it and I don’t see no reason not to just because we’re in the Premier League with all the TV cameras and everything. I’ve done it right from my days at Bournemouth.’ Why change a ritual that works? The three points moved West Brom to 36 points which virtually guarantees them safety. Much like he achieved at Palace last year. That’s worth doffing your cap to. Palace winger Wilfried Zaha (left) is tackled by West Brom's Gardener (right) during the match on Saturday .

"Countdown co-presenter Rachel Riley was left embarrassed on a recent episode of the show when contestants offered up a rather rude eight-letter word as their answer to the word game. Host Nick Hewer faced a conundrum of his own as he tried, and failed, to stifle his giggles as a blushing Ms Riley spelt out the word 'erection'. Hewer, who first found fame as Lord Sugar’s sidekick in The Apprentice, was clearly trying not to laugh when Dubliner Gerry Tynan and Anne Lewin, from Brighton, both offered up the double entendre. Scroll down for video . Countdown co-presenter Rachel Riley looked embarassed when the two contestants  came up with the same eight-letter double entendre in the word game (pictured) as host Nick Hewer failed to stifle his laughter . Fortunately celebrity guest Dr Phil Hammond, who was in dictionary corner with Susie Dent, saved the day with nine letter word 'recondite'. It is not the first time the show's host has struggled to contain himself when a rude word has popped up - last year Hairy Biker Dave Myers offered up the seven-letter word 'todgers', causing much hilarity among the hosts. In February an English teacher shocked viewers when submitting the word 'm*nges', an expletive sometimes used to describe female genitalia. It is not the first time Nick Hewer (pictured) has struggled to contain himself when a rude word has popped up . In 1991, two contestants offered 'w***ers', and in 2010 another suggested 's**tface'. In 2010 the presenters looked uneasy when the letters U, D, F, C, K and E all came up in a selection - but luckily the contestants resisted the temptation to go for the obvious and instead submitted the five letter words 'caged' and 'faced'. It's not the first word to have left Rachel Riley blushing. The former Strictly Come Dancing star found herself stifling laughter after drawing the words 'p*ss' and 'a*se' shortly after replacing Carol Vorderman in 2009. During her 26-year stint, Ms Vorderman was left red-faced more than a few times. Words such as fart, porn and poo were among the collection of letters which had the Loose Women star and her co-hosts laughing.

"Prince Harry will tonight fly out of the UK to Australia without seeing his new niece or nephew . A disappointed Prince Harry will tonight fly out of the UK to Australia without seeing his new niece or nephew. With the Duchess of Cambridge now overdue for the birth of her second child, the prince will not be able to meet the new royal baby until he returns to this country in mid May. Harry, who will be bumped down to fifth in the line of succession by the new arrival, had returned briefly at the weekend to hand out prizes at the London Marathon after undertaking several engagements in Turkey to mark the centenary of the Gallipoli campaign. He was dragging out his return until tonight in the hope of getting to meet the new little prince or princess. But with Duchess now several days overdue, Harry is being forced to return to Australia where he is on a month-long placement with the army, followed by a week long official tour of New Zealand. Instead he spent time playing doting uncle to his nephew, Prince George, who turns two in July, at the Cambridge's apartment at Kensington Palace. Kate and her husband, Prince William, had been told to expect their new son or daughter – who will be fourth in line to the throne – by Saturday, according to sources. The Duchess – whose son, Prince George, was also around a week late - herself told well-wishers earlier this year that the new little prince or princess was due 'mid to late April'. When Prince George's little brother or sister is born the news will be revealed to royal correspondents in a press release followed by an announcement two minutes on the Kensington and Buckingham Palace social media accounts on Twitter and Instagram. Details of their arrival – including their six, birth weight and details of the attending medical staff - will then be posted in the traditional way on an easel outside Buckingham Palace. Scroll down for video . Although palace officials have barred media from camping outside the private Lindo Wing at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, where Kate is due to give birth, in order to prevent what they describe as a 'media circus', excitement was mounting yesterday with royal 'superfans' continuing their own round-the-clock vigil. The Duchess – whose son, Prince George, was also around a week late - herself told well-wishers earlier this year that the new little prince or princess was due 'mid to late April' Harry had returned briefly at the weekend to hand out prizes at the London Marathon after undertaking several engagements in Turkey (pictured) to mark the centenary of the Gallipoli campaign . The mounting tension saw bookmakers' cash in with a flurry of bets on everything from the time of birth to the new baby's name – and even their hair and eye colour. Prince Harry will no doubt be encouraged to see that 4/1 odds are being offered for the baby to be a fellow red head. Ladbrokes customers appeared to favour Arthur for a boy, with odds collapsing to 8/1, and Alice remaining the hot favourite for a girl with odds of just 5/4. Some were still hankering after Diana (14/1), in memory of William's late mother, or even Elizabeth in honour of the Queen (6/1). The firm said one male customer in the Manchester area had bet £10,000 on the new baby being a girl, the largest single wager so far received. Spokesman, Jessica Bridge, said: 'As far as the money is concerned they will soon welcome Princess Alice into the family.' Coral said yesterday that it had seen a slew of bets come in that the baby will arrive today (Monday) – now 6/1 joint favourite – with odds of 10-1 that the nation is still waiting at the end of the week. Many bookmakers are also offering 4/1 odds of the couple welcoming their new child into the world on Wednesday – their fourth wedding anniversary. Prince William and Kate pose with their son Prince George at the National History Museum in London . Preparations have been made outside the Lindo Wing of the hospital for the huge crowds expected to welcome the royal birth - with the Duchess said to be up to four days overdue . As the 'spare to the heir', it is unlikely that the duke and duchess's new baby will accede to the throne – although it is not unheard of. Most recently the Queen's own father became King George VI when his elder brother, King Edward VIII, unexpectedly abdicated over his love for 'unsuitable' American divorcee Wallis Simpson. Thanks to recent changes in the law of succession, if the new baby is girl then their claim to the throne cannot be superseded by a younger brother, should William and Kate go on to have a third child. She will also be known as HRH Princess (forename) of Cambridge after the Queen altered a century-old ruling in the run up to Prince George's birth which had meant that only the eldest son of a Prince of Wales (as well as the children of a monarch and the sons of those children) was entitled to the honour. The new arrival will also bump Prince Andrew out of the 'top five' for the first time. He will drop to sixth in line to the throne. His eldest daughter, Princess Beatrice, will find herself relegated to seventh – the advantage being that she will no longer require the Queen's approval for her marriage. Her younger sister, Princess Eugenie, will become eighth. If the baby is a girl it will be the first Princess of Cambridge to be born for 182 years. Kate has said in the past that she favours a boy but that her husband rather likes the idea of a girl. Grandfather Prince Charles has said he would like a girl – while his late wife, Diana, Princess of Wales, always longed for a daughter.",Prince Harry will  fly out of UK tonight to continue placement in Australia . This means he will not be able to meet royal baby until return in mid-May . He will be bumped down to fifth in the line of succession by the new arrival .

"Jameela spent £3,000 on having all her amalgam fillings removed and replaced with white fillings . Jameela Jamil has the dazzling smile that you'd expect of a television presenter and former model. Yet the 29-year-old broadcaster is convinced her teeth - or rather, the dental work done on them - triggered a host of health problems that plagued her for nearly seven years. 'From the age of 21, I would wake up in the morning with a puffy, swollen face feeling utterly hungover - even though I don't drink,' says Jameela, who has presented the Radio 1 Chart Show and programmes for Channel 4. 'My head felt heavy and I was permanently exhausted. Occasionally, I would even faint. There were days when I'd arrive at work and the make-up artists would send me home because I just looked awful and felt terrible.' After several months of this, she went to a private doctor who referred her for tests. Jameela thought she might have a serious disease such as lupus, an auto-immune condition which can cause inflammation and swelling in the joints and other parts of the body. In fact, the tests suggested she had high levels of mercury. After other potential causes such as diet were ruled out, it was suggested the problem was down to the ten amalgam fillings she'd had as a child. So she spent £3,000 on having them all removed and replaced with white fillings. Dental amalgam has been used for more than 150 years, and every year 12 million fillings made from it are given to patients in Britain. Amalgam remains a standard material to use, especially on back teeth because it is particularly robust. It is made from a mixture of metals including silver, tin and copper. Liquid mercury is used to help mix these components together. Breathing in extremely high concentrations of mercury can trigger bronchitis and pneumonia and affect the central nervous system, causing muscle tremors. Long-term exposure to high levels can affect kidneys. But mercury poisoning is very rare, suggests Dr Prem Mahendra, a consultant haematologist at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham. 'In 27 years as a haematologist I have never been asked to test for mercury,' he says. Dentists agree that when fillings are being put in or removed, the mercury can release vapour. This is absorbed into the bloodstream in the lungs and then taken to the kidneys to be passed out harmlessly in the urine. Blood tests showed she had high mercury levels. With nothing else to account for these raised levels, her fillings were pinpointed as the cause . But the amounts taken in from fillings is 'minuscule', says Salford dentist Dr Ben Atkins. Indeed, a review by the EU Commission's Scientific Committee in 2008 concluded there was no risk from amalgam, says Professor Damien Walmsley, the British Dental Association's scientific adviser. Amalgam is 'strong, durable and adaptable' and there is 'no evidence to suggest these fillings are anything other than safe to use', adds StJohn Crean, professor of medicine in dentistry and an oral and maxillofacial surgeon at the University of Central Lancashire. It is true that mercury can sometimes cause sensitivity and soreness in teeth - 5 per cent of the population react to contact with amalgams in this way - but this poses no risk to health, adds Professor Walmsley. And yet dental amalgam is banned in countries such as Sweden and Norway, because of patient concern about the risk. Finland and Japan have restrictions on its use, with a view to phasing it out. This follows research linking mercury to certain diseases. A 2012 review of 106 studies published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease suggested mercury from amalgams could be a contributing factor to the condition. But fillings aren't the only source of mercury. It can get into the blood through food - nearly all fish and shellfish contain traces, though the Food Standards Agency says this isn't a concern for most people. However, some fish and shellfish contain higher levels of mercury that could harm an unborn baby or young child's developing nervous system. That's why young children and women planning to have a baby or who are already pregnant or breastfeeding are advised to avoid fish that can have higher levels of mercury, such as shark, swordfish and marlin. Pregnant women are advised to limit their tuna to no more than two steaks or four medium-sized cans a week. And yet dental amalgam (pictured, posed by model) is banned in countries such as Sweden and Norway, because of patient concern about the risk . But Jameela doesn't eat fish, so knew the mercury levels couldn't be due to her diet. She's allergic to peanuts, shellfish and dairy foods and at 12 was diagnosed with coeliac disease - a condition which causes an adverse reaction to gluten, found in wheat, barley and rye. Following blood tests, it was discovered that she had high mercury levels. With nothing else to account for these raised levels, her fillings were pinpointed as the cause. 'All I could think of was I had to get rid of them,' says Jameela. But while she expected her symptoms to immediately subside once her fillings were removed, they continued to affect her over the next few years. 'I hated the fatigue, the headaches, the fact I should have been fit and healthy but felt rotten all the time,' Jameela says. 'I read up on this and discovered that not only does it take time for mercury levels to drop, but vapour can be released from the mercury when the fillings are removed and leak into the system. 'I think that the mercury was affecting my immune and digestive system.' Dentist Dr Atkins has spoken to many patients who have wanted to have their silver fillings removed because they're concerned about the potential health issues. But he warns that removing amalgams can do more harm than good as more vapour can be inhaled into the system by doing this. 'Aside from the fact there is no evidence to suggest amalgams are anything other than safe, every time a dentist drills a tooth, they remove a little dental tissue. So you are essentially damaging the tooth,' he says. The number of fillings in the average adult's mouth . Still struggling, Jameela saw a nutritionist who recommended drinking solutions made from clay and algae chlorella three times a day. These apparently bind to mercury and help remove it. She did this for two years, and tried various diets to tackle the 'inflammation' linked to the mercury that was making her ill. 'For my 25th birthday, my flatmate gave me a piece of melon with a candle in it - cake was out of the question,' she says. 'It took about a year before I started to feel better. It's all had a massive impact on my life.' However, Anton Emmanuel, consultant gastroenterologist at University College Hospital, London, is not convinced mercury could affect digestion in this way. 'You would have to be exposed to massive overdoses of mercury for the gut to be affected,' he says. 'Not in the level or forms that you get with mercury fillings. 'In fact, I see patients whose gut symptoms, ironically, seem to be caused by the stress and anxiety of thinking that it is their mercury fillings which are causing stomach problems, when there is no physical sign of any gut disorders.' But Jameela remains convinced that the mercury was the cause of her problems. 'There is so much we don't know about amalgam fillings. I know I feel much better now,' she says. Private clinics offer mercury testing. But Dr Mahendra says anyone thinking of having this done should check that the clinic's laboratories have clinical pathology accreditation (CPA) to ensure that the tests are carried out properly.

"Sao Paulo, Brazil (CNN)Hundreds of thousands of Brazilians are taking to the streets in protests across the country, lashing out against President Dilma Rousseff as she struggles with an economic downturn and a massive bribery scandal. The demonstrators have called for the President to be impeached. On the other side Rousseff's base is holding rallies in her support. There are a number of issues at play. One of the biggest: an investigation into a multimillion-dollar kickback scheme at the state-run oil company Petrobras. Petrobras was long considered the corporate jewel in Brazil's crown, one of the biggest companies in the world by market capitalization. But last year, investigators launched a sweeping investigation. According to suspects-turned-witnesses, construction companies paid bribes to executives at Petrobras as well as politicians to secure lucrative contracts. Most of the politicians accused in the investigation belong to the President's Workers Party and its allies. During many of the years that the alleged corruption took place, Rousseff was the chairwoman of Petrobras. There hasn't been any evidence she was involved with the scheme, and her supporters say the position is merely a figurehead. Rousseff has defended Brazilians' right to protest and acknowledged the need to clean up corruption at Petrobras -- but denied any prior knowledge of it. But Brazilians are still outraged. Rousseff won re-election with just over 50% of valid votes in October, but her approval rating plummeted to 13% after the protests last month. Compounding the frustration is the economy, which is expected to contract this year. Inflation is stubbornly high, and the currency has lost more than 20% of its value against the dollar this year alone. Both sides are. The country was already sharply divided during presidential elections in October. Roughly half of the voting population didn't vote for Rousseff, and many of those same people joined protests immediately after elections. Rousseff's supporters like to characterize the protesters as Brazilian elite and right-wingers, and some small groups do carry signs calling for a military intervention to oust the President. But with the Petrobras scandal growing and the economy sinking, the protests have gotten bigger and broader, with many demonstrators saying they initially voted for Rousseff. Protesters say Rousseff should be impeached for failing to halt the corruption at Petrobras. On the other hand, labor unions, social activists and groups such as the Landless Workers Movement who support the government have organized their own marches. The demonstrations are meant as a show of force for democracy, with participants saying the President was democratically elected and cannot be impeached. But participation has not been consistently strong. The President has said Petrobras should be cleaned up. Has she done anything about it? She says she's given prosecutors and the Federal Police free rein to investigate the Petrobas scandal. Some of her allies who have been implicated in the investigation think Rousseff should do more to protect them. This scandal has been known publicly for at least a year, and during Rousseff's election campaign, she said she would root out corruption. The Brazilian economy was booming for the good part of a decade, bolstered by voracious demand for its commodities from China. But with China's economy cooling, Brazil has failed to find a successful alternative to promote growth and shore up investor confidence. Now, with the President's approval rating abysmally low, it will be difficult to implement the savings needed to get the economy back on track. Rousseff has appointed a market-friendly economy minister, Joaquim Levy, to try and fix the country's fiscal problems. But in the current political crisis, he hasn't been able to make much progress.",Protesters angry over bribery scandal involving state-run oil company Petrobras .

"An alleged fraudster has been accused of posing as Oprah Winfrey, executives from her TV network, former Obama aide Reggie Love and Madonna's manager in an attempt to trick people into giving him jobs, clothes, free food and jewelry worth $2.4million. Justin Jackson, a Florida man, has been carrying out the bizarre schemes in the hope of cashing in on the freebies, or winning himself a job in luxurious hotels, according to court documents. Jackson is being sued by Oprah's TV network as well as Love - the college basketball star who went on to be the President's personal assistant. 'Con man': Justin Jackson, right, has been accused of pretending to be a host of celebrity-linked characters in order to score freebies and jobs. Angel Agarrat, left, is also named in a Florida lawsuit attempting to get the pair to stop posing as other people . Legal papers filed in a south Florida federal court describe Jackson waging an eight-year trail of deceit in which he variously posed as Oprah herself, Oprah's nephew, Love, an executive at the Oprah Winfrey Network (OWN), and managers of Madonna and Johnny Depp. The earliest fraud, the papers said, saw Jackson trick a New York City jeweler into lending him items worth $2.4million by pretending to be Madonna's manager. He contacted a store in July 2007 and said she needed the lavish items for a photoshoot, the papers said. When he got the items, he reportedly sold them to another jeweler and fled. The court papers say he was convicted for grand theft over the ruse, but later dreamed up new celebrity-linked schemes. The latest claims say Jackson pretended to be Oprah and her representatives in the hope of getting more freebies - and even posed as the famous talk show host to recommend him for jobs. He allegedly sent letters on forged OWN stationery to  five different hotel groups with locations in Florida, recommending himself for work at the locations. 'Impersonator': Jackson (right) is accused of sending messages purporting to be former Obama aide Reggie Love (left), whom he said worked for Oprah. The right-hand photograph, court papers claim, was emailed from an email account allegedly belonging to Johnny Depp's manager, asking for tickets to see Oprah . The papers claim some of the notes purportedly to be directly from Oprah, while others claimed to be from Love, who was signed off as the star's 'executive assistant and personal aide'. Also named in the claims was Angel Agarrat, whom lawyers claim was also involved in the deception, and was subject of some of the bogus letters of recommendation for jobs. In one of the exchanges, Jackson allegedly suggested that if he and Agarrat were to be given work at the hotels, Oprah would make a personal appearance there. One letter even claimed Jackson was Oprah's nephew. Love has never worked for Oprah. Other schemes allegedly saw Jackson write to four different jewelry companies, as well as a clothe retailer, to get free goods allegedly meant for Oprah. Scheme: According to the claims, Jackson signed some emails off as Oprah, left, and others as Scott Garner, an executive at the Oprah Winfrey Network . The claims date from around September 2013 to the end of 2014. The documents also say Jackson has a history of pretending to be Love, and had tried in 2010 to trade off Love's own name to get free designer clothes, handbags and Cheesecake Factory vouchers. In a final case, Jackson . OWN, Love and Scott Garner, an executive at Oprah's company whose name was used, filed a joint suit against Jackson and Agarrat this week. It accuses the two of invasion of privacy, misappropriation of names, infringing trademarks and conspiracy. The documents ask that a judge files an injunction to stop the two using any of the false names, and also stakes a claim for financial damages. Although no figures are specified, arguments in the court papers imply that the figure will be at least $75,000.","Justin Jackson allegedly pretended to be celebrity-linked characters .

Plunkett has recovered from a minor ankle complaint in Yorkshire's pre-season trip to Abu Dhabi . A minor ankle complaint during Yorkshire's pre-season trip to Abu Dhabi proved to be nothing more than a brief setback and he is now looking to make a name for himself in a part of the world that is famous for its quick men. 'I'm trying to be the fastest (bowler on the pitch). I train hard at it and I feel that's why I stand out from the rest,' he said ahead of Monday's two-day warm-up against a St Kitts & Nevis Invitation XI. 'I feel like I'm adaptable but you might need those little patches in the game - where it's a bit dead and there's good batters - to try and rough them up a bit.

"Freddo Frog has shrunk from 15g to 12g . Cadbury is cutting the size of its beloved Freddo Frogs by 20 per cent but keeping the recommend retail price the same. The miniature chocolate amphibians, which weighed a plump 20g two years ago - before they dropped to 15g, will now weigh just 12g. The shrinking of one of Australia’s most popular children’s chocolates was not widely announced but was in fact spotted by a shop owner who stocks the treats, the Herald Sun reports. Cadbury’s spokesman Julian Polachek said: ‘We’re making a change to the size of the product because of manufacturing cost increases that we can no longer absorb.’ The Freddo’s downsize is just the latest product to feel the pinch in the declining confectionery world. In February, chocolate lovers expressed their anger after Cadbury announced plans to reduce the size of their family blocks by ‘one row’ in a cost cutting deal. The best-selling blocks dropped from 220 grams to 200 grams. The Australasia managing director for Mondelez International, Cadbury’s parent company, Amanda Banfield told the Financial Review: ‘Clearly any chocolate lover is going to be a bit disappointed.’ Anticipating a backlash, Ms Banfield explained the company had decided the shrink the family block because of ‘unprecedented cost headwinds’. She blamed the increased price of ingredients and rising packaging costs for the change. Cadbury still recommends the blocks are sold for $4.99 – a price which won’t increase or decrease – but Ms Banfield highlighted that shops set the prices that they choose to sell the products at in store. Cadbury's parent company’s profit before tax rose 46 per cent from $87 million to $127 million in 2013. Thousands of angry chocolate fans complained about the change on Cadbury’s Facebook page. Creator of the Freddo Frog, Harry Melbourne, who thought up the idea of the chocolate frog named Freddo when he was an 18-year-old. He died aged 94 in 2007 .

You are plain greedy.’ ‘Good bye Cadbury it has been a fun ride, but when you make it not worth it and unaffordable and then lie pffft not worth wasting my money how much would it cost to change the size of the chocolate with new moulds smaller packaging lots of money I would assume. I'll just wait for the tim tams to go on sale,’ Kirsty Logan commented. Nestle has sliced its Killer Python lolly in half in a bid to help Australians better manage their health . Cadbury chocolate produced for the Australian market is made in Claremont in Tasmania. A statement on the company’s website read: ‘Confectionery companies around the world are feeling the squeeze of increasing costs. At Cadbury, we’re feeling it too. We’ve reached a point where we can no longer absorb these increasing costs into the price of our chocolate blocks.’ In October last year, Cadbury rival Nestle sliced its Killer Python lolly in half in an apparent bid to help Australians better manage their health. The new 'treat size' Allen's Killer Python measures 21cm instead of 32.5cm and weighs 24g instead of 47g. Nestle has also reduced the size of Smarties 'fun size' boxes from 20g to 16g. The move is part of Nestle's efforts to help Australians improve their health by controlling the amount of food they eat - 'especially treats'. The company said the Killer Pythons still have the same 'recipe, taste and stretchiness' but the new size cuts the lolly's kilojoules from 630 to 336, meaning a 10-year-old can run it off in 30 minutes instead of one hour. Customers have expressed their outrage over the move but Nestle's General Manager of Confectionery, Martin Brown, said it was the 'right thing to do'. Nestle has also reduced the size of Smarties 'fun size' boxes from 20g to 16g . The new 'treat size' Allen's Killer Python measures 21cm instead of 32.5cm . 'I think lollies are just such a fun part of growing up and people have got a lot of passion for them, I really understand that, l used to love eating Killer Pythons as a kid,' Mr Brown told Daily Mail Australia. 'I can understand why there will be some disappointed Python fans, it's a short term sacrifice because it will upset customers and we'll sell less Pythons but it's the right thing to do for ongoing trust. 'This is a really important initiative for a product primarily eaten by kids, getting it at the right portion.' When Red Rock Deli chips dropped 20 grams from their packets the prize remained the same . The company said the new treat size Killer Pythons bags are the same price as the old ones, but have gone up in weight, so customers will be getting more lolly snakes in smaller portion sizes. The recommended retail price on individual Killer Pythons will be halved from $1 to 50 cents. In the past manufacturers have been called out for slashing product sizes while keeping the same packing and price. Red Rock Deli-Style potato chips were shrunk by 20 grams. And Choice spotted Oat Crisp Honey cereal packets were reduced by 14 per cent while maintaining similar packaging and that the price per 100 grams increased by 10 per cent.",Cadbury's Freddo Frogs have decreased from 15g to 12g .

I don’t like her having it as they’re not supposed to, but she just takes it. But Gizzi insists that living in a foodie household isn't to blame. 'It’s not my influence at all, she’s just a pig!'

When I make taramasalata she’ll eat and eat and eat it, it’s her death row dish. 'She loves cheese, caviar and anything really fishy.' But Kimchi occasionally indulges in cat food and is 'obsessed' with Dreamies cat biscuits. 'It’s insane,' says Gizzi. 'She purrs as she eats and she doesn’t do that normally.' Gizzi also recently added a new addition to her cat family, Ponzu, named after her favourite Japanese dressing. 'I was also thinking about calling him Neeps or Haggis as he’s Scottish, but it didn’t suit him, so eventually I just went with what suited him best. He was nameless for a week,' she says. 'Kimchi is called Kimchi because of my love of Korean food,' she adds. The new addition to the Erskine feline family is also a food lover - and has even more unusual tastes.

'I’d love a really small cat tattoo as well, either behind my ear or somewhere discreet. I think more people are getting cat tattoos now, it’s become more popular.'

"A group of U.S. senators has written to football's world governing body FIFA, calling for Russia to be removed as host of the 2018 World Cup because of its role in the Ukraine crisis and occupation of Crimea. In a letter dated Tuesday and released on Wednesday, the 13 Democratic and Republican U.S. lawmakers said they 'strongly encourage' FIFA to move the global competition. 'Allowing Russia to host the World Cup inappropriately bolsters the prestige of the (Russian President Vladimir) Putin regime at a time when it should be condemned and provides economic relief at a time when much of the international community is imposing economic sanctions,' the senators wrote to FIFA President Sepp Blatter. FIFA president Sepp Blatter announces Russia as the host nation for the 2018 World Cup . Republican John McCain is one of 13 US senators urging FIFA to think again . The lead signers were Senator Robert Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Senator Ron Johnson, the Republican chairman of the foreign relations panel's Europe subcommittee. Republican Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, also signed the letter, as did Senator Richard Durbin, the number two Democrat in the Senate.

FIFA announced last week that the decision on the 2026 tournament will be made in 2017 - when Blatter is still likely to be FIFA president.

"A Spanish town on the Camino de Santiago pilgrimage route is warning pilgrims and other visitors to stop defecating along the famous path. Graphic signs telling visitors not to stop for a poo break during their walk to the holy city of Santiago de Compostela, in north-western Spain, have been erected in the municipality of Lastres. But no one knows who put up the signs, which show a squatting figure defecating within a red circle with a diagonal line across it. Someone in the municipality of Lastres has posted signs warning pilgrims not to defecate on the trail . The pilgrimage, known as the Way of St James, attracts thousands of pilgrims every year, but there can be very few places to go when nature calls. In Lastres, angry residents have complained about pilgrims defecating outside their homes. The signs are posted next to warnings that urge people not to litter. The pilgrimage begins at various points, with the longest route nearly 500 miles from the Spain-France border, which lead to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, where Saint James the Great is said to be buried. Antonio Fernandez, a resident of Lastres, told Spain’s EFE news agency that the signs are found to be so amusing they have become an attraction. Some pilgrims will walk nearly 500 miles (800 kilometres) to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela . Pilgrims and other visitors are now stopping to pose for photos with them, he added. Two other residents, Jose Ramon Fernandez and his wife, Maria Paz, said they were surprised the warning signs were posted, as the pilgrims ‘are very polite’ and ‘always friendly’. Lantres is a parish in Santos, and its mayor said ‘it makes no sense’ that there are no public facilities for pilgrims at regular points during their long journey on the historic route. Julio Gallego told the Spanish newspaper La Voz de Galicia that it is a ‘huge failure’ that needs to be remedied.",No one knows who put up the signs in the municipality of Lastres .

"Planners in Windsor have allowed two Costa cafes less than 500 yards apart (file picture) Coffee addicts in Windsor won't have to go far for a fix – after planners in the royal borough allowed two Costa shops less than 500 yards apart. And anyone really desperate can always stop off at the Costa Express in between. The latest Costa will open on the site of the former Dedworth Road HSBC branch, the last bank in the area before it closed last year amid protests. Less than 500 yards away is a Costa which replaced a cycle shop earlier this year. It means there will be two Costas just a brisk five-minute walk apart, plus the Costa Express at a petrol station between them. One resident, Samantha Taylor, wrote online: 'I think it's mad and I wish our local councils could see that we are drowning in fast food and coffee shops in Windsor.' However, Matt Gordon-Smith said: 'The important point here is that this is in Dedworth which formerly wouldn't have had such businesses coming here. 'Surely places like Costa coming in rather than another fast-food shop or betting shop - there will soon be three within a mile - is that a sign that this part of Windsor is on the up?' Costa's planning application says the new shop would be a 'significant driver to local trade'. Planners said there was no legal reason to refuse. Costa were unavailable for comment.

"There is an image of Jose Mourinho and Pep Guardiola deep in conversation during a Barcelona training session that did the rounds on social media a few years ago. Mourinho was Bobby Robson’s assistant at Barcelona and Guardiola was in his final years as a player at the Camp Nou at the time. The picture became the perfect ‘guess the caption’ competition the best one having Guardiola say to Mourinho: ‘I’ll be Barça coach one day and I’ll win the treble’ and Mourinho replying: ‘yeah right, and I’ll manage Real Madrid.’ Jose Mourinho and Pep Guardiola in deep conversation following a Barcelona training session . No sooner had Luis Enrique joined Barcelona at the start of this season and the photo libraries threw up an even better shot – one of Luis Enrique, Pep and Jose in their time at Barcelona. Then the archive scanners began to notice something about some of the other faces in the pictures from this era – isn’t that current PSG coach Laurent Blanc? And isn’t that current Porto coach Julen Lopetegui? And aren’t four of the coaches of the last eight in this season’s Champions League from the same club at the same time? (From L-R) Barcelona's Juan Carlos Busquets, Luis Enrique, Mourinho and Guardiola at training . Laurent Blanc comes up against Enrique at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday in the Champions League . Blanc was a huge part of the Barcelona XI that won the Spanish Super Cup under Bobby Robson in 1996 . Luis Enrique comes face to with Blanc in the Parc des Princes stadium on Wednesday night and both will have plenty to catch up on. They were both in the Barça team that started the 1996-97 season by winning the Spanish Super Cup against Atletico Madrid 6-4 on aggregate. With Robson in charge and Mourinho’s assisting him the team that won the first silverware of the new season included not just the French World Cup winner and the 62-times Spain international and the aforementioned Lopetegui and Guardiola but Albert Ferrer, who started the season as Cordoba coach; Abelardo Fernandez, who is now coaching Sporting Gijon in Spain’s second tier; and Sergi Barjuan, who has just taken over at Almeria.

Also in the team were Hristo Stoichkov who has coached Celta Vigo and Bulgaria among others and Juan Antonio Pizzi, who managed Valencia last season and is now at Leon in Mexico. Even those players from that team who never went on to manage have stayed in football with Giovanni now working as a scout for Olympiakos and Guillermo Amor a former director of Barcelona’s youth academy who is now director of football at Adelaide United FC.

Enrique travels to Paris to take on Blanc's PSG side at the Parc des Princes in the Champions League . Ahead of his meeting with Blanc on Wednesday, Luis Enrique crossed swords with old friend and former team-mate Sergi Barjuan two weeks ago when Barça played Almeria. “It was the last thing we looked like becoming,” he said when I asked the Barcelona manager if both he and Sergi had looked like coaches-in-waiting in their playing days. “You change the way you look at things once you retire.” Luis Enrique believes those who played in positions where they had the pitch in front of them for most of the game – the full-backs, the centre-backs, Pep Guardiola in holding midfield – went on to coach in part because of how tactically astute they had had to become to be successful in their positions as players.

It’s perhaps more of a surprise that so many attacking players also graduated to the technical area. Some will have got jobs because they played for Barcelona rather than because of all they learned at Barça – it’s the irresistible pull of giving a Barça old boy a job in the hope he will be able to build a side in his former team’s image.

"A selection of thirsty animals were captured drinking water in their own unique way – and the results are hilarious. Elad Hershkowitz, a zookeeper at the Zoological Center in Tel Aviv, placed a GoPro camera at the bottom of water troughs to capture the different perspectives. The animals – ranging from a rhino who almost kisses the surface of the water to a lemur who delicately licks it – were recorded for a total of 30 hours. Zookeeper Elad Hershkowitz, of the Zoological Center in Tel Aviv, filmed animals drinking on a GoPro camera . He placed the camera in the animals' water troughs and filmed them  for a total of 30 hours . The 26-year-old then cut the final footage down to four minutes. He said: ‘Capturing this footage was really special. It offers a completely unique perspective to anything I’ve ever seen before. ‘I had the idea whilst walking around the enclosures and I saw the zebras drinking. ‘It made me curious to see what was going on below so I decided to check how the rest of the animals drink. Hershkowitz said some of the animals were initially sceptical about the foreign object in their troughs . A commanding rhino appears to almost kiss the surface of the water after it purses its lips and takes a drink . ‘There is a massive difference in how each animal drinks. Carnivores, like lions, drink a lot like domesticated cats and dogs. Herbivores like the rhinos and zebras suck up the water with their lips.’ According to Mr Hershkowitz, some of the animals were initially sceptical about the foreign object placed at the bottom of their trough. He said they attempted to check them out by putting their hooves and paws into the water first before going to take a drink. Eventually however, they got used to the camera’s presence and drank freely. A lemur is featured in the four minute footage and delicately licks the surface of the water with its tongue . A herd of zebra humorously bare their teeth while gently sipping the water from their trough . The zookeeper also anticipated a range of reactions from the animals before the experiment and ensured that the camera was secure before it took place. ‘I was really worried the lions would bite off the GoPro, so I placed a sheet of acrylic glass above the camera,’ he said. In the clip the lion can be seen aggressively breaking the surface of the water with its tongue, and is in complete contrast to a herd of zebra, who humorously bare their teeth while gently sipping.",A zookeeper at the Zoological Center in Tel Aviv recorded the footage .

"A couple who chose to forsake their dream wedding in order to pay for one final shot at IVF are celebrating giving birth to twins and even found a way to say their 'I do's' Becca Litchfield, 29, and partner Dale, 30, from Gotham, Nottingham, were heart-broken when they discovered their savings would only be enough to cover the cost of a wedding, or fertility treatment. Desperate for a family, the couple chose to sacrifice their dream wedding and go ahead with IVF, but were over the moon when weeks later they became winners of a wedding competition. Becca and Dale Litchfield decided to give up their dream wedding in order to have one last shot at IVF and have since welcomed twins,  Darci-Mai (left) and  Stanley (right) The happy couple said their vows, and were overjoyed when they discovered the fertility treatment had worked - and Becca gave birth to twins Stanley and Darci-Mai. The full-time mother says that the couple can't believe their luck having achieved both of their dreams. 'When we realised we'd couldn't have children and get married, it was heart breaking,' she said. 'It was devastating to give up one of our dreams. We knew that we weren't getting any younger so the best option was to try IVF one last time, and sacrifice the wedding. 'It was a risk, because the IVF could have failed - and we'd have ended up with neither. 'But when we won the wedding competition, and then found out I was pregnant, it was unbelievable. Although they had given up on the idea of their perfect wedding the couple were blessed with yet another stroke of luck when they won a wedding contest which allowed them to finally get married . Before they conceived Darci-Mai (right) and Stanley (left) Becca and Dale had attempted two rounds of IVF . 'Now I've got my dream - the perfect husband and children, I couldn't be happier.' Becca and Dale, first started IVF treatment in 2012 after a year of failing to conceive naturally. The couple spent £5,500 on two rounds of IVF, keeping back an additional sum of money that they planned to spend on their wedding day. But after two failed attempts, Becca and Dale were forced to make a decision, Becca says that it was an incredibly difficult one to make. 'We were spending all of our money on IVF treatment hoping we'd conceive but after we failed twice I wondered if I'd ever get pregnant,' she said. 'We planned to use the spare money to get married but knew because of our ages we'd have to have kids now or never. 'I'd always dreamt of feeling my baby kick for the first time and the bond after giving birth, so I knew we had to try IVF one last time.' After winning the wedding competition the couple were able to have the white wedding they had always wanted . Becca, pictured with Darci-Mai (left) and Stanley (right) In order to conceive, Becca, pictured with Darci-Mai, had to take three hormone injections a day but she says it was entirely worth it . After abandoning hopes of a big celebration the couple decided to at least secure their relationship with a proposal. 'We were advised to wait for a year before trying again - I was just counting down the days,' she said. 'It felt like time was ticking away so quickly. At the end of the year, Dale and I officially became engaged - it was a way to lift our spirits and we thought if we couldn't have a big wedding, we could at least get engaged.' But unbeknownst to Becca, during their year long wait for IVF, Dale, who works as an electrician, entered the pair into a win a wedding competition. Becca says that once again fate was in their favour having initially been runners-up. Becca says that she and Dale couldn't stop beaming when they discovered they were expecting twins . 'We actually came second in the competition, but then the first place dropped out and so we won,' she said. 'We couldn't believe it - after all the heart ache and the decision making, we were getting both. 'It felt like a miracle. I'd always dreamt of a big white wedding and walking down the aisle, but I'd put that to the back of my mind. 'I couldn't believe my dreams were going to become a reality.' After the wedding, the pair changed fertility clinics and had their final round of IVF. It was here that medics discovered Becca had low hormone levels and started to treat her for the problem, giving her three hormone injections a day to increase the chance of her falling pregnant . When Becca first discovered she was pregnant she was so shocked she took four tests to make sure. She gave birth to twins Darci-Mai (left) and Stanley (right) Becca says that it was a challenging period but she was prepared to carry on in hope of having her dream family. 'I felt like a pin cushion while I was having all the treatment but knew it was worth it. 'Then after the eggs were implanted I took two weeks off work to relax and do nothing other than sit with my legs up in the hope it would help us to get pregnant. 'Then we did a pregnancy test and it was positive. We didn't want to get our hopes up but after four more tests said we were pregnant I believed it.' Overjoyed with the news Becca was then astounded to find out that she was not carrying just one baby but two. 'Once I knew I was pregnant I had a feeling we were going to have twins and when doctors confirmed it we couldn't believe it. 'When the doctor told me there were two heartbeats we were all gobsmacked. The twins were born on 27th September last year . Becca says that even when the Darci-Mai (left) and Stanley (right) are screaming she feels lucky to have them . 'Me and Dale sat beaming at each other, we couldn't believe we were about to have one baby let alone twins.' The twins were born in September last year and six months later the couple still can't quite believe their luck. Becca said: 'It's amazing to think how dramatically our life changed in one year - we got married and now have a beautiful boy and girl. 'Even now I still feel so privileged to have children - even when they are screaming I keep thinking thank goodness that they are with us. 'Before I thought of myself as very unlucky, I'd never won anything in my life. 'But since winning our wedding and having kids it still doesn't feel real. 'I've definitely used my life's worth of luck now but I don't care because I've got everything I ever dreamed of so I'm happy.

"Just a quarter of voters think David Cameron is hungriest to win the election, a poll reveals today as the Prime Minister tries to step up his campaign passion. After criticism of a dull campaign from the chillaxing PM, Mr Cameron used an interview to insist he was working 'bloody hard' to secure a majority. But only 25 per cent of people think he wants to win most, compared to 43 per cent who believe Ed Miliband is most up for the fight. Scroll down for video . Some 43 per cent of voters think Ed Miliband 'comes across as wanting to win the most' when compared to David Cameron . Opinion polls continue to suggest the result is too close to call, although two surveys yesterday put the Tories ahead, including one which gave them a six-point lead. But while Mr Cameron is frequently seen as the strongest leader when compared to Mr Miliband, voters appear to think he wants to win less. In a YouGov survey for The Times, 43 per cent of voters think Mr Miliband 'comes across as wanting to win the most' when compared to Mr Cameron. Only 25 per cent thought Mr Cameron was hungriest for the job, and 13 per cent said neither of them. Mr Cameron appeared without a tie or jacket again today at Kelvin Hughes in north London as part of a 'sleeves rolled up' strategy designed to show he is fighting hard for a Tory victory. Meanwhile, Mr Miliband is giving a speech on how a Labour government would tackle immigration. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, riding high after strong TV debate performances and a surge in the polls, was judged to be enjoying the fight more than anyone by 34 per cent of voters . Just 7 per cent also thought Mr Cameron was enjoying the campaign the most out of all the main party leaders. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, riding high after strong TV debate performances and a surge in the polls, was judged to be enjoying the fight more than anyone by 34 per cent of voters. Ukip's Nigel Farage was the second happiest leader on 16 per cent, followed by Mr Miliband on 13 per cent. In recent days senior Tories and business backers had begun to criticise the campaign, warning it was dull and suffering from a 'curious lack of energy and belief'. Former Prime Minister Sir John Major warned against relying on dry economic data, when people want to know how their lives will be better. David Cameron appeared without a tie or jacket again today at Kelvin Hughes in north London as part of a 'sleeves rolled up' strategy designed to show he is fighting hard for a Tory victory . More people think Ed Miliband is hungriest for a win and appears to be enjoying the campaign more than his Tory rival . Mr Cameron appears to have taken the criticism to heart, making a series of passionate stump speeches in the last 72 hours. After weeks of criticism that the Conservatives were running a boring campaign, the Prime Minister found the fire in his belly as he declared in London yesterday: 'If I'm getting lively about it it's because I feel bloody lively about it.' In an interview with The Times today he adds: 'The real David Cameron has been standing up and working bloody hard for the last five years. 'I'm feeling pumped up. There's ten days to go, it's a bloody important election and I'm determined to get across the line. The line is victory — and victory is a Conservative majority. I know the polls are tight but victory is doable.'",Poll shows 43% think Labour leader Ed Miliband wants to win the most . Just 7% think David Cameron is enjoying the campaign more than rivals .

"France's biggest handball star Nikola Karabatic will stand trial for fraud over his suspected involvement in an illegal betting case. Karabatic, a multiple world and Olympic gold medalist, and his younger brother Luka were among a group of players banned by the French league two years ago for betting on the result of a match in which their Montpellier club, which had already secured the title, lost to a struggling team. Karabatic's lawyer Michael Corbier told Sportsmail on Wednesday the trial will likely take place within months. French handball star Nikola Karabatic has been accused of match fixing along with 15 others . Former Montpellier ace competes for France in Handball World Cup match against Iceland in January . 'We would have preferred the charges to be thrown out, but we'll aim for a not-guilty verdict,' said Corbier. 'In theory he is facing five years in prison and a fine, but even a suspended sentence of just half an hour in jail would be too much.' Karabatic, who was briefly detained when the case emerged, now plays for Barcelona in the Spanish league. Karabatic leaves the Montpellier's courtroom after attending his appeal in October 2012 . Other former or current Montpellier players including Mladen Bojinovic, Samuel Honrubia, Dragan Gagic, Primoz Prost, Issam Tej and Mickael Robin will also be tried. Karabatic has denied placing bets on the match that Montpellier lost 31-28 to Cesson-Rennes.

Elizabeth Sedway, 51, from Granite Hill, California, posted an emotional video on her Facebook page Monday showing her family being kicked off a packed plane. Mrs Sedway, who suffers from multiple myeloma - a rare form of plasma cancer - detailed her ordeal in a status update accompanying the short video, which has been shared nearly 10,000 times as of Tuesday evening. In the message, the mother of two explained that she was sitting in the handicapped section of a boarding area at Lihue Airport on Kauai when an Alaska Airlines representative noticed she had put on a surgical mask to shield herself from germs and came up to her asking if she needed anything. Mrs Sedway initially said she was fine, but when the airline employee approached her a second time, she indicated that she might require a little extra time to board the plane because she sometimes felt 'weak.'

In Sedway's video, her husband is seen removing their carry-on luggage and helping their sons out of their seats . Brought to tears: As the family of four walk towards the exit, Elizabeth Sedway breaks down and tearfully apologizes for holding everyone up . The Sedway family eventually boarded the plane and were awaiting takeoff in their seats when an airline representative came on board and announced that the cancer-stricken passenger could not fly without a note from her doctor. In Sedway's video, her husband dressed in a brightly colored Hawaiian shirt is seen removing their carry-on luggage and helping their sons out of their seats while his wife narrates their removal from the flight. 'All these people are waiting, and I am being removed as if I'm a criminal or contagious because I have cancer,' she says. 'My family is being forcibly removed from an airplane because I have cancer and no note to fly.' As the family of four walk towards the exit, Elizabeth Sedway breaks down and tearfully apologizes for holding everyone up. One of the passengers tells the woman, 'God bless you.' In an interview with NBC Bay Area, Elizabeth Sedway said the airline was concerned she might collapse during the eight-hour flight to San Jose, California. After being asked to leave the plane, Mrs Sedway emailed her oncologist in California and he gave her the green light to fly, but she told the local NBC affiliate in a phone interview that the airline was not satisfied and refused to let her re-board. Named and shamed: Sedway shared this photo of Alaska Airline staff at Lihue Airport on her Facebook page, identifying them as the employees whom she had to deal with during the incident . Damage control: Alaska Airlines later apologized to the family for mishandling the situation . The Sedways spent Monday night in a hotel in Maui, for which they were forced to pay out of pocket, and they were scheduled to return home on a Hawaiian Airlines flight Tuesday evening. Elizabeth Sedway lamented on her Facebook page that because of the delay caused by Alaska Airlines, she will miss two chemotherapy sessions, her husband will miss important meetings and her sons will miss school. Earlier today, a spokesperson for Alaska Airlines told CBS San Francisco that the company apologized to Elizabeth Sedway for the inconvenience and for the way its employees handled the situation. ‘Her family’s tickets have been refunded and we will cover the cost of her family’s overnight accommodations in Lihue,’ Alaska spokeswoman Halley Knigge stated. ‘While our employee had the customer’s well-being in mind, the situation could have been handled differently.’","Elizabeth Sedway, 51, has rare plasma cancer and was returning to California with her husband and two children from Hawaii vacation .

"From 'here's you a piece of pizza' to 'this glass needs washed', every state has its own set of phrases that can seem bizarre to the rest of the English-speaking world. In New York, for instance, there's a tendency to use the word 'so' for drama, such as 'I'm so totally over this.' Some people in San Jose think nothing of saying 'didn't nobody help him', while Florida residents can be heard using the phrase, 'I ain't never had no trouble with none of 'em.' Click on a location marker in the map below to hear common phrases for each state . All of my clothes needs washed - Idaho . ..and wadn't anybody home but me - Alabama . Don’t none of y’all work as hard as I do - Virginia . We all use night-crawlers anymore - Iowa . I so might run this [race] with you - California . I ain't never had no trouble with none of 'em - Florida . You are so in the Doghouse for that on - New York . Twitter can be a professional job anymore - Nebraska . Now researchers at Yale University have revealed these patterns by documenting the subtle differences in sentence structure across the US. Their interactive map allows you to click on a location and see common phrases for a region, as well as its source. While the map focuses on the US, it also has a small amount of data for the UK, with sentences such as 'yer lugs needs washed' used in Scotland and 'Ne mon nule don hum no good', in Aylesbury. 'Unlike variation in phonology (often referred to as accent) and in the lexicon (different words), variation in grammatical systems within English has for the most part not been systematically investigated,' says Larry Horn, professor of linguistics and philosophy at Yale University. 'This variation may be found among speakers who live in a certain geographical region, or who belong to a certain age group, or to a particular social or ethnic group,' he adds. During the past year, members of the project have been conducting nationwide surveys using an online crowdsourcing platform asking for people's judgment on sentences. The researchers were not interested in what is considered to be correct  grammar, but in what people do naturally. As well as the map, the team has also created a comprehensive guide that lists the different types of sentence structures used. One of the most interesting discoveries  are presentative sentences like 'Here's you a water bottle.' 'That sentence just floored me,' says postdoctoral associate Jim Wood, a Yale University lecturer in linguistics. 'It seemed very alien and different to me.' The overall pattern was clear; In the South people found that sentence to be completely normal, while in the North, it was almost unheard of. From 'here's you a piece of pizza' to 'this glass needs washed', every state has its own phrases that can seem odd to the rest of the world . 'It's a reason didn't nobody help him', is a common sentence structure used in San Jose, claims the study authors at Yale University . While the map focuses on the US, it also has a small amount of data for the UK, with sentences such as 'yer lugs needs washed' used in Scotland (left) and 'Ne mon nule don hum no good', in Aylesbury. And New York isn't the only region that uses 'so' to add emphasis to a sentence. Londoners also appear to have picked up the habit (right) 'It was pretty stunning, and it turns out you can do it with ""where"" as well. ""Where's me a screwdriver?"" or ""Where's me a place to eat around here?""' he added. Other notable examples include ‘Don’t none of y’all work as hard as I do’ in Virginia; ‘we all use night-crawlers anymore’ in Iowa; and ‘I ain't never had no trouble with none of 'em’ in Florida. Meanwhile, people in New Haven sometimes use 'so don't I', such as in the sentence, 'he plays guitar, but so don't I'. Linguistics Professor Raffaella Zanuttini explained that there is also a social implication to this research. 'Often people are convinced that there is a right way of speaking a language and a wrong way of speaking that language. 'From the point of view of a linguist, that is really off the mark for many reasons,' she says. 'We linguists can see through this, because we have a more scientific approach to language,' says Zanuttini. 'We believe that creating an awareness of what we consider to be basic facts about language can have a positive social effect, by making people aware that they are expressing a negative evaluation of others.'

"Brendan Rodgers will remind Raheem Sterling of his responsibilities after the Liverpool youngster hit the headlines for the wrong reasons before scoring the opener in a 2-0 win over Newcastle United. Sterling, who is unwilling to sign a new contract at Anfield, has been videoed passing out after allegedly inhaling nitrous oxide, also known as 'hippy crack', and on Sunday was pictured puffing on a shisha pipe.

"Internet users were left scratching their heads after an old hoax video showing a wave rider surfing in front of the Sydney's Opera House started trending for a second time.

Some users have referenced the weather as the trigger of the strange phenomenon, with musician Fortafy uploading the video with the following caption: 'storm brings out surfers in Sydney Harbour.' The video was originally posted by Sydneysider Darren Johnson following strong storms and tandem heavy swells in June 2012. YouTube commenters were quick to point out inaccuracies in the video, such as the appearance of rocks around the Opera House and the cardboard-esque appearance of the man in the final shot. It was also rebutted by several wave experts who vowed it was a sham. Ben Macartney, a swell forecaster, told News.com 'the only way you'd get waves in there would be a giant tsunami coming out of the Pacific.' 'Even the most powerful ocean waves known to man, I think, would still really struggle to make it up there.'

"We all need a helping hand sometimes, and nobody more so than Kecil the baby orangutan, who had a tough start to life after his natural mother and another surrogate mother rejected him. But the one-year-old ape found love at the third time of asking with second surrogate mother Maggie at Chicago's Brookfield Zoo, and has today been pictured cuddling up to the experienced mother ahead of his first public outing this weekend. Maggie, 53, who has already raised one surrogate child, has proved herself yet again by helping to raise Kecil (pronounced Ka-cheel) for the past 10 months, and the two now have an inseparable bond. Scroll down for video . Taking care: Maggie, 53, wraps a protective arm around Kecil the baby orangutan who she has been raising for the past ten months after his mother and a surrogate mother both rejected him . Inseparable: Zookeepers were nervous that Maggie might reject Kecil after raising four of her own children and another surrogate which was given to her in 2002, but she has proved her parenting prowess once again . When the pair appeared in front of news crews earlier today, Kecil began crying after losing sight of Maggie for a few moments. But the elder orangutan quickly returned, at which point Kecil quietened down and scooted over to join her, reports the Chicago Sun Times. Kecil had to be moved from his birthplace at Toledo zoo, in Ohio, 14 months ago after his natural mother failed to bond with him properly after birth. He was moved to Milwaukee County Zoo and given to a second surrogate, but she did not form a bond with him either. In a final attempt to find a parent for Kecil, he was handed over to Maggie, the oldest orangutan in North America, who has already raised four children of her own, and a fifth surrogate which was given to her in 2002. The pair immediately showed signs of intimacy, but zookeepers still faced a tense wait to see if the elderly orangutan would take on full parental duties. Nava Greenblatt, one of the zoo’s lead primate keepers, said that the turning point came when a fire alarm sounded at the zoo a few weeks ago, frightening Kecil, who ran to Maggie and cuddle up to her. Turning point: Keepers in Chicago said the turning point for Kecil came a few weeks ago when a fire alarm went off on the zoo, frightening him. Usually he turned to people for comfort, but instead he ran and cuddled up to Maggie . Big day: After settling into his new enclosure, Kecil will go on display for the first time this weekend in two hours slots between 10am and midday, allowing him to nap in the afternoons . Getting into the swing of things: Keepers said when Kecil and Maggie were first put into their new enclosure, the older ape would wander too far ahead, and Kecil would get lost, but the pair have now learned to stick close to one another . She said: 'Initially when he would be feeling insecure he would turn to people, and then there was a shift where he would turn to Maggie if he felt insecure. That was a big milestone. He really needs her to learn how to be an orangutan.' The pair will eventually become part of an exhibit featuring the zoo's four other orangutans, but at the moment they are living in isolation, as would be the case in the wild. Kecil will be on display on Saturday and Sunday at Brookfield Zoo's Tropic World Asia enclosure between 10am and midday. The other orangutans will be allowed into the enclosure around those times to help them acclimatise as well. Hanging out: The pair will eventually become part of an exhibit featuring the zoo's four other orangutans, but at the moment they are living in isolation, as would be the case in the wild .

"Listening to The Beatles could help to enhance the enjoyment of a fish and chip supper, psychologists have found. Research suggests that certain types of music can bring out specific flavours - including sweet, salty and bitter - in a range of foods. The intensity of Nessun Dorma, performed by Luciano Pavarotti, is said to be the perfect accompaniment to dark mouse or coffee. Meanwhile, the high-pitched piano in Billie Holiday's Autumn in New York can help emphasise the autumnal flavour of a pumpkin pudding. Listening to the right sort of music, including the Beatles (pictured) can enhance flavours in certain food and drink, researchers have found . In the Ultraviolent restaurant in Shanghai, fish and chips (pictured) are served up to a backdrop of the Beatles . In Ultraviolent restaurant in Shanghai, fish and chips are served up to a backdrop of the Beatles, while in El Celler de Can Roca in Girona, Spain, scented meringue comes with a commentary describing Barcelona footballer Lionel Messi in action, a clip which apparently brings out the citrus flavours in the dessert. The so-called digital seasoning also applies to wine, helping drinkers to enjoy their tipple by up to 15 per cent more, if served alongside the right music. Researchers found people enjoyed their wine more while listening to 'paired' music, rather than while being sat in silence. Tchaikovsky's String Quartet No 1 in D Major particularly compliments Chateau Margaux 2004, while Mozart's Flute Quartet in D Major should be played while drinking Puilly-Fume. Professor Charles Spence, a behavioral psychologist from Oxford University, told the Observer's Neil Tweedle that taste is not as dominant as we might think in judging a meal and that our ears might subconsciously talk to our tastebuds. He said: 'Music cannot create taste or flavours that are not there in your mouth, but it can draw attention to certain notes in a wine or food that are competing in your mind... It's kind of digital seasoning.' The deep tones of Luciano Pavarotti (pictured left) singing Nessun Dorma can enhance the bitterness in coffee and the intensity in a chocolate mousse (pictured right) Mr Spence added that humans tend to match the same sounds to the same tastes. He described sourness as 'high-pitched', meaning it should be played alongside music of the same quality. He also said sweetness is associated with richer sounds, while bitterness is linked to deeper tones. He believes the sound associated with salty - which he has not yet pinned down - would be enhanced by a throbbing type of sound. 'Bitter, sweet, sour - we have those,' says Professor Charles Spence, 'But salty is the hardest taste to embody in sound.' To carry out his research, Mr Spence gives people two pieces of identical chocolate and asks them to each eat one while listening to a different piece of classical music. While the more sombre music is played, people generally describe the chocolate as more bitter. When they described the chocolate as 'sweet', it generally when the more upbeat piece was being played, he said. Heston Blumenthal, who runs the Fat Duck in Bray, Berkshire, is among restaurateurs who have sought the professor's advice. Mr Spence said that, as well as music, colour and even the weight of cutlery are factors which can combine to make a dining experience more enjoyable. Ambient lighting was found to have a positive effect on a person's enjoyment, with red light bringing out the fruitiness in red wine.",Research suggests certain types of music can bring out specific flavours .

The images were inspired by a debate that saw Mr Miliband warned he would not get into power without lurching left, as Miss Sturgeon told him he is ‘not strong enough’ to win power on his own.

"Greece has denied it will fail to pay a multi-million pound loan following reports it has drawn up plans to introduce parallel drachma currency to pay domestic bills. The country is due to repay a £330million loan to the International Monetary Fund on Thursday but there were concerns the heavily indebted nation would default on the payment. Deputy finance minister Dimitris Mardas said that Greece will in fact make the payment on time. Greece has denied it will miss a repayment of £330million to the International Monetary Fund after reports it had drawn up plans to introduce a parallel drachma currency to pay its bills . He said: 'We strive to be able to pay our obligations on time. We are ready to pay on April 9.' Sources close to the ruling Syriza party claimed the government was prioritising paying wages and pensions over any loans due, according to the Telegraph. It  reported that the nation no longer has the funds to repay the debt unless the eurozone agrees to pay the next portion of its interim bail-out deal in time. A senior official told the newspaper: 'We are a Left-wing government. If we have to choose between a default to the IMF or a default to our own people, it is a no-brainer. 'We may have to go into a silent arrears process with the IMF. This will cause a furore in the markets and means that the clock will start to tick much faster.' German magazine Der Spiegel quoted . a finance ministry general secretary, Nikos Theocharakis, as . saying Greece would probably not pay next week's IMF tranche, . prompting a further denial from the Greek finance ministry. Theocharakis said Greece would be 'close to the end' on . April 9 and called the technical teams from its creditors . 'completely useless,' according to an extract of the article due . to be published on Saturday. 'Mr. Theocharakis never characterised the technical teams of . the institutions with the phrase attributed to him,' the . ministry said in a statement. 'On the contrary ... he referred . to them as saying they include 'top-notch people with impressive . skills.'' Deputy finance minister Dimitris Mardas (pictured) said that Greece will in fact make the payment on time . Germany's Spiegel Online quoted Belgian Finance Minister . Johan Van Overtveldt as saying that Greece postponing the . repayment due on April 9 was 'out of the question', otherwise a . Greek exit from the eurozone could no longer be ruled out.

"(CNN)Roseanne Barr revealed earlier this week that she is going blind. In an interview with The Daily Beast, the 62-year-old comic talked about her struggle with macular degeneration and glaucoma — two eye diseases that get progressively worse over time and can steal vision. Barr's doctors haven't provided a timeline, but her symptoms are worsening: ""My vision is closing in now,"" she said. ""I just try and enjoy vision as much as possible. Y'know, living it up."" Related: 9 worst eye care mistakes you're making . Macular degeneration is a breakdown of the part of the retina that allows us to see fine details in the center of vision; while glaucoma damages the nerve that connects the retina to the brain, and is often caused by fluid build-up and pressure in the eyes. (Barr said in the interview that she helps relieve the pressure by using marijuana, which is known to temporarily lower pressure inside the eye.) ""It's somewhat unusual that Roseanne Bar has both, but not unheard of,"" explains ophthalmologist Steven A. Shanbom, MD, of Shanbom Eye Specialists in Berkley, Mich. Though there are some controllable risk factors, certain people are genetically predisposed to these diseases, so Barr may simply be prone to both. ""Certainly it's sad. The combination of the two is terrible. Macular degeneration takes away her central vision, and glaucoma is taking away her peripheral vision,"" Dr. Shanbom adds. (He is not treating Roseanne Barr, and does not know the specifics of her case.) The risk for both diseases goes up for everyone after age 60, with some people, especially African Americans, at higher risk in their 40s. That's why the American Academy of Opthalmology recommends getting a baseline eye exam when you turn the big 4-0, even if you have perfect vision. In the early stages, you can have either condition, but have no symptoms at all. Things like a family history or high blood pressure, or issues within the eye (like having a thinner cornea, for example) might lead your MD to prescribe drops that can reduce your chances of developing glaucoma by about half. Related: 10 natural ways to lower blood pressure . There is no cure for either disease. But like those eyedrops, there are treatments that may delay the progression of early-stage glaucoma (from other drugs to surgery), and therapies that might halt further vision loss in advanced cases of macular degeneration (including an implantable telescope). The future looks brighter however: An animal study published this month suggests that an injection of stem cells into the eye might slow or even reverse the effects of early-stage macular degeneration. There are also simple things you can start doing right now to ward off these diseases. Here, five ways to protect your peepers. Slip on your shades—even when it's cloudy . Sun exposure can up the risk for glaucoma and macular degeneration, as well as cataracts (clouding of the lenses). Make sure your sunglasses offer 99% to 100% UV protection. Sporting a pair that doesn't filter UV light is more dangerous than wearing no shades at all, because the dark lenses cause your pupils to dilate and allow in more harmful rays. Schedule in a regular walk . Studies indicate that aerobic exercise can reduce the eye pressure that leads to glaucoma, and may improve blood flow to the retina and optic nerve. According to the Glaucoma Research Foundation, all you need to do is raise your pulse 20% to 25% (which could mean a brisk walk) for 20 minutes, a minimum of four times a week. Related: 9 tweaks that make walking workouts more effective . Eat your greens . Spinach, kale, and other leafy greens are packed with lutein and zeaxanthin—antioxidants that lower your risk of developing macular degeneration (and cataracts too), research shows. Another good source: egg yolks. Snack on almonds, citrus, and berries . Almonds are loaded with vitamin E (a handful provides about half your daily dose), which slows macular degeneration; while citrus fruit and berries are filled with vitamin C, which cuts your odds of developing the disease. Avoid cigarette smoke . While smoking is bad news for many parts of your body, you may not have considered eyes to be one of them. However, smoking doubles your risk of macular degeneration. Avoiding cigs can not only protect your lungs and heart, it can protect your peepers too.","Barr has macular degeneration and glaucoma, eye diseases that get progressively worse and can steal vision .

"Landlord: Despite attacking right to buy, Emily Thornberry has three homes . A senior Labour politician was under fire last night for attacking right to buy – while renting out a property she bought from a housing association. Emily Thornberry has come out against David Cameron’s pledge to extend the right to buy policy from council tenants to those in housing association homes. But eight years ago she and her husband bought at auction a housing association property now worth almost £1million. Tories said Miss Thornberry, who lost her frontbench job after tweeting a sneering picture of a house covered in England flags and with a white van outside, opposed right to buy but not ‘right to buy to let’. ‘This hypocrisy goes right to the heart of Ed Miliband’s Islington-based, out-of-touch Labour Party,’ said Henry Smith, who is seeking re-election as Conservative MP for Crawley. ‘They speak out against plans that help the aspirations of hardworking people on days when it’s politically useful.’ Housing association chiefs have also been accused of hypocrisy for drawing huge salaries and living in mansions while wishing to deny tenants a foot on the property ladder. Ruth Davison, of the National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, has a£1million home in fashionable Islington, north London. Miss Thornberry yesterday retweeted an article from the federation attacking right to buy. And, in a question-and-answer session last week, the Labour candidate for Islington South and Finsbury criticised the policy directly. She said: ‘I don’t have a problem per se with people being able to buy their council flat or council house, so long as it is replaced like for like. 'And that’s what the problem has been. There has been a massive sell-off but they have not been replaced.’ Council house tenants in England can already buy their home at a discount of up to £103,900. The Tories would extend this to 800,000 housing association tenants who now have limited purchase rights and to 500,000 who have no rights at all. Around 2.7million people live in these properties. The subsidies would be funded by making councils sell their more costly properties when they become vacant. Each would be replaced on a one-for-one basis. The picture that cost Miss Thornberry her job as shadow attorney general was taken during the Rochester by-election, which was won by Ukip. The case highlighted just how much high-value property Miss Thornberry owned. Costly tweet: Emily Thornberry lost her frontbench job after tweeting this picture, with the sneering caption 'Image from #Rochester' while on the campaign trail in Medway, Kent . She lives with her husband, high court judge Sir Christopher Nugee, in a four-storey Victorian townhouse on an exclusive crescent in Barnsbury, north London, worth almost £3million. Emily Thornberry was forced to resign from the shadow cabinet in November after sneering at a home with St George’s flags hung outside and a white van on the drive. She said she had ‘never seen anything like it’ after tweeting a photo of the terraced home while on the campaign trail for the Rochester and Strood by-election in Kent. The then-shadow attorney general, who lives in a £3million north London house, wrote mockingly alongside the photo: ‘Image from Rochester.’ At first she tried to defend her remarks but was told to quit within hours of the tweet. The home’s owner, cage fighter Dan Ware, 37, branded her a ‘snob’. Speaking at the time, leader Ed Miliband said: ‘Respect is a basic rule of politics and I’m afraid her tweet conveyed a sense of disrespect.’ Miss Thornberry also owns a £600,000 flat in Guildford, Surrey, which she bought for her mother in 2000. In March 2007, her husband bought the housing association property in Finsbury at auction for £572,000. The three-storey townhouse was bought from Ujima, a housing association catering largely for ethnic minority tenants, which went bust just months later. It is now let. The fact a housing association sells a property does not necessarily mean social housing stock has fallen. They could use the cash to build in a cheaper area. During part of her childhood, Miss Thornberry lived in a council house. At the age of seven, her parents divorced and she and her two younger brothers moved into social housing with their mother. Labour politicians continued to attack the right to buy extension yesterday. David Lammy, a potential London mayoral candidate, tweeted: ‘Extending right to buy is one of the most senseless and irresponsible pledges ever made by a British political party.’ Last night a YouGov poll for the Policy Exchange think-tank suggested 50 per cent back extended right to buy. Housing fat cat who hates right to buy is a Labour supporter with £1m home . Hypocrite? Ruth Davison, leading critic of David Cameron's plan to extent the right to buy scheme is a Labour party member and the owner of a £1million house in Islington, London . The leading critic of Conservative Party plans to give housing association tenants a right to buy herself lives in a £1million house. As director of policy and external affairs at the National Housing Federation, Ruth Davison has been leading the campaign to prevent millions of people getting a real chance of owning their own homes. But just as she did not advertise the fact that she is a member of her local Labour party in Islington, North London, neither has she revealed just how comfortable her own house is. In reality she has been one of the country’s biggest gainers from the private property boom. She also earned hefty salaries in public bodies for years when Labour was in power. Miss Davison, 44, and husband Chris Bailey, 47, who describes himself as an ‘urban regenerator, non-profit board member and social entrepreneur’, bought a large terrace house in Islington for £440,000 ten years ago. It has now rocketed to more than £1million in value. Yet on behalf of the fat-cat housing association bosses she speaks for, Miss Davison has been across the newspapers and broadcasters this week fighting to stop the Conservative election campaign proposal to extend ‘right to buy’ legislation from council house tenants to the 2.7million people living in housing association properties. Under the scheme, housing association tenants would receive discounts of tens of thousands of pounds on the market value of their homes. Miss Davison told the BBC in response to the Tory right-to-buy plans on Tuesday that it was wrong to effectively give money to ‘some of the most securely housed people in the country on some of the lowest rents’. She added: ‘We are independent organisations and charities – you can no more force a housing association to sell their assets at less than they’re worth than you can force Tesco, or even Cancer Research. So housing associations would have to be fully recompensed for any sale. There will be a cost to the taxpayer.’ Miss Davison’s first major taxpayer-funded role under Labour was at the Audit Commission, with other senior roles at Bedford and Hertfordshire Strategic Health Authority and the National Patient Safety Agency. Last night Miss Davison said: ‘The price of a family house is now beyond the reach of many – I couldn’t afford to buy my home now. ‘We need to build more homes of all types to make housing more affordable for everyone, not just give money away to the lucky few.’","Emily Thornberry has criticised Conservative 'right-to-buy' policy .

"(CNN)One war was enough for Gregory Margolin. Now 87 years old, he was a 16-year-old Jewish recruit when he fought in the Soviet Red Army. As he fought the Nazis in World War II, his family fled. ""I did not show that I was Jewish,"" Margolin says. ""But it did not matter because people were being killed left and right. All around me."" This year, in Ukraine, he found himself again surrounded by war. Margolin was a sniper who rose to be a commander in the army. His old uniform is still adorned with medals from his time in the military. His granddaughter Liora still marvels at his stories from the war. She is amazed that he managed to survive. Suffering from Alzheimer's disease, a degenerative condition that impairs memory, he struggles to remember his own life sometimes, but he remembers the horrors of war. His eyes slowly shift back and forth as he seeks the right word. Or perhaps the right memory. His hands shake ever so slightly. It seems he knows he has lived a life. He is just trying to remember all the details. ""People were hiding in shelters under the ground,"" Liora says of the stories Margolin once told. ""They were being shot at point blank range. It was terrible."" ""[The Nazis] would have erased us from the Earth,"" Margolin remembers. ""They attacked us and we fought back."" After the war, Margolin settled in Donetsk in Eastern Ukraine. His family grew. He built a life. Then, decades later, he found himself in the middle of a war once again. ""A missile fell and the house was destroyed. We were attacked,"" Margolin says. ""A missile fell. I remember."" Margolin's family lived in a neighborhood next to the Donetsk airport, near some of the most intense fighting in Eastern Ukraine as pro-Russian separatists battled the Ukrainian army. Margolin, who had survived one war, was able to survive another, even as the stray missile hit his house on February 10. It spared him, but it killed his daughter Ira. ""The moment it happened, we decided that's it. Here and now, we're moving to Israel,"" says Liora. ""This is the safest place."" Margolin arrived in Israel on March 24. Asked why the family waited to leave the war-torn region of Eastern Ukraine, Liora says they felt they would be fine in Donetsk, while Liora prayed for their safety from Israel. ""No matter how much we're afraid of the next war here and as much as it's not quiet here, it is the quietest place."" Margolin came over in a wave of Ukrainian Jewish immigration to Israel that coincided with the beginning of hostilities in Eastern Ukraine. The International Fellowship of Christians and Jews, an organization that works to build interfaith understanding and support for Israel, has brought 600 Jews to Israel since December, Margolin among them. Rabbi Yechiel Eckstein, the fellowship's founder, says, ""We set up a refugee center. It's the first time since the Holocaust that the Jewish world has had to set up a refugee center for these Jews who are fleeing and have nowhere to go."" Among the Ukrainian Jews moving to Israel, Eckstein says they have worked with approximately a dozen Holocaust survivors. On Yom HaShoah, Israel's Holocaust Remembrance Day that commemorates the Nazi extermination of 6 million Jews, these stories of survival reverberate with a renewed energy. Jews who struggled to survive once find themselves fleeing to survive now. ""Most of the [Jewish] people in the Ukraine are Holocaust survivors or children of Holocaust survivors. These are the people who made it, who are able to flee or come back or to stay or to somehow survive the Holocaust."" Margolin was one of these people, able to survive the Holocaust as a soldier in the Soviet Army. His story can be difficult for him to remember sometimes, but it is impossible for his family to forget.

"Britain was hailed as a ‘job-creating machine’ last night as the number of people in work soared to its highest level in history. The Conservatives’ economic strategy also won a stunning international endorsement, with the International Monetary Fund lavishing praise on Chancellor George Osborne. Employment rose above 31million in the three months to February, official figures showed – 557,000 higher than a year before. The Conservatives’ economic strategy  won a stunning international endorsement, with the International Monetary Fund lavishing praise on Chancellor George Osborne (pictured) David Cameron said the Conservatives had overseen a ‘jobs miracle’ and Britain had created more jobs in the last five years than the rest of the EU put together. ‘There are now two million more people in work than in 2010,’ the Prime Minister said. The encouraging numbers came as Rolls-Royce announced its biggest-ever order, worth more than £6billion, to power passenger jets for the Middle Eastern airline Emirates. IMF chief Christine Lagarde and German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble praised Mr Osborne’s ‘wonderful job’ of handling the economy. In a blow to Labour, which has opposed most of the Government’s austerity measures, Mrs Lagarde said the Government had provided the ‘right balance’ of spending cuts and tax rises. The plan had reduced the deficit from a record £153billion under Labour in 2009-10 to £90billion last year. She said she had ‘no doubt that can continue to be the case in the future’ under Mr Osborne’s plans to return Britain to the black in 2018-19, a pledge Labour has failed to match. David Cameron said the Conservatives had overseen a ‘jobs miracle’ and Britain had created more jobs in the last five years than the rest of the EU put together . ‘The fiscal deficit has been significantly reduced over the last few years,’ said Mrs Lagarde. ‘Added to that it is clearly also delivering results. It is obvious that what is happening in the UK has actually worked.’ Mr Schaeuble said he was ‘full of respect’ for what the Chancellor has achieved and delivered what amounted to a highly unusual endorsement of the Tories. ‘The UK and the UK economy has done a wonderful job in the last couple of years,’ he said. ‘The UK and George Osborne has a very good plan for the future. I am very much in favour of what has been achieved and what has been forecast.’ The Chancellor, speaking at the spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank in Washington, said the UK ‘is one of the brightest spots in the world economy at the moment’. ‘I am here representing the UK with an economy that is firmly on course – the deficit halved as a share of GDP, strong growth, record high employment, record low inflation,’ he said. Greece poses the biggest threat to the global economy and the deepening crisis could hit Britain, George Osborne warned yesterday. Fears are mounting that the recession-battered country will default on its debts and be forced to leave the eurozone, creating an economic and political earthquake. The Chancellor (pictured with IMF managing director Christine Lagarde) said the crisis in Greece had made the mood at International Monetary Fund talks in Washington this week ‘notably more gloomy’ The Chancellor said the crisis in Greece had made the mood at International Monetary Fund talks in Washington this week ‘notably more gloomy’. Mr Osborne added: ‘It is clear that a misstep or miscalculation on either side [in Greece] could easily return European economies to the type of perilous situation we saw three to four years ago. ‘It would be a mistake to think that the UK could be immune to a return to this instability in European financial systems and the European economy.’ ‘The British economy is a job-creating machine and we have set out, as a Conservative Party, plans to go on creating jobs, two million further jobs, in the next parliament.’ Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander hailed Britain as the ‘job-creation powerhouse of the western economies’. The Rolls-Royce deal means the Derby-based firm will make the engines for 50 of Emirates’ Airbus A380 planes from its UK factories, where it employs 24,500 people. Emirates’ use of the A380 is said to have created 7,000 UK jobs. Rolls-Royce has worked with Emirates since 1996 but this is the first time it has made engines for the Gulf carrier’s super-jumbo fleet. Labour was forced to welcome the latest employment figures, but Ed Miliband insisted that ‘too often jobs in our country are low-paid, low-skilled and insecure’. ‘It is not just about zero-hours contracts. Young people have done badly, with growing debt, an insecure job and owning a home a distant dream,’ he said. Ed Miliband (pictured) has insisted that ‘too often jobs in our country are low-paid, low-skilled and insecure’ But John Philpott, director of the Jobs Economist website, said two-thirds of the new jobs were full-time and ‘almost all’ were permanent. In more good news, yesterday’s figures showed the unemployment rate has also fallen to pre-crisis levels of 5.6 per cent. It was last this low in June 2008. Wages excluding bonuses are also rising at 1.8 per cent – the highest level since 2012, the Office for National Statistics revealed.

"The British Veterinary Association has withdrawn its support for the shooting of free-running badgers in controversial pilot culls. The two four-year pilot culls in Somerset and Gloucestershire should be completed by trapping the badgers in cages and then shooting them, says the BVA. It concluded that the first two years of culling had not demonstrated conclusively that ‘controlled shooting’ of free-running badgers could be effective and humane. The two four-year pilot culls in Somerset and Gloucestershire should be completed by trapping the badgers in cages and then shooting them, says the BVA . The BVA said it still supported badger culling to tackle tuberculosis in cattle. Animal welfare campaigners welcomed the news but said the BVA’s ongoing support for cage-trapping and shooting was ‘regrettable’. It comes after the Environment Secretary promised to roll out more culls across the country if the Tories win the election. Addressing the National Farmers Union conference in February, Liz Truss said 'any future Conservative government' would push ahead with 'a wider roll-out of the culls', which have been fiercely criticised by wildlife groups. Her comments came as NFU president Meurig Raymond said the incidence of TB had decreased on farms in two pilot areas in Somerset and Gloucestershire where culling of badgers has taken place over the last two years. The Environment Secretary promised to roll out more culls across the country if the Tories win the election . He urged politicians not to make the controversial cull 'a party political issue' in the run-up to the general election, and criticised Labour for pledging to give up on culling. Ms Truss pledged that any future Conservative government would 'take the difficult decisions to deal with this disease'. She told the conference: 'It is shameful that under the previous government bovine TB increased nine-fold and we ended up with the highest levels of the disease in Europe. 'It is incredible that they would like to make the same mistake again.' She said the Government's strategy included cattle movement controls, vaccination in 'edge' areas around disease hotspots, and culling where the disease is rife. 'We will not let up, whatever complaints we get from protest groups. We're in it for the long haul. We will not walk away,' she said to the conference, to applause from farmers. In Gloucestershire just 274 badgers were culled in the second year of the pilot, falling far short of the minimum 615 estimated to be needed to deliver reductions in TB in livestock, leading the chief vet to admit the benefits of the cull might not be realised there. The Government claimed the low numbers in Gloucestershire reflected the 'challenges of extensive unlawful protest and intimidation' by anti-cull campaigners. In Somerset, where the other pilot cull has been carried out, a sufficient number of badgers were killed this year to lead to expected reductions in TB in cattle, with 341 culled, in a required range of 316 to 785.",British Veterinary Association has withdrawn its support of pilot culls .

"Koby Hodder, suffered a cardiac arrest and collapsed in the school playground when he was 10 . A 10-year-old boy nearly died after suffering a cardiac arrest in the school playground. Koby Hodder's heart stopped for a staggering 12 minutes after he collapsed while running around with friends during the morning break. He was playing British Bulldog – a game in which children run from one side of a playing field to another without being caught by one of the ‘bulldogs’, who often employ forceful tactics to trap runners, including rugby tackling opponents to the ground. Teachers across the country have called for the game to be banned, claiming it is dangerous and leads to children becoming injured. In the middle of playing the game, Koby suffered a cardiac arrest. This is where the electrical activity of the heart becomes so chaotic that it stops pumping and quivers or ‘fibrillates’ instead. His heart suddenly stopped beating blood around his body and he collapsed and lost consciousness. The 10-year-old was later diagnosed with the same heart condition as footballer Fabrice Muamba, a former Bolton Wanderers  player who collapsed after suffering a cardiac arrest during the first half of Bolton's FA Cup quarter-final against Tottenham in 2012. Mr Muamba was 'effectively dead' for 78 minutes and had to be shocked 15 times before his heart restarted. Teachers at Koby’s school in Doncaster, were able to give Koby CPR until paramedics arrived and saved his life. His father, Mark, 45, got a call from the school at around 11am on March 2, and was told to get to the school immediately. He said: 'I was working around the corner so I was able to get straight over there and when I saw Koby on the ground I knew he was dead. 'Teachers were giving him CPR but I could see he was grey and lifeless. I couldn't even go to him. I was devastated.' Luckily he was brought back to life when paramedics Lee Murphy and Martin Parkinson and emergency care assistant Freddie Stevens arrived, and were able to save him by giving Koby two shocks with a defibrillator. A cardiac arrest happens when the heart stops pumping blood around your body. The most common cause of a cardiac arrest is a life threatening abnormal heart rhythm called ventricular fibrillation (VF). Ventricular fibrillation happens when the electrical activity of your heart becomes so chaotic that the heart stops pumping and quivers or 'fibrillates' instead. Someone who is having a cardiac arrest will suddenly lose consciousness and will stop breathing or stop breathing normally. Unless immediately treated by CPR this always leads to death within minutes. It is possible to survive and recover from a cardiac arrest, with the right treatment. Ventrivular fibrillation - which causes an arrest - can sometimes be corrected by giving an electric shock through the chest wall, by using a device called a defibrillator. Source: British Heart Foundation . Koby, who turned 11 two weeks ago, was rushed to Doncaster Royal Infirmary, where he seemed to be making a recovery. Just as he seemed to be improving, he suffered another attack, and was transferred to Leeds General Infirmary Paediatric Intensive Care Unit. Mr Hodder, a builder and father-of-three, said: 'We were beside ourselves with worry. 'Koby is super-fit, he plays football three times a week and goes boxing two times a week. ‘How could this happen in someone so young?’ Koby’s mother, Joanne Hodder, 43, added: 'Can you imagine what we were going through? 'We didn't even have a clue what had happened to Koby. ‘We didn't think for a moment that he could have had a heart problem. 'I had dropped him off to school that morning and he was his happy little self. ‘We had no warning. Koby is a bit of a joker so when he collapsed even his friends thought he was messing around, until they noticed he wasn't breathing.' While Koby was in hospital doctors fitted him with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) to shock his heart back into rhythm should it ever stop again. Muamba, 26, was fitted with the same implant after his high profile collapse three years ago. Mr Hodder said: 'At the moment we don't know what has caused Koby to have a heart problem. It is baffling.' Koby, who is now 11, suffered a series of cardiac arrests, where the heart suddenly stops pumping blood around the body, and was treated in intensive care . Koby had a device fitted to his heart which will shock it back into beating if it ever stops again. He is pictured in hospital with boxer Josh Warrington . Mr and Mrs Hodder are due to have tests to see if Koby's heart condition is hereditary. His brother and sister, Joel, 27, and Courteney, 20, may also have to be tested. Mrs Hodder, said: 'I cannot thank each and every person who played a part in saving Koby's life and helped with his recovery, enough. 'Teachers, paramedics and hospital staff have all been amazing. 'As a parent it is your worst nightmare to receive a phone call like I did from school, when you sent your healthy 10-year-old child there fit and well that morning. 'Doctors have said that the fact that Koby was running around at the time of the attack may have helped him - because it meant his heart was pumping.' Koby knows he is lucky to be alive, but his dream of being a professional footballer has been taken from him. Koby had played with both Leeds United and Doncaster Rovers youth teams and dreamed of playing for his beloved Leeds United when he got older. Mr Hodder said: 'Doctors have said he can play with friends as long as he doesn't exert himself too much. ‘They've said that if he can exercise and talk at the same time then that's okay, but playing professionally is out of the question. Koby suffered from the same heart condition as Fabrice Muamba, a Bolton Wanderers football player who collapsed after a cardiac arrest during the first half of Bolton's FA Cup quarter-final against Tottenham . 'Maybe Koby would not have been a professional footballer but he is gutted, understandably.' Mrs Hodder said: 'When Koby feels down we tell him that he is very lucky to be here and that makes him feel better. 'But he is still recovering and sometimes he feels scared, but he is still getting used to his defibrillator. It's a big thing he has had to deal with. 'For his birthday he didn't want a sleepover as we had originally planned, instead we went for a day out to York. 'Koby has come a long way and even returned to school this month. 'He's had a fantastic recovery so far, which is all down to the fast response from the school staff and the paramedics. 'He's doing better than we could have ever imagined. I am so grateful we still have our little boy with us.'

"A hospital in Western Australia is in hot water after blood and bone fragments were found on supposedly sanitised medical instruments. The $2 billion Fiona Stanley Hospital in southwest Perth was stripped of its medical service provider Serco after they failed to return sterilising equipment by an arranged date in February. The company was fined $60,000 and was subject to Department of Health workers auditing its staff, but the hospital has been found of continuing to operate with poorly sanitised instruments, reports ABC. The $2 billion Fiona Stanley Hospital in southwest Perth was found to have blood and bone fragments of some its medical instruments . Australian Medical Association WA president Michael Gannon said some of the instruments were found to contain blood and human matter. 'There's been reports of bits of bone on some orthopaedic equipment, there's been reports, that are really hard to believe, of blood still being seen on some instruments,' he said. 'So this gives us great concerns. We've been told the problem's been fixed and this would suggest that it hasn't. Dr Gannon said the latest revelations will further damage the hospitals public image, generating a loss of morale within its workforce.

"A pair of British expats say they are ‘trapped’ in southern Spain amid an ongoing legal battle with the local town hall over a luxury bed and breakfast they once operated. Patrick and Valerie Jubb are attempting to sell the four-bedroom property where they currently reside in Jimena de la Frontera, but it is now on the brink of being torn down. The retired couple told Spain’s Olive Press news website that they have done nothing wrong but face losing the estate over illegal additions made by a previous owner. Patrick and Valerie Jubb are locked in a dispute with the town hall over alterations made by a previous owner . The Jubbs purchased the bed and breakfast in Jimena de la Frontera, in southern Spain, in 2008 . Patrick, 64, told the news website: ‘We are in absolute pieces over this. ‘All we want is to go back to the UK to be with our family and friends, but we can’t. All our money is tied up in the property.’ Patrick, a former engineer from London, and his 63-year-old wife, Valerie, bought the bed and breakfast, La Vina de Linan, in 2008 and closed it a year ago as they moved forward with plans to sell it. They said they had a deal in place to sell the estate for €680,000, but the town hall ruled that the first floor, kitchen and pool were illegally built by previous owners in 1994. The Jubbs said they obtained a certificate that stated there were no infractions when they bought the estate . When the Jubbs tried to sell the town hall ruled that the alterations, including a swimming pool, were illegal . The Jubbs told the Olive Press that the Junta provided a certificate stating there were no planning infractions when they bought the property, and that the alterations were legalised by land registry officials in 2005 – three years before they acquired the estate. In most situations the local authority loses the right to demolish a house that has been illegally altered if it fails to detect the alterations within four years. But in the case of the Jubbs the usual rule does not apply because the property is located inside Los Alcornocales Natural Park in the Andalusian province of Cadiz. Patrick and Valerie Jubb are planning to move back to the UK, but said their money is tied up in the property . Patrick said the alterations never should have been approved in the first place.

"A 3-year-old's recurring nightmare about a mysterious white van may help shed light on what really happened the day her mother died in an SUV crash that Virginia police have ruled a tragic accident. Natali Castellanos-Tyler, 30, a married mother of three from Chesterfield County, was returning home from a birthday party February 21 with her daughter, Elisa, in the backseat when she supposedly slid off a rain-soaked road, slammed her silver Ford Explorer into a tree and died at the scene. Investigators concluded that the crash was a one-car collision that was caused by poor road conditions. Scroll down for video . Loss: Natali Castellanos-Tyler, 30, pictured with her husband, Craig, and their two children, was killed in an SUV crash in Virginia two months ago to the day . Deadly impact: Castellanos-Tyler was just a few miles from her home when her 2002 Ford Explorer ran off the road in the 15400 block of Genito Road and careened into a tree . Accident: Police said the crash was a one-car collision caused by a rain-soaked road . Elisa Tyler emerged from the accident largely unscathed, but according to her father, Craig Tyler, the little girl has been plagued by disturbing nightmares and daytime visions about the accident. 'She’ll just start walking and she’ll start screaming, ""The van, the white van!”' the young widower told CBS6. 'I’ll say, ""What happened with the white van?"" And she says, ""It hurt me — it hurt my car!”' Tyler, who is now raising his their children, ages 9, 3 and 1, on his own after his wife's passing, at first did not know what to make of Elisa's night terrors. But then this past weekend he came across several Facebook posts from nearby communities of Foxcroft and Magnolia Green about a series of hit-and-run accidents involving a white box truck. One Facebook user, 17-year-old Caitlyn Thomas, claimed she was side-swiped by a white delivery-style truck on Otterdale Road March 30; the impact of the collision reportedly sent a piece of her side-view mirror crashing through the driver's window. Doubt: Little Elisa, pictured left with her parents and baby brother, and right with her mom, has been having nightmares and daytime visions about a white van, which her father believes may have something to do with the crash . Widower: Craig Tyler says the toddler, pictured above, has told him that the white van in her dreams 'hurt' her and her car . Sightings: A plain white delivery-style box truck, possibly similar to the one pictured above, has been linked to no fewer than three hit-and-run incidents in which two cars and a school bus were side-swiped . According to an eyewitness, the driver of the truck briefly slowed down and turned his head back to look at Thomas' damaged car, but then took off from the scene without waiting for police to arrive. A day earlier, Subastree Thompson said she was also side-swiped by a white box truck on the same road. According to the woman, who was driving with her 3-year-old in the backseat, the white van was carrying two or three men sitting in a single row. The van slowed down for a moment but then sped off before Thompson had a chance to take down its license plate number. Then on April 3, a plain white van matching the same description as in the two earlier incidents allegedly side-swiped a school bus filled with students from Cosby High School. Chesterfield County Police said they were investigating a possible connection between the crashes, but a spokesperson for the department said there was no evidence in Castellano-Tyler's collision to suggest the involvement of another vehicle. Dashing duo: Natali, a native of El Salvador, and Craig met by chance at a restaurant several years ago and married in a courthouse in 2013 . The 30-year-old leaves behind three children, including a 9-year-old boy from a previous relationship in El Salvador and her and Craig's two kids, ages 1 and 3 . Tragic twist: The couple had been planning to have a formal wedding ceremony this coming July and Natali had picked out an ivory lace dress (pictured) for the big day. Instead, she was laid to rest in her dream gown . The woman was just a few miles from her home when at 2pm her 2002 Ford Explorer ran off the road in the 15400 block of Genito Road and careened into a tree, reported the station WRIC. Paramedics arrived on the scene but it was too late for the mother. Her daughter Elisa was taken to a hospital with minor scrapes and bruises. On Monday, nearly two months to the day after the crash, Natali’s husband, Craig, wrote on his Facebook page that he was praying ‘for the truth to be revealed.’ He and Natali, a native of El Salvador, met years earlier at a local restaurant and married with little fanfare in a courthouse on June 21, 2012. The couple had been planning to have a formal wedding ceremony this coming July, followed by a long-awaited honeymoon. Natali had an ivory lace gown picked out for the big day, but instead of wearing it to go down the aisle, she was laid to rest in her dream dress February 27 in the presence of her heartbroken family. A GoFundMe account has been set up to help cover some of the Tyler family's living expenses. So far, more than $15,440 has been raised.","Natali Castellanos-Tyler, 30, married mother of three from Virginia, was killed when she crashed into tree February 21 .

Kalman Kallai enjoyed the spectacular Canadian scenery from the comfort of a green chair while journeying from Borden, Ontario to Comox, British Columbia for work purposes. Calculating that the drive would take him across a colossal 2,796 miles (4500km) of land, Mr Kallai believed that his journey would be more interesting if he used it as an opportunity to see more of his country. The traveller sits before corn, a café, boats and water, before he is featured rocking and making gestures with his hand . Mr Kallai and a friend mimic the planes that fly past at the beginning of the traveller's adventure . After picking up a green rocking chair that he acquired for free from online advertisement site Kijiji, the traveller attached his trailer and set off on the nine-day journey. The video begins with Mr Kallai carrying his chair to a wooded area, before placing it down and taking a seat. He wears a green hoody, blue jacket and hat – clothing items that remain a running theme throughout the course of the video. Mr Kallai travelled from Borden, Ontario to Comox, British Columbia for work purposes . Sat rocking on his chair watching a number of aeroplanes taking off – perhaps at this point wishing he was on one himself – the traveller is joined by a friend. The pair sit and mimic the plane’s wings before shaking hands and waving goodbye to one another, to allow Mr Kallai to continue his adventure on his own.

He momentarily leaves the chair to chase some birds on a beach before making his way through a field and waving at some cows. Later in the video the traveller is met by his dad, who humorously steals the rocking chair before he is swiftly removed. Continuing a good portion of the journey together, the pair dance and jump around in front of rapids and tease a number of large statues. Creature comfort! Mr Kallai makes a number of hand gestures in the video and even waves at cows . Despite hauling the rocking chair around in a trailer, the traveller is also featured carrying it on his head . Mr Kallai said: ‘I brought my dad with me for part of the trek. It was a great bonding experience, as we shared many laughs. ‘I heard some pretty interesting stories about his youth that I hadn't heard before, especially since my mother wasn't on the trip with us.’ The pair reach Manitoba together before they meet with some people and the traveller’s father leaves his son to journey on by himself.

"Wisconsin ended Kentucky's bid to become the first college basketball team to remain undefeated in nearly 40 years, beating the Wildcats 71-64 behind 20 points and 11 rebounds from Frank Kaminsky. Wisconsin will play Duke, an 81-61 winner over Michigan State in the earlier semi-final, at the Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis on Monday night. 'It gives us another 40 minutes, I know that,' said Wisconsin coach Bo Ryan, who leads the Badgers to their first final since 1941.

Wisconsin moved through to the final with a tense victory over Kentucky at the Lucas Oil Stadium . And Kentucky has a long ride home, finishing the season at 38-1 - two wins short of becoming the first undefeated team in college basketball since the 1975-76 Indiana Hoosiers. Instead, these NBA-ready group of Wildcats join the star-studded 1991 UNLV team as the latest to take an undefeated record into the Final Four but lose in the semifinals. Trailing by four and gasping for breath after going 6 minutes without a bucket, the Badgers (36-3) responded with an 8-0 run to take a lead Kentucky couldn't overcome. Kaminsky and Bronson Koenig went 7 for 8 from the line over the last 24 seconds to seal the win. The 70,000-capacity Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, home of the Colts in the NFL, is hosting the Final Four . Wisconsin Badgers fans cheer on their team at the Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis . Kentucky's last, best chance came while trailing by three with 12 seconds left. But Karl-Anthony Towns received the ball in the post and got fouled. He made only one free throw, and from there, Wisconsin clinched it from the foul-line. Earlier Saturday, Justise Winslow scored 19 points and Jahlil Okafor added 18 to lead top-seeded Duke to an 81-61 victory over Michigan State on Saturday and a shot at its fifth national championship. Winslow, who played through some early foul trouble, had nine rebounds and was 5 for 7 from the field, while Okafor grabbed six rebounds and was 7 for 11 from the field.

Senior Quinn Cook had 17 points for the Blue Devils, who dominated the game except for the opening minutes when they trailed 14-6. Defensively, it was a team effort, just the way coach Mike Krzyzewski has stressed for his 35 seasons at Duke. What had been wide open 3-pointers early for Michigan State became contested shots and when the Blue Devils started getting up and on the Spartans, the points were suddenly tough to come by. Denzel Valentine finished with 22 points, which included hitting three quick 3-pointers in the first quarter to give the No.7 seed Michigan State an early lead.

"A young woman has revealed details about her lengthy battle with a rare condition that left her unable to eat anything for a year and a half – despite the fact that she still felt desperately hungry. Kyli Wilfson, a self-confessed ‘food person’, was 26 when she first started experiencing agonizing pain – which made her feel like she had been ‘kicked in the abdomen' – whenever she ate, a symptom which doctors initially brushed off as being due to a mild pancreatic problem which would ‘resolve itself’ in a matter of days. Kyli, now 29, was eventually diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis, and the North Carolina resident found herself looking at a lifetime spent on a feeding tube, as the disease, which effects less than .01 per cent of people, would only get worse. Within months she had dropped to a startling 80lbs, she revealed to Cosmopolitan.com, and  had to postpone her wedding as she spent more and more time in hospitals. Mystery illness: Kyli Wolfson, pictured, had trouble getting a correct diagnosis when she woke up in excruciating pain in October 2012; her illness left her unable to eat for a year and a half . At first, doctors faced difficulties even diagnosing Kyli; though she'd had digestive problems for years, her rare disease wasn't initially considered. Instead, doctors at her local ER insisted that she had acute pancreatitis, a condition that commonly effects heavy drinkers. However, Kyli's pain continued to return every time she tried to eat anything — even soup — leading her to visit two more hospitals in search of a new diagnosis and a cure. 'It never even changed,' she said, explaining that when she tried to eat, it felt like she was burning on the inside. 'It was still ten-out-of-ten pain.' Three months after her first visit to the emergency room, she was finally diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis, a condition she had likely had since birth but was only found after doctors put a camera down her throat to her pancreas — a potentially life-threatening procedure that was only tried after all other options had been exhausted. Literally starving: Still maintaining an appetite but unable to eat without pain, Kyli was constantly hungry — leading her fiancé Dustin Wood to feel bad eating in front of her . Rapid weight loss: Kyli's weight, which is normally at around 110lbs, dropped to 80lbs when she was at her lightest . Sufferers of the illness, which is characterized by an inflammation of the pancreas, have to be fed through a feeding tube because the condition never improves, and eventually leads to permanent damage. Kyli spent a year and half abstaining from eating entirely, which was an incredibly trying ordeal for both her and her fiancé Dustin Wood. 'We're food people,' she said. 'We [love] to bake, order takeout. Now he felt bad eating in front of me.' Luckily, Kyli found a support group for people who have chronic pancreatitis on Facebook, some of whom said they found a way to eat: a risky surgical procedure to remove the pancreas, spleen, gallbladder, appendix, and duodenum, which allows the pancreas' cells to be transplanted into the liver, enabling it to function as a pancreas. So Kyli flew to a hospital in Minnesota that specializes in the 14-hour surgery, and scheduled her procedure for January 2014. Enduring love: Kyli's wedding to fiancé Dustin is back on, now scheduled three years after she first went to the emergency room with stomach pain . After her surgery, Kyli spent another two and a half weeks using a feeding tube before being told to try food again. 'I was excited, but nervous, since it had been so long since I'd eaten,' she said. 'Sure enough, I had chicken broth and juice and it didn't affect anything. It was amazing.' She soon began enjoying ice cream, lobster, and pizza, and was able to return to her normal weight of 110lbs. 'The number one thing that helped was the support group I joined and knowing other people going through it,' she said. 'They saved me and gave me hope.' Now feeling healthy and grateful for the transformative surgery, Kyli was able to reschedule her wedding to Dustin. She will walk down the aisle in October.","Kyli Wolfson, 29, felt severe pain whenever she ate thanks to the disorder, which developed in October 2012, when she was 26 . She dropped to just 80lbs and doctors told her she would likely need a feeding tube for the rest of her life . Diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis, Kyli's only hope was to undergo a 14-hour surgery to remove her pancreas .",580662fa7ac3a8a73698e40b3f9f7dc148256470
"From the lack of sleep to breastfeeding, becoming a mother for the first time is no mean feat. One new mother decided to start a blog called Upfront Mama detailing the trials and tribulations of raising her little girl Poppy, 14 months, who, she says, is the best and most life changing thing that has ever happened to her. Like so many new mothers, Nicola Bonn, 34, from London was learning on the job and found the whole experience 'exciting yet utterly petrifying'. Scroll down for video . Nicola Bonn, 34, from London, started a candid blog called Upfront Mama detailing the trials and tribulations of raising her little girl Poppy, 14 months, and many of her posts have gone viral . She wanted to share all the things that she had learnt so that fellow mothers wouldn’t feel as 'clueless' as she did. One of her blog posts, Why We Need to Stop Justifying Ourselves, went viral - no doubt thanks to her candid account of bringing up a baby for the first time. Here, she shares it with FEMAIL... 'Since becoming a mama I’ve spent way too much time explaining myself and almost apologising for my decisions and I’ve decided that it has to stop. 'The problem is that when you have a baby, everyone has an opinion and they’re often not afraid to air it which can be quite overwhelming for a new mother who is less experienced than the 'advice giver' and is most probably filled with high levels of self doubt. Nicola, 34, wanted to share all the things that she had learnt so that fellow mothers wouldn’t feel as 'clueless' as she did, and admits that since becoming a mother, she's spent way too much time explaining herself and almost apologising for her decisions - and she's decided that it has to stop . She believes one of the main hurdles is that everyone has an opinion and they're often not afraid to air it, which. she says, can be quite overwhelming for a new mother who is less experienced . 'Over the past year, countless people have questioned decisions that I have made. They always do it in this seemingly innocent but quite obviously judgemental way that is hair-pullingly irritating and invariably follow it with a comment about what they might do better. 'Off the top of my head, here are some examples: . 1. You’re still feeding Poppy milk when she wakes up during the night? Oh I wouldn’t do that..she’s far too old. 2. You rock her to sleep? Do you not think she should be self settling at this age? 3. You encourage her to play with her food? Isn’t that encouraging bad manners? 4. You don’t breast feed? You do know that it really is best for bonding? 5. You take her on the underground? It’s full of germs. Why do you do that? 'Instead of doing what I should and saying 'yes I do' in a firm but polite way and ending the conversation there, I always go into great detail about why I do these things. 'No, I don’t breast feed because I find it really tough. I tried but I couldn’t do it and it was actually affecting the bonding process. I do express though…lots and it’s  exhausting but I do it because I’m trying to do my best. Nicola often finds other mothers saying to her: 'You encourage her to play with her food? Isn't that encouraging bad manners?' but says she has to believe in the choices that she makes on a daily basis because if she starts doubting herself then it won't do anyone any good…least of all Poppy . 'Yes, I sometimes rock her to sleep because she loves it and it helps her to settle. I know it’s probably not advisable at her age but it means that she goes to sleep faster and I’m knackered and I need a break and a glass of wine ASAP! 'Yes, I take her on the underground. I can’t drive and that’s how we get around and she loves it. It’s not as if she’s actually licking the floor…well even if she does it can’t be as bad as the toddler who licked the loo brush in Mc Donalds and he didn’t die did he? 'Why do I do this? Why can’t I just believe in my instinct and decisions? None of them have been taken lightly, there is a reason for all of them and as a mother, I have to believe in the choices that I make on a daily basis because if I start doubting myself then it won’t do anyone any good…least of all Poppy. Nicola says that the next time women feel judged for a decision that they have made concerning their child, they shouldn't explain themselves because, after all, they know their child better than anyone else does . 'I’m the first person to ask for advice when I need it and I often do. 'In fact, I think that one of the most beautiful things about motherhood is women passing on wisdom that they have learnt from generation to generation. It creates a magical bond amongst us that makes you proud to be a female and more importantly a mother. But, there is a difference between kindly passing on wisdom and questioning and judging fellow mamas. 'So, next time we feel judged for a decision that we have made concerning our child, let’s not explain ourselves. 'Instead, let’s believe in what we are doing and keep doing it. We know our children better than anyone else does and we are their mothers and that counts for everything!'.","Nicola Bonn, a journalist and broadcaster, shares her candid account .

"When the ultra-rich splash out on a new superyacht, they expect it to come with all the latest accessories. And that's exactly what they get with the 223ft Explorer, which comes with its own helipad, infinity pool and plenty for space for supercar and jetski storage. With space for 12 lucky guests on board, the concept yacht from British yacht designer Tony Castro is the ultimate toy for the extremely wealthy and has been dubbed the 'Range Rover of the seas'. The 223ft Explorer is an exclusive superyacht which comes with its own helipad and car storage as well as space for 12 guests . For those who don't fancy taking a dip in the sea, there is an infinity pool on deck which is two decks deep . For those who would rather board unseen, there is a helipad and helicopter storage as well as space for a submarine . It was designed to withstand any weather conditions and is sturdy enough to circumnavigate the globe - all while looking incredibly stylish, of course. When it comes to transporting all those extras any cruising millionaire needs to hand, there's plenty of space for all of them. The company explains: 'With a large carrying capacity for toys and tenders, she is capable of carrying a helicopter in a climate controlled garage, twin limo tenders, car, submarine, jetskis, paddleboards and a variety of inflatables water toys.' Once the helicopter has landed, it can be store din a climate-controlled garage area . There is storage for jetskis and a submarine on the decks, while leaving plenty of other areas free for passengers . But of course, the life of the ultra-wealthy comes at a cost. According to Tony Castro Design, the superyacht costs approximately 40million euros (around £29million/$43million) to build, which means it is likely to cost even more to purchase. While the yacht has been designed with 'rugged utilitarian-looking aesthetics', it is actually a sumptuous retreat at sea. For the 12 guests, there is space on the yacht for 15 crew, ensuring there is nothing always someone on hand to make sure the journey goes smoohtly. The layout means there are a huge variety of different areas for guests to retreat to, ensuring they don't get fed up with each other while sailing around the world. And for those who can't bear to leave their convertible at home, they can even bring their car on board . Special sundecks open out form the yacht, providing areas for loungers, complete with ladders down into the sea in case guests want to cool off in the water . Unfortunately for most, the superyacht costs 40million euros to build, meaning it will retail for even more . The designers explain: 'Her unique layout holds a full beam enclosed observation deck with opening roof, cinema, beach club, sauna, scuba diving pool, gymnasium, pool, wine cellar and ample space to accommodate a total of 12 guests.' And of course, there are all the other luxurious finishing touches you would expect to find on board. The guests of honour can enjoy accommodation in the Master Cabin or VIP suite, while others can choose between four other double guest cabins. There are also plenty of 'terrace' area, with sunloungers, giving the impression of sitting on the beach as the water laps the sands. In reality, the wooden areas just out into the sea with ladders down so guests can take a dip to cool off whenever they wish. And the entire design is offset with panoramic windows offering views across the ocean. The sleek yacht is a design by Tony Castro, who is base din The Hamble, Hampshire, which is known as a true home of yachting .","The Tony Castro design is estimated to cost 40million euros (£29m/$43m) to build and more to buy .

"For residents of Celoron, N.Y., the statue of hometown icon Lucile Ball is no laughing matter and hasn't been for the past six years.

For residents of Celoron, N.Y., say a statue of hometown icon Lucile Ball is 'monstrous' The statue is based on a famous moment from Ball's show 'I Love Lucy,' in which she pitches an intoxicating health tonic while drunk . Yahoo reports that the anonymous man behind the page says he's a 'big fan of Lucy's.' 'Lucille Ball was not only an amazing comedienne, but she was a stunning beauty. Her sense of humor only made her more beautiful,” he told the site. 'This statue looks nothing like the beautiful Lucy we all know. If for no other reason than that... the statue should go.' He added: 'I don’t think this can be repaired. Take a look at the beautiful statues Nick at Nite created for ‘Bewitched’ and ‘The Honeymooners’ and Bob Newhart… it needs to be something more like those.' Artist Dave Poulin has declined comment. It would cost an estimated $8,000 to $10,000 for Poulin to recast the statue, according to the Celoron Mayor Scott Schrecengost. While the organizer said he is a fan of Poulin's work, this time he failed to do his subject justice. Artist Dave Poulin has declined to comment on the controversy surrounding his work . 'I think it looks like a monster. That is just my opinion,' he told Yahoo. 'When you see it at night, it is frightening.' The statue depicts Ball during one of her most loved moments on the pioneering show 'I Love Lucy,' her intoxicated pitch for the Vitameatavegamin health tonic.

"Dick Advocaat will not make the same mistake he did during his first season at Rangers by playing down the significance of the Old Firm derby. The 67-year-old takes charge of Sunderland for the first time on home soil tomorrow with North-East adversaries Newcastle the visitors. It was back in 1998 that Advocaat said the Old Firm clash was just another game. Celtic won 5-1 and the Dutch boss was criticised by fans and the media for under-estimating the intensity of the rivalry.

Sunderland striker Jermain Defoe (centre) trains with his team-mates ahead of the game with Newcastle . Rangers' Rod Wallace (centre) runs forward with the ball as his side are thrashed 5-1 by Celtic in 1998 . Advocaat had failed to recognise the significance of the Old Firm fixture and this led to a humiliating loss . He recalled: 'To be honest, I did not realise at that moment it was so huge. 'We lost that game and I remember saying in the press conference when they were really upset, 'It is no problem for me because it is just one of 38 games and we will not lose any more'. 'I would not say that anymore! But we became champions that year, six points ahead of Celtic, and won the treble.' Advocaat, though, does admit that his thoughts are trained on three points and not the notion of regional bragging rights. Indeed, the Black Cats are one point above the relegation zone and could be in the bottom three by kick-off. 'Every game is a chance to get a result – and that starts on Sunday,' said Advocaat, who could start Adam Johnson for the first time following his arrest on suspicion of sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl. Sunderland's Adam Johnson was recently arrested on suspicion of sexual activity with an under-age girl . Advocaat is still considering starting the 27-year-old England international in the Wear-Tyne derby . 'If we win the fans might like me, yes, but I would prefer it if they loved me at the end of the season because that would mean we have stayed up.' Sunderland have won just twice at home all season. They have struggled amid an atmosphere of unrest at the Stadium of Light, but that should change tomorrow given the unveiling of Advocaat and the opponents. 'For us, this must be a weapon,' said Advocaat when asked about the home crowd. 'That is the reason I said it is so important to get them behind us, because it is an extra weapon. If the players feel that, they will give even more and I expect that the fans will do that. This is a special game.'

"(CNN)Most companies in South Korea have hoesik at least once a month and sometimes every week. Literally, this means dinner with co-workers. In practice, it means official eating/drinking fests involving multiple rounds of alcohol at multiple venues. For the foreign business traveler, using foreignness as an excuse to bow out of the action only goes so far. The pressure to participate is intense. Drinking etiquette is the first thing you teach foreign guests,"" says Bryan Do, a Korean-American director at the South Korean branch of a U.S. company. ""It was shocking when I first arrived in Korea. ""My boss was a graduate of Korea University [renowned for its hardy drinking culture] and at my first hoesik, we started out with everyone filling a beer glass with soju, and downing it on the spot. That was just the beginning."" For Koreans, drinking is considered a way to get to know what someone is really like. ""I didn't really like it in the beginning,"" says Charles Lee, a Korean-Canadian who came to Seoul to work for a South Korean company. ""I was like, 'Why are you making me drink something when I don't want to?' But once I understood the meaning behind it, I appreciated it more. ""There are just some things you can't say at work or talk about over lunch -- people who talk about work at lunch are losers. But when someone offers you a glass of soju, it's an invitation that means that they want to listen to you. ""I thought Koreans were impersonal before I drank with them, so the whole context is important."" Drinking is such a big part of Korean life that Seoul traffic is said to correspond with the city's drinking culture. Mondays are a big night for hoesik, so there are fewer cars during evening rush hour, as most office workers leave them at work so they can go drinking. Tuesdays are a rest day, while Wednesday and Thursday nights are also big nights for company drinking. Fridays have the worst evening traffic, as everyone is taking their cars home to use with their families over the weekend. So how do you avoid offending someone (worst of all, a superior or client) at a Korean drinking extravaganza? Follow these seven handy rules. Koreans always identify the ""higher"" person in the relationship, and defer to them accordingly. One of the first things Koreans often ask when meeting someone new is their age. Even someone just a year older is afforded a language of respect, though age is always superseded by a higher position. It's considered rude for anyone to have an empty glass. If a senior person is pouring -- this usually pertains to hard liquor only -- others shouldn't drink until someone has poured the senior a shot. After all glasses are full, everyone says ""Gunbae!"" and chugs -- usually ""one-shotting"" the entire glass in one go. While downing alcohol, you should turn your body away from senior figures so that your body visually blocks your drinking action from your senior. Always hold bottles or shot glasses with both hands. By raising your glass or pouring alcohol with one hand, you are establishing yourself as a senior person. If you're not, well, you've just breached protocol. It's always a good idea to find out people's drinking habits beforehand. It shouldn't be difficult to find out what people like to drink or how they behave when intoxicated. Hoesik usually involves changing venues for a different type of alcohol -- i.e., round one is dinner, accompanied by beer, round two is soju, round three is for whiskey, and so on. Be ready for each. Unless you have an airtight reason, refusing alcohol is considered a mood killer and deemed rude. Sorry, but ""I don't like soju"" doesn't qualify as a good reason not to punish your liver. Neither would ""I've been on the wagon for three years."" In fact, unless you're pregnant or already puking, what might be a ""good reason"" not to imbibe elsewhere often won't fly here. It's generally best to accept and discreetly get rid of unwanted alcohol (under the table, into your water cup, out the window) than to refuse it. One of the most popular venues in Korea for business drinking is the karaoke bar. Koreans love singing, as evidenced by the country's staggering number of karaoke bars, as well as the rush of audition programs on Korean television. Your companions won't rest until you sing. They'll coax, threaten, push and cajole until you finally take that mic. Be prepared to crack under the immense peer pressure. If you simply cannot take any more, you can call a black knight (male) or a black rose (female) to your rescue. This entails a person of your choosing drinking your glass for you, but it also means they get a wish. As in, you might soon wish you'd just taken that last shot as you're spelling your name out with your butt in front of your client. Bottoms up. Christopher Cha is a Korean-American writer based in Seoul.","Hoesik is the Korean tradition of eating and drinking together .

"Older people are more susceptible to emotions when making decisions over their retirement, scientists have warned (file picture) Older people are more susceptible to emotions when making decisions over their retirement, scientists have warned. Experts in America found that more than 50 per cent of pensioners with investments during the 2007 and 2008 global financial crisis panicked and sold them after the stock market fell by 30 per cent. Research carried out by scientists at Texas Tech University showed how those who did follow that path and sold at the lowest point eight years ago with a pension of £100,000 would only have £63,000 today. If they had resisted the temptation to sell, the same pot would be worth £141,000 today provided they had not spent any of the cash. It comes just days before retirees in Britain are given the power to decide how to spend their life savings for the first time ever in the biggest shake-up of pensions for almost a century. The Daily Telegraph quotes the authors of the study, Michael Finke and Chris Browning as saying: ‘Avoiding mistakes requires the ability to regulate emotions through our more rational cognitive process. ‘Consumers are increasingly responsible for managing their retirement savings... (but) we also find that cognitive scores decline with advance age.’ The newspaper says 1,204 retired people with investments between 2006 and 2008 were analysed as part of the study, which has been published in the Journal of Consumer Affairs.

"The Football Association will be contacting QPR and Chelsea after an incident which saw Branislav Ivanovic struck on the head by a cigarette lighter thrown from a section of home supporters at Loftus Road.

"Game of Thrones fans who did not want to wait and legally watch HBO's hit series premiere its fifth season tonight have leaked the first four episodes online. Online pirates have unveiled nearly  half of the show's next season, which is scheduled to debut its first episode tonight. The episodes began appearing on torrent download sites on Saturday night, and are thought to have leaked from review copies given to the press. Fans of the show, which follows the ambitions and betrayals of competing noble factions and families in the fantasy world of Westeros, now face the daunting task of avoiding spoilers online as the first four episodes are released over the course of the month. Scroll down for video . Game of Thrones, which includes characters such as Emilia Clarke's Khaleesi (left) and Nathalie Emmanuel's Missandei (right), was pirated before its season five debut tonight . Episodes beginning this year's season are titled The Wars to Come, The House of Black and White, High Sparrow and The Sons of the Harpy. They had been downloaded more than 550,000 times as of early Sunday morning, Variety reported, citing the piracy-tracking company Excipio. 'Sadly, it seems the leaked four episodes of the upcoming season of Game of Thrones originated from within a group approved by HBO to receive them. We're actively assessing how this breach occurred,' HBO said in a statement to Daily Mail Online. The series is the most illegally downloaded program in the world. Anti-piracy company Irdeto said that episodes from Game of Thrones's first four seasons were illegally downloaded more than seven million times between February and April 2015.

"The artist behind a statue of Lucille Ball so terrifying it has been nicknamed 'Scary Lucy' has admitted to being 'disappointed' in his work, offering to fix the sculpture for free. Residents of Celoron, New York, hometown of the famous comedienne, reacted with shock and horror when the 'I Love Lucy' statue was unveiled in 2009. Following a recent social media campaign to have the bronze statue removed, sculptor Dave Poulin  called it 'by far my most unsettling sculpture', and pledged to make a new one. Following a campaign to have the statue of Lucille Ball sculptor Dave Poulin has pledged to make a new one . The depiction is so unflattering a Facebook page called 'We Love Lucy! Get Rid of this Statue' has attracted more than 600 likes. Yahoo reports that the anonymous man behind the page says he's a 'big fan of Lucy's.' 'Lucille Ball was not only an amazing comedienne, but she was a stunning beauty. Her sense of humor only made her more beautiful,” he told the site. 'This statue looks nothing like the beautiful Lucy we all know. If for no other reason than that... the statue should go.' However, in a letter to the Hollywood Reporter, Poulin admits: From the day of its installation, I have shared my disappointment in the final outcome and have always believed it to be by far my most unsettling sculpture, not befitting of Lucy’s beauty or my ability as a sculptor. 'In retrospect, it should have never been cast in bronze and made public, and I take complete ownership of that poor decision.' For residents of Celoron, N.Y., say a statue of hometown icon Lucile Ball is 'monstrous' The statue is based on a famous moment from Ball's show 'I Love Lucy,' in which she pitches an intoxicating health tonic while drunk . He adds that he offers to return to Celoron and 'remove the current statue with the promise of creating a new beautiful and charming ""Lucy"" in its place.' It would cost an estimated $8,000 to $10,000 for Poulin to recast the statue, according to the Celoron Mayor Scott Schrecengost. While the organizer said he is a fan of Poulin's work, this time he failed to do his subject justice. 'I think it looks like a monster. That is just my opinion,' he told Yahoo. 'When you see it at night, it is frightening.' The statue depicts Ball during one of her most loved moments on the pioneering show 'I Love Lucy,' her intoxicated pitch for the Vitameatavegamin health tonic. The statue was the latest way the town has tried to honor its most famous resident, with the Jameston area already home to a Lucille Ball Desi Arnaz Museum & Center for Comedy.","The depiction is so unflattering a Facebook page called 'We Love Lucy!

"A Mayfair mansion that was once the site of a milking parlour has gone on the market for £25million. The four-bedroom property in central London's Farm Street has all the trappings of modern luxury with an indoor swimming pool, gym, lift, cinema room and roof terrace. One hundred and fifty years ago however it was used to house cows for milking on one of London's busiest trading streets. Originally used as a milking parlour, it  became a depot before being knocked down in the 19th Century. In 2011 developers took over the site and demolished the house to make way for the plush mansion which now sits in its place. At 8,139 square ft, it is on the market for £25million. A newly-built mansion that was constructed on the site of a former milking parlour in Mayfair has gone on the market for £25million . The house is decorated throughout with modern furnishings and plush carpets. Among its features is a private lift and guest cloakroom . A grand piano sits in the marbled hall on one of the floor's houses. A 14-piece dining table is also featured in the luxury dining room .

London's milking parlours date back to Tudor times, with Farm Street serving as hub of agricultural trade for years. Cows were brought there from the grazing areas of Peckham, Holland Park and Hampstead heath and sold to local butchers. Alongside the parlours was an abattoir and pub, the Punch Bowl, which remains. Guy Ritchie and Madonna bought the pub while they were married and it quickly became a celebrity favourite. Mr Ritchie sold it in 2013 to the Alexander Langlands Pearse. Inside the modern mansion are four bedrooms including a master suite which occupies the entire second floor. The lower ground floors feature a swimming pool complex with mosaic-lined pool, steam room, gym, shower and changing facilities, kitchenette, guest cloakroom and media room. It also has a private lift, marble flooring, a sweeping spiral staircase and a dining room which can seat 14. Speaking of the property, Peter Wetherell, chief executive of Wetherell, said: 'This recently built house is an outstanding example of contemporary living in historic Mayfair at its very best.

"The National Trust has replaced antique furniture with beanbags at one of its historic homes in an ‘experiment’ which has enraged heritage experts. Furniture dating back to 1820 was moved from the library at Ickworth House in Suffolk earlier this year and replaced with four brown leatherette bean bags. The move was designed to encourage visitors to ‘dwell and take in the atmosphere’ in the room but it provoked fury from heritage expects who branded the move ‘misguided’. The National Trust has replaced antique furniture with beanbags in the library of Ickworth House, Suffolk . Now it has emerged that similar experiments will take place at nine other of its venues around the country. Art historian Bendor Grosvenor, whose blog post on his Art History News site about Ickworth sparked the controversy, told The Independent: ‘I suspect the hoo-ha about the beanbags may at least cause them rethink what they were going to do. The National Trust said the beanbag experiment was 'short-term' Pictured: Ickworth House, Suffolk . ‘I don’t think you’ll ever bring in a new audience by talking down to it. Experimentation and bringing in new audiences are marvellous but there are better ways of doing it by taking away things people might want to see. It’s patronising nonsense.’ The National Trust’s director of strategy, curatorship and external affairs Simon Murray told The Art Newspaper that the Trust ‘presents each house in context’ and that each is different and treated appropriately. He said: ‘We are not a museum that takes objects, shows them in a display case, shines a light on them and labels them’. But he said this meant that ‘many visitors find a vast array of objects in front of them, cast a cursory eye over them and don’t get a great deal from the experience.’ He said the beanbag experiment was a short-term arrangement which would not necessarily continue for the whole year. But he added: ‘Some of our staff think we should have used a rather different sort of seating and others think it is good as an experiment.’",Four brown leatherette bean bags placed in library at Ickworth House .

"Three people have been taken to hospital following a head-on collision between a vintage sports car and a 4WD. The crash happened on Easter Sunday night on Warringah Road in Frenchs Forest, northern Sydney at a traffic light intersection.

A 1973 E-Type Jaguar has been involved in a crash with a Toyota Kluger . Nobody was hurt in the collision, however all three adults were taken to hospital as a precaution. NSW police told Daily Mail Australia that they are still investigating the circumstances surrounding the devastating collision. The photos of the crash were posted to the NSW Traffic and Highway Patrol Command's Facebook page, where car enthusiasts were quick to sympathise with the owner of the classic Jaguar. The crash occurred on Warringah Road in Frenchs Forest . 'That is a really, really rare car. They go for over $120,000. I feel sorry for the owner,' one Facebook user said.

"Geoff Barrow has accused streaming services of giving music away, saying his band Portishead were paid just £1,700 despite getting 34million plays . The founder of rock band Portishead has waded into the debate over music streaming, saying that he received just £1,700 in royalties despite his songs being played 34million times. In a series of tweets Geoff Barrow, Portishead's founder and instrumentalist, attacked Spotify, YouTube, Apple and 'especially' Universal Music for selling his music cheaply. He added that he has nothing against streaming, but wants musicians to be paid more, and says it is hurting young talent, stopping people from establishing themselves on the scene. Barrow, who also runs the Invada record label, told The Times: 'You used to write a piece of music and people paid you to listen to it. 'Yet for younger artists who just want to play rock and roll, by the time they get to a major label, all their rights will have been sold away. 'There will be not much meat left on the bone. You see these huge deals but will smaller bands be able to buy a Ford Galaxy to go on tour in if this isn't sorted out?' Artists have long railed against the low royalties paid from streaming companies, leading to Jay-Z launching his own Tidal service this month, promising bigger returns for musicians. Pop megastar Taylor Swift and Thom York, frontman of indie rockers Radiohead, have also pulled their music from services such as Spotify in protest. However, record companies have been quick to upload their music on to these platforms to prop up the collapse in CD sales after music moved online. Barrow, who heads up record label Invada as well as playing in Portishead (pictured), said he was not opposed to streaming technology, but was concerned young artists were getting a poor deal . Streaming companies have also defended their practices, saying they offer artists a fair price in an age where music can be easily accessed for nothing. Rihanna, Madonna, Beyonce, Usher, Daft Punk, Arcade Fire, Jack White and Kanye West banded together to help launch Jay Z's $20-a-month Tidal streaming service last month, which aims to offer artists a better deal. The membership-based service  will operate in a similar format to Spotify, providing music and exclusive videos that users can stream on computers, tablets and smartphones or listen to offline. The ongoing row between artists, music labels and streaming companies lead to Jay Z launching his own service, Tidal, which aims to give musicians a better deal . Backed by a host of musicians such as Arcade Fire, Daft Punk, Madonna, and Alicia Keys, Jay Z plans to charge £20-per-month for the service, and will give the artists a bigger share . Unlike Spotify there isn't a free service and users will have to pay $9.95 for standard sound quality or $19.99 for 'lossless high fidelity sound quality.' Tidal streams at 1,411 kilobytes per second - well above the 320 for premium subscribers of Spotify, which offers lower levels for free users. Speaking at the launch event, Alicia Keys said: 'Our mission goes beyond commerce, it goes beyond technology. Our intent is to preserve music's importance in our lives.'",Geoff Barrow said streaming services and record labels give music away .

"Three hours after giving birth to her longed-for baby girl, Lianne Hindle lay dead in the same hospital bed. The mother-of-four suffered a cardiac arrest at the scandal-hit North Manchester General Hospital in December. The 37-year-old's death came just months after three babies and one mother died at the maternity unit. The deaths, along with those of four babies and two mothers at the Royal Oldham Hospital prompted an investigation. Today Ms Hindle's partner Chris Barnes and his sister Karen have called for action to prevent further tragedies. Chris Barnes, whose partner Lianne Hindle died three hours after giving birth to their daughter Poppy (pictured with brothers Zac and Louie), is calling for action to prevent further tragedies at North Manchester General Hospital . The 40-year-old father-of-four said: 'Something has to be done. It isn't right. 'This is still happening. Maternity units are supposed to be the safest places to have babies.' Mr Barnes, who suffers with cerebral palsy, has been left to care for the couple's three-month-old daughter Poppy, and her three brothers, Morgan, 15, Zac, nine, and Louie, seven. North Manchester General and the Royal Oldham Hospital called in independent experts to review its maternity units after the spate of 10 deaths in the eight-month period from December 2013 to July last year. Ms Hindle, from Bury, died in December - her death falling outside the scope of the investigation. She went into labour at almost 35 weeks pregnant, in the early hours of December 15. The expectant mother was scheduled to give birth at St Mary's Hospital, which has a specialist intensive care baby unit, after suffering two previous stillbirths, and three premature pregnancies. But she was taken to North Manchester General by ambulance instead, after it became clear she was going to give birth before she could get to St Mary's. This is the only picture Ms Hindle's family have of her holding daughter Poppy . Immediately after welcoming baby Poppy shortly after 2am, Mr Barnes said his partner appeared 'fine', holding the newborn and naming her. But just an hour later,  she started to feel unwell  - complaining that she was 'red hot'. Ms Barnes described how Ms Hindle started to look 'deathly white', and felt cold and clammy to touch, before her eyes began rolling back in her head. Her blood pressure and heart rate plummeted as her condition deteriorated and she died at around 6am after suffering a cardiac arrest. Ms Barnes said the family has concerns about the care Ms Hindle received, claiming she was left alone with a student midwife following the birth, once the placenta had been delivered. 'Lianne was repeatedly talking of how red hot she was, asking for a fan and the windows to be opened,' Ms Barnes said. 'The student midwife said that was normal after having a baby and wafted her with a sick bowl. 'I didn't see Lianne's temperature taken once.' Ms Barnes claimed at one point, a member of staff came into the room and asked the student midwife: 'Who are you supposed to be with?' To which the student replied, ""exactly"", Ms Barnes said. Ms Hindle's family said no one from the hospital had contacted them since her death. Ms Barnes added: 'That makes us feel that she just wasn't important to them.' Mr Barnes, who suffers cerebral palsy, has been left to care for the couple's four children, Zac, nine, Morgan, 15, three-month-old Poppy, and Louie, seven . A spokesman for The Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust said: 'Our condolences go out to the family in this tragic case. 'Lianne was diverted to us as an emergency on the way to another hospital. 'She was not previously known to our maternity service and while her baby was delivered safely, tragically Lianne subsequently died. 'We are unable to comment further as this case has been referred to the coroner and has not yet been heard. 'We deliver 10,000 babies each year and would like to reassure families about the safety of maternity services at our hospitals, but if any expectant mother has a concern they can contact their designated midwife to discuss this.' Mr Barnes said: 'Lianne had always dreamed of a little girl. She was a strong character and loved her family. Her death has shocked and devastated us. It doesn't seem real. 'The boys have been pretty resilient but Louie is a mummy's boy and recently has been waking up in the night and crying out for her. That has been hard to take.' A date for her inquest has not yet been set. An investigation was launched at the North Manchester General Hospital after the deaths of three babies and a mother at the hospital between December 2013 and July last year. The probe also looked at the deaths of four babies and two mothers at the Royal Oldham Hospital over the same time period . A catalogue of failings have been uncovered at two NHS hospitals after seven babies and three mothers died there in the space of just eight months. Independent investigators were called into Royal Oldham after the deaths of four babies and two mothers, and North Manchester General after the deaths of another three babies and one mother. Lisa Parkisson, 35, died at Oldham Royal 48 hours after giving birth in April this year, while newborn Thomas Beaty died at the same hospital in June after doctors pushed him back into the womb during birth. A summary of the investigation, which was kept secret from the families of the dead until now, has been seen by MailOnline and found 'notable absence of clinical leadership' in the maternity wards, and a 'failure to adequately plan care' in a number of cases. Lisa Parkisson, 35, (left with son Zac) died 48 hours after giving birth at Oldham Royal in June last year. Thomas Beaty (right) died from  at the same hospital after doctors forced him back into the womb . A team of independent investigators also found risk management was 'below standard' in some cases - though there were no apparent 'deficiencies in care' in the deaths of the three mothers. The report noted that several of the mothers were obese or morbidly obese, which can lead to complications, but that national guidelines for treating overweight people were not followed. Officials also criticised the hospital's own investigations, saying the root cause of the deaths was not always identified, opportunities to learn lessons were not always picked up, and that some recommendations were too general and difficult to measure. All of the deaths are believed to have occurred between December 2013, and July last year. Pennine Acute is in the process of producing an action plan based on the recommendations from the findings. They include strengthening clinical leadership and risk management, making sure enough staff are on duty to ensure safety and reviewing the process for employing temporary locum doctors. Gill Harris, chief nurse at Pennine Acute, said last week: 'The Trust is always keen to learn and to improve care. We commissioned a review by experts from outside the Trust to look at the details of a small number of maternity cases at our hospitals. Independent investigators found failings in care and hospital leadership at Oldham Royal following the deaths of four babies and two mothers there in eight months . 'We are now considering that report and are developing a number of actions as a result to make some improvements to ensure we continue to provide the best quality of care for our patients. 'We deliver 10,000 babies each year and would like to reassure families about the safety of maternity services at our hospitals, but if any expectant mother has a concern they can contact their designated midwife to discuss this.' A spokeswoman for the Care Quality Commission, the health regulator, said: 'CQC is aware that Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust has recently initiated an external review into its maternity services and we are in close liaison with the trust, NHS England and local CCG regarding the review findings.'",Lianne Hindle suffered a cardiac arrest at North Manchester General . 37-year-old died three hours after giving birth to baby Poppy .

City have won on their last three visits to Old Trafford - the famous 6-1 in 2011/12, 2-1 in 2012/13 and 3-0 last season - which is a run Rooney and Co will be desperately hoping to bring to an end.

'We want to keep the momentum going and the positive play. It would be nice (to finish above City) but we are just taking each game as it comes.

"CCTV footage of the devastating moment a man put his brother in a coma with a single punch has been released for the first time, with the brother responsible soon to learn if he will serve prison time. Downing Centre Local Court showed the security footage of the violent altercation between Irishman Barry Lyttle and his younger brother, Patrick, during a sentence hearing on Wednesday. Prosecutor Alex Poulos called for Barry, from Belfast in Ireland's north, to face a full-time jail term as it was the 'only appropriate sentence' after the violent incident in Sydney in January. Scroll down for video . After being pushed by Patrick Lyttle, his brother retaliates with a single punch (left) which causes his brother to fall to the ground, his head snapping back and body crumpling (right) Barry Lyttle has been charged with grievous bodily harm and has pleaded guilty to the charge . Magistrate Graeme Curran said a jail sentence was likely, explaining 'the issue is whether or not I suspend a prison term'. Barry could spend up to two years in a Sydney jail, despite his brother's calls for the charges to be dropped. On Thursday, security footage was shown for the first time, revealing the details of the distressing altercation outside Hugo's Lounge in Sydney's Potts Point when Patrick received a single blow to the head during an argument with his brother Barry. In court on Thursday, Patrick comforted his inconsolable brother as they watched the footage. Before the fight the brothers, who had only been reunited for a holiday in Australia for a matter of days, are seen chatting jovially and patting each other on the back affectionately. But after leaving the bar a fight escalated quickly. The court saw footage of the brothers standing nose-to-nose, exchanging some tense words. As Barry starts to walk away from the argument, Patrick pushes his big brother roughly. Patrick was treated by paramedics at the scene where he was found in a pool of blood and vomit on January 3 . Patrick Lyttle (middle) has called on charges against his brother Barry (left) to be dropped . The brothers from Belfast in Ireland (pictured here as children) went on a night out on January 3 in Kings Cross . Mr Lyttle pleaded guilty after the crown declined to downgrade the charge against him . The Irishman could learn his fate as soon as Thursday afternoon when the matter returns to court for a possible sentencing hearing . A split second later, Barry retaliates with a brutal punch to Patrick's head. It is a distressing scene as Patrick's head snaps back from the force of Barry's blow. His body buckles beneath him and he crumples to the ground, his head slamming against the pavement. As Patrick lies unresponsive on the ground, a clearly-distressed Barry immediately rushes to his brother's side, frantically trying to revive him. Patrick nearly lost his life after suffering traumatic head injuries. He was found by emergency services in a pool of blood and vomit, and remained in a coma at Sydney's St Vincent's Hospital for six days after the January 3 altercation. Patrick says he has since made a 'fantastic recovery.' Barry pleaded guilty to recklessly causing grievous bodily harm, whilst his brother called for the charges to be dismissed. Barry Lyttle (pictured left) has pleaded guilty to causing his brother Patrick (right) grievous bodily harm . The Lyttle family has previously said they believe the charge against Barry (centre) should be dropped . Patrick Lyttle (right) said he had made a 'fantastic recovery' On Thursday, Patrick delivered an impassioned victim's statement, pleading for Barry to be spared a prison sentence and for the family to be allowed to return to Ireland together to 'heal'. 'When my family is healed I will be healed,' Patrick Lyttle told the court. 'It has been an awful ordeal for me but everyone can see it has been for Barry too. 'Victims often want to see deterrence. But everyone can see how much my brother has suffered.' Patrick also pointed out their father Oliver's health has greatly suffered as a result of the trauma. Their father was in Australia with the two men on what had intended as a trip of a lifetime, but has become a nightmare. Barry Lyttle is pictured arriving at court with his brother, Patrick, and his girlfriend, Patricia last week . 'He doesn't want to go home without his two sons,' Patrick said. Patrick asked the court to consider allowing Barry to return to Ireland so the brothers can embark on a career in youth work, telling young people their story to warn of the dangers of violence. Barry's lawyer Chris Watson said his client was remorseful, unlikely to re-offend and of good character. The 33-year-old will be sentenced in Sydney's local court, where the maximum jail term is two years, rather than the district court, where people could face up to 10 years for that offence. Barry Lyttle's barrister Chris Watson said the punch was a 'very emotional, spur of the moment act' that immediately followed being aggressively attacked by his brother, and that Barry Lyttle had immediately shown 'an extreme level of contrition and remorse', according to the Sydney Morning Herald. Any animosity between the two has since gone and they walked from court together on Thursday, as they have done at earlier appearances. Barry will return to court for sentencing on April 24.

"Brendan Rodgers has criticised Raheem Sterling’s advisor, suggesting that the player is being manipulated by outside forces and that he would be inclined to stay at Liverpool if left to make a decision alone. With Liverpool losing 4-1 at Arsenal on Saturday and seeing their hopes of qualifying for the Champions League next season effectively ending, Rodgers made veiled criticisms of the player’s agent, Aidy Ward, after the televised interview Sterling gave last week, in which he admitted he was flattered by Arsenal’s interest in him. Rodgers also revealed that he has sat down with Sterling since that TV interview and to tell him that his best interest would be served by staying at the club for now, even though there may come a time when he does leave. Raheem Sterling  goes past Mathieu Flamini during the Barclays Premier League match at the Emirates . Sterling has reject a contract extension worth £100,000 a week and has just two years left on his deal at the end of this season, but Rodgers said: ‘I’ve had a good chat with him. I have given him my opinion on it. This is a young kid who has been advised to do something else. A 20-year-old boy does not pick up the phone to ask to speak to the BBC. ‘You don’t do that; him in particular. He just wants to play his football. But of course if he’s asked to do that by other parties then that’s what he’ll do. ‘In the modern game it is obviously something that frustrates us all but it is the market and where football is at. In fairness to Raheem, I brought him in from the youth team and the reserves and I know that a big part of this is actually nothing to do with him.’ Sterling has rejected a contract extension worth £100,000 a week and has just two years left on his deal . ‘In my time in coaching there are a lot of very, very good agents. The only thing I would say on Raheem’s situation is that anyone can see that for his football development and financially, Liverpool Football Club is the best place for him. There is absolutely no question of that. ‘I think he enjoys being at Liverpool and loves playing for Liverpool and knows he is privileged to play in front of Liverpool supporters. As a kid he knows the opportunity is there for him to improve as a footballer. What that will be in five, six, seven years time is different. But for this moment of his career and life, he really enjoys it. He has said that himself. He has talked very openly about loving his football and playing for a great club like Liverpool.’ Sterling said he was flattered by Arsenal's interest in signing him should he leave Liverpool this summer . Sterling grapples with Arsenal defender Hector Bellerin during Liverpool's defeat to the Gunners . Rodgers admits that the task may have become more difficult now that Liverpool’s hunt for a top four spot seems to have come to an end but remains confident that he can persuade the player to extend his deal . ‘As long as the player can see the ambition of the club. We all know the reality of where the game is at in this country. There are bigger spenders than ourselves and more experienced squads – the model at Liverpool is different. ‘Of course players will want to look at possibilities when that time comes. But when you talk specifically about Raheem – because he’s got huge potential but there’s still a bit to go - then I think Liverpool is the best place for him. Sterling competes with Laurent Koscielny during a defeat which all-but ends Liverpool's top four chances . ‘He has had the opportunity to play, which is key for a young player. It is the model of Liverpool, which the owners have put in, where they want to create the world class talent. He has just turned 20. There is still a long way for him to go and he has a lot of potential. I believe that will be developed over the next coming years at Liverpool. ‘It is the job of his advisors to look at the possibilities might be beyond that. But he has two and a half years left and won’t be going anywhere in the summer – that’s for sure. And we’ll sit down again with the club and his representatives to hopefully find the solution in the summer.’ Sterling is taken to ground by Arsenal's German defender Per Mertesacker during the game in north London . Rodgers went out of his way to play the player, who missed an easy first half opportunity to put Liverpool ahead but who was their most consistent threat and won them the penalty they scored. Rodgers said: ‘There was no change in him. I thought he was excellent today, our best player. He was aggressive in his running, pressed the ball well, he won the penalty. He was very direct and strong. ‘This is a kid that is really focused on his football. There’s no change and he works hard every single day. And you see from today, he just wants to play his football. The kid for me gives me everything the way he trains and plays.’",Brendan Rodgers has hit out at those advising Raheem Sterling .

"A freezer trawler has sunk in a peninsula off the coast of Russia, killing at least 56 crew members. A massive rescue operation involving more than 1,300 people is now underway after the ship, carrying an international crew of 132, sank in the Sea of Okhotsk in just 15 minutes. Rescued crew members reported that the ship, called the Dalny Vostock, was unstable because of empty fuel tanks and a lack of ballast as it sailed through the Kamchatka Peninsula. The Russian freezer trawler, called the Dalny Vostok, that sank while carrying 132 crew members at 4am on Thursday morning local time. At least 54 bodies have been recovered in the huge rescue operation . Map showing the location of the disaster. There are 13 members of the crew are still missing after the trawler tipped over when a fishing net was pulled in, a regional governor told Russian television on Thursday . It tipped over when a fishing net weighing 80 tons was pulled in, said Oleg Kozhemyako, acting governor of the nearby Sakhalin region. Kozhemyako's comments on Russian television came after the federal Investigative Committee said it was considering all possible causes for the sinking, but it was likely that the trawler hit 'an object' floating in the sea, perhaps drifting ice. More than 26 fishing boats in the area have helped to rescue members of the crew, but have also recovered 56 bodies. The disaster happened at around 4am local time, and the trawler did not send any distress signals before it sank, the Interfax News Agency said. Early reports added that the Dalny Vostok sank in just 15 minutes after its engine compartment had been flooded. So far 63 people have been rescued, with survivors suffering from hypothermia and other injuries being airlifted to hospital. At the latest count there are 13 people still missing. An emergency services representative told local media that two of the bodies were found on Thursday evening - one in a lifeboat 105 kilometres (65 miles) away, and the other in the water nearby. Those saved had managed to get into lifeboats and some had put on wet suits. The Russian Emergencies Ministry sent an Mi-8 helicopter with rescuers and doctors aboard to treat and transport rescued crew members to hospitals in the city of Magadan, it said on its website. A rescuer uses a satellite phone while onboard a helicopter as they fly over the Sea of Okhotsk scouring the waters for survivors. Around 1,300 fishermen and emergency staff are involved in the rescue operation . A Russian Emergencies Ministry ship looks for survivors after the Dalny Vostock sank. Temperatures in the water can dip to as low as -2 degrees celsius, and so far it is confirmed that 56 crew members have drowned . A telephone hotline for families of the crew has also been set up. Among the 132 crew members, 78 are from Russia, 42 from Myanmar and the rest from Latvia, Ukraine and Vanuatu. Pyotr Osichansky, president of the Far Eastern Association of Sea Captains, told Russian television that when the trawler last docked in Russia, in January, it had fewer than 70 crew members. The additional crew members were most likely picked up in Pusan, South Korea, and were working illegally, he said. The Sea of Okhotsk is the coldest sea in East Asia with the air temperature plummeting to -20 degrees Celsius in the winter months. Following the tragedy 63 people have been rescued, but the bodies of 56 sailors have been pulled from the freezing sea. Early reports say the trawler sank in 15 minutes when its engine room was flooded . Between October and April the area the area is 'constantly' covered with ice and there is very little rain, according to Encyclopedia Britannica. Survivors of the incident are reportedly being interviewed as well as the owners of the trawler, as the police start investigating the disaster. It is understood they are questioning whether there was a violation of safety procedures that led to more deaths, a report in Russia Today said.

"Frightened: Diana Doyle was plagued with cold calls . A firm linked to the sale of NHS patient data is offering details of eating disorder sufferers for just 12p a head, the Mail can reveal today. It has also offered to supply names of those suffering from stress, hair loss, dandruff, impotence and snoring. Even details of dieters and those who have had plastic surgery appear on the list of data for sale. The Mail has this week exposed companies that have secretly sold private financial and medical information without proper checks. Our investigation has revealed that: . The revelations have prompted probes by the Information Commissioner’s Office and the Direct Marketing Commission. A third investigation has been launched by the General Pharmaceutical council into Pharmacy2U, the UK’s biggest online pharmacy. The Mail revealed that Pharmacy2U had passed information on NHS patients to Alchemy Direct Media. The eating disorder data – passed to the Mail by a whistleblower – is being touted by a firm called Sequester, which is a business partner of Alchemy. Sequester is offering to sell information on people suffering from 43 different health conditions – from skin problems to insomnia and migraines. It claims to be able to identify those who have had plastic surgery, who smoke, wear glasses or contact lenses or have sensitive teeth. It also appears to offer details of which credit cards people have and which banks they use, as well as whether they have wills or health insurance. Such data is a goldmine for unscrupulous firms and criminals – who can use it to target vulnerable individuals and scam them over the phone. The whistleblower, who works in the data industry, said it was ‘madness’ that so much personal information was available to him and he had passed it to the Mail because he was worried about who else might have access to it. He said: ‘I am not registered with the regulators, I’m just a man who has worked in the industry at some point – and all this information is available to me. It’s absolute madness.’ The list of categories of data was contained in an email – seen by the Mail – from Sequester’s CEO Matthew Foy in which he described the information his firm was able to supply on its new database. At the top of the email, he writes: ‘Please do not distribute this list.’ The whistleblower said: ‘Imagine who else could get their hands on this. When I realised the level of information companies like Sequester have, that is when I knew how serious a problem this is. ‘We give our private health and financial details to people we trust, it is not fair they end up in the hands of people we don’t.’ He said he had been sent databases containing records of thousands of people’s pensions, investments and intimate health details. Dr Sarah Wollaston, who was the Tory chairman of the Commons health committee, said 'it's appalling' One of those on Sequester’s arthritis database is Diana Doyle from Wandsworth in London, who says she is ‘frightened’ her health details are being sold on. The grandmother, whose husband suffers from vascular dementia and is in a home, added: ‘I’m a very private person, I always say, “No thank you” when asked for my details. ‘I’m on my own at home now, so this is very frightening.’ She suspects her medical details were obtained from a survey she filled out in a catalogue. The 74-year-old has had to change her home phone number because she was getting so many nuisance calls. Dr Sarah Wollaston, who was the Tory chairman of the Commons health committee, last night said: ‘It is appalling that this kind of deeply personal and sensitive information is being traded. It is deeply worrying.’ When approached by the Mail, bosses at Sequester, which describes itself as a data controller, claimed they had never actually distributed any information on eating disorders or any of the other sensitive health information advertised in the email. Chief executive Mr Foy said the company did not hold such information and that his email had simply been saying that ‘this list is available on the market, that we could find it for a client’. ‘That does not necessarily mean it is available for release,’ he said. Watchdog will probe 'rogue' data firms who sold Mail's undercover reporters the financial data of 15,000 people . By Lucy Osborne . Two firms exposed by the Daily Mail as selling private information are to be probed by the industry watchdog. B2C Data sold our undercover reporters the financial data of 15,000 people – including details about their pension pots, incomes and investments. The second firm – Data Bubble – supplied our team with health details on 3,000 patients – such as whether they suffered from high blood pressure, arthritis or even bladder problems. The Direct Marketing Commission said it would probe both companies over claims that they had breached the rules on the sale of private data. It confirmed it was ‘formally investigating two companies following allegations in the Daily Mail that personal data was shared inappropriately and without the consent of users’. George Kidd, the chief commissioner, said: ‘The allegations in the Daily Mail are serious. People must be able to trust those with whom they share their data. We will look carefully at the roles and conduct of these two companies and advise the Direct Marketing Association on our findings quickly.’ The firms are already at the centre of a major probe by the Information Commissioner’s Office, which said the sale of such details was ‘on the face of it, a very serious breach of the Data Protection Act’. In meetings covertly filmed by our reporters, bosses at B2C Data were seen boasting of how they held thousands of details on every family in Britain. One, Gareth Doran, boasted: ‘We know what clothes they buy, what health products they buy, where they go on holiday, how many times they go on holiday, what income they’ve got, whether they have children.’ Data Bubble bosses offered to provide our reporters with the names of people with ‘different ailments’ for around 16p each. When asked how the information was obtained, the firm’s owner, hypnotherapist Joanne Clayton, said: ‘It could be people who bought mobility products from a catalogue … or even if they’ve been on holiday and they’ve ticked to say that they are needing help on the flight with regards to that, we can then identify that they actually have problems with mobility.’ Both companies sold the records despite not carrying out checks on the Mail’s bogus cold calling firm. Had they done so they would have quickly discovered it was simply a website and was not registered or regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. The announcement follows calls – led by David Cameron – for a clampdown on companies found guilty of selling personal data without consent. The Prime Minister suggested on Monday night that the law would be tightened if loopholes were being exploited by unscrupulous cold callers.","Sequester is offering details of eating disorder sufferers for 12p a head .

"One season soon, there will be more people watching each Premier League match live in the USA than in Britain. That is the confident expectation of broadcasting titan NBC, who hold the live rights to show matches Stateside and have more than doubled US interest in England’s elite division in the past two years. In 2012-13, some 13 million different Americans watched at least one top-flight English game live. Last season that was 32 million — or more than one in 10 people in the US. This weekend, for the first time, reflecting their boom product, NBC have transported their entire Premier League production from their HQ in Stamford, Connecticut, to England. NBC host Rebecca Lowe has helped to improve coverage of the Premier League in America . Star anchor Lowe was at Turf Moor to present Burnley's Premier League match against Arsenal . Lowe was joined by former Wimbledon midfielder Robbie Earle and retired MLS star Kyle Martino . Lifelong Crystal Palace fan Lowe is married to former Cheltenham manager Paul Buckle . Star anchor Rebecca Lowe was at Turf Moor for Burnley against Arsenal, joined by former USA midfielder Kyle Martino — a pin-up at LA Galaxy just before David Beckham — and fellow pundit Robbie Earle, now based in Los Angeles. The trio, plus pitchside analysts Lee Dixon and Robbie Mustoe, will also be at the Manchester derby at Old Trafford on Sunday and at Anfield for Liverpool-Newcastle on Monday. ‘The Premier League sells itself with its drama,’ says Lowe, 34, a former BBC and ESPN journalist snapped up to be the face of the PL in the USA by NBC two years ago. ‘But you can always enhance your coverage and that’s why we’re here this weekend.’ Lowe herself is a lifelong Crystal Palace fan, and had one eye on their stunning 4-1 win at Sunderland. As she told the LA Times recently, tongue in cheek, her support of Palace is not a sign that she can’t recognise good football. ‘I hope that people look at me and say she actually knows football because to be a Crystal Palace fan, you have to really want to be in football,’ she said. ‘It’s not easy being a Crystal Palace fan. I could pick United or City or Chelsea or Arsenal and I probably would have had a much happier childhood.’ Lowe now finds herself helping to influence the footballing choices of young Americans. ‘When I first moved to the States two years ago I hardly saw a [replica] Premier League shirt,’ she says. ‘Now they’re all over the place, and not just the big teams.’ Lowe was at Turf Moor to see Arsenal claim all three points thanks to a goal by Aaron Ramsey . Lee Dixon provided pitchside analysis for NBC as his former side defeated relegation candidates Burnley . NBC transported their entire Premier League production from their HQ in Stamford, Connecticut, to England for this weekend's round of matches . Every match is shown live in the USA. At 7am eastern time on Saturday, midday in Britain, NBC’s weekend PL broadcasting opened with a long shot of Turf Moor set against the Lancashire hills and Lowe describing how football has been played at this ground since 1883. ‘This country is so rich in history, it’s part of the appeal,’ says Lowe, a Londoner who is married to football manager Paul Buckle, who recently parted company with Cheltenham. ‘It’s important that we do tell our audience about [smaller clubs like] Burnley because otherwise it could all be Arsenal, United, City, Chelsea, Liverpool,’ Lowe says. ‘We’re passionate about educating and informing our audience.’ Martino says that when NBC won the rights to show games — for the three-year period, 2013-16, for $250 million (£167m) — some critics feared that showing every match ‘was going to be overkill … [but] what we’ve found is there is a demand for that level of consumption of this product’. The USA is the third most lucrative market now for the League in rights terms, among 84 separate overseas contracts covering 212 territories. Only Thailand, where broadcasters are paying $320m for the current three years and the Middle East (both £213m), offer richer pickings, so far. With the Premier League having recently sealed their record £5bn domestic TV deal for 2016-19 with Sky and BT, attention will now turn to all the overseas deals, to be brokered over the next year. India will be a key market, with a surging middle-class interest, while Malaysia, Indonesia and Brazil are seen as having room for growth, among others. All the overseas rights combined fetched £2.23bn for the League for the 2013-16 period (or £743m a year) with increases expected. The USA is high on the list of places the League want to continue building interest, not just to earn more TV cash but to provide the clubs with potentially lucrative markets. Burnley’s chief executive Lee Hoos, an American, told the Mail on Sunday on Saturday that his club’s merchandise sales in the USA have jumped 212 per cent this season simply by being in the League. Leaps of 150 per cent have been recorded in places as far flung as Korea and mainland Europe. Lowe would have been delighted with Crystal Palace's emphatic 4-1 league win over Sunderland . Burnley have benefitted from the American audience taking an interest in the Premier League, says Lee Hoos . Burnley chief Hoos, pictured withSportsmail's Nick Harris, insists his club's profile is high across the globe . Arsenal chief executive Ivan Gazidis has been impressed with NBC's coverage of the Premier League . ‘There are still people here in the UK who will say to me, “Where exactly is Burnley?”,’ he says. ‘Yet our profile has never been higher internationally.’ Arsenal’s chief executive Ivan Gazidis, who spent 16 years in MLS, said NBC’s coverage has been ‘transformative’ for the Premier League. He said in the recent past football was seen as ‘niche’ and ‘nerdy’ and ‘it was always cool to knock soccer … but when you get NBC coming into play you’re moving into the mainstream. It’s a sea change’. Three of the four most-watched Premier League games ever in the USA, including the No 1 match, Manchester United versus Arsenal in November, have been during NBC’s current deal. The biggest audience averaged 1.41m people — and that was before breakfast in many cities. The average audience in Britain for a Premier League match across Sky Sport and BT is little more than a million (and almost 500,000 in the US) and the biggest ever audience on Sky averaged below 3 million. United's win over Liverpool attracted 1.2 million on NBC cable and Spanish partner UNIVERSO combined . Manchester United's 2-1 win at the Emirates Stadium in November was the most-watched PL game in the US . Liverpool’s defeat by Manchester United last month had an average audience of 1.2 million on NBC cable and Spanish partner UNIVERSO combined. That made it the most-watched PL game screened before 10am in US history. The growth of the interest in America means numbers will swell there, with Martino believing phenomenal increases are likely. ‘NBC cover the Olympics, the NFL, they have been covering the big event for a very long time,’ he says. ‘It’s natural for them. It’s the same template [being used to market the Premier League]. ‘In the United States we talk about the NFL getting 19 million on a Monday night. That’s the bar set. And it’s not hyperbole to be ambitious — that’s what’s going to happen one day with the Premier League.’Liverpool’s defeat by Manchester United last month had an average audience of 1.2 million on NBC cable and Spanish partner UNIVERSO combined. That made it the most-watched PL game screened before 10am in US history. Jon Miller, NBC Sports’ president of programming, said: ‘The Premier League has a very passionate fan base here in the US. It’s also a youthful and affluent fan base as well, relative to other sports on television. ‘We have created a new “day part” in weekend morning television, where fans now come to our networks beginning at 7 in the morning and stay for 5-6 hours. It’s been a terrific partnership. ‘We believe that this is best soccer being played anywhere in the world and Americans gravitate towards the best when available.’",Rebecca Lowe has helped to enhance Premier League coverage in the US .

"(CNN)Two deputies involved in the fatal attempt to arrest Eric Harris in Tulsa, Oklahoma, have been reassigned because of threats against them and their families, Sheriff Stanley Glanz said Monday in a news conference. The deputies were trying to arrest Harris when Reserve Deputy Robert Bates shot him. Unlike Bates, they are not charged with a crime, but have come under criticism for pinning Harris' head to the ground as he said, ""I'm losing my breath."" Police appear on video saying, ""F*ck your breath,"" apparently in response. Sheriff Stanley Glanz didn't specify the nature of the threats, but said he was ""very concerned"" for their safety and that of their families. He did not say what the deputies had been assigned to do. Another sheriff's official said the office has temporarily suspended operations of the agency's drug unit pending the review of the April 2 shooting of Harris following a weapons sting. Glanz indicated he has not yet decided how to proceed with a review of their actions, saying any action may be delayed until after the court case involving Bates has been settled. Bates is charged with second-degree manslaughter in Harris' death. Bates, who is free on $25,000 bond pending trial, shot Harris with his handgun after calling out, ""Taser, Taser,"" -- an indication he planned to use a stun gun to subdue Harris following a brief foot chase with the other deputies. Amid questions about his age -- 73 -- training and friendship with Glanz, Bates has said the shooting was accidental, and has apologized to the family. Lawyer releases training records for Tulsa deputy charged in killing . On Monday, Glanz also apologized to Harris' family. ""We are sorry Eric was taken from you,"" he said. But he said his office holds itself to the highest national standards of policing, and said Monday that the FBI had cleared the agency of any civil rights violations in the shooting. Bates is white. Harris was black. There have been allegations, first reported by the Tulsa World newspaper, that some of Bates' training records had been forged, or that he was unqualified to be serving on the force. The sheriff denied those allegations, saying he was certain Bates had qualified on the gun range and had extensive additional training. He said he was unaware of any forgery involving training records, and said he had not issued any training waivers for Bates, with whom he has been friends for more than two decades. But he said he supported prosecutor's decision to proceed with the case. He also said he had brought in a Dallas police consultant who had previously examined the office's policies and procedures for another look. Harris' family has said the shooting reveals ""a deep-seated problem"" within the department and has demanded justice, and changes in policy.","Deputies reassigned after threats, sheriff says .

"Manhattan's Fifth Avenue was a sea of bizarre hats today as people celebrating Easter took to the streets in outlandish headgear. Whether they had just emerged from Mass, or were only there to bare their bonnets, the quintessential Big Apple thoroughfare thronged with color on Sunday afternoon. Bunny ears, eggs and flowers were among the more conservative adornments festooning the heads of New Yorkers as they milled around in a loose gaggle centered on St Patrick's Cathedral. Mad hatters: These parader-goers, pictured in front of St Patrick's Cathedral on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue, were among the more conservative hat-wearers in the annual Easter parade . Flower power: One of these floral bonnets, pictured next to the Rockefeller Plaza, spouted bubbles into the sunny New York sky . Classic: Some churchgoers wore more somber and refined clothing to the Mass service at the Catholic cathedral . Feathery: This elaborate piece of headgear was sported by Doris Watlington at the Fifth Avenue parade on Sunday . One woman wore a large ship with blue sails on her head, while another sported an elaborate diorama based on the policies of Mayor Bill de Blasio. As well as Christians emerging from the service, led by Cardinal Timothy Dolan, Jews, Hindus, agnostics and atheists joined the masses for a walk on the mild, sunny day. Roses, industrial-style black goggles, as well as moving rabbit puppets also featured in the display, which didn't just involve humans. Mary Ann Smith, a local hatmaker who wore the ship-shaped hat, said: 'It's all about versatility'. Explaining the design, she said: 'It's about sailing to new heights,' said Smith. She also created headpieces for two friends, one topped with a massive butterfly and another with a tropical umbrella dripping with felt balls and anchored to a bird's nest. Just feet from the parade, the trio was tending to last-minute finishing touches, adding bobby pins to make sure the contraptions didn't topple. Kirsten Lee Sergeant, who wore the butterfly, said: 'It's Easter and I didn't want to be too garish. But then again, I do have a huge butterfly on my head!' Ship-shape: Hat-maker Mary Anna Smith wears an Easter bonnet featuring a blue ship, which she fashioned from an elaborate kite . Elaborate rabbit: This puppet bunny was another of the out-there headpieces seen strutting down Fifth Avenue . Commentary: This woman's hat was a diorama inspired by the city's mayor, Bill de Blasio . Starting young: Maelie Swanson, held by her father Jeff, enjoyed the chance to put her bunny ears on parade . Onesie becomes twosie: This rabbit enthusiast was captured next to a mirrored building on the New York street . In bloom: These colorful headpieces were typical among the revelers . Eggstravagant: These two women took the egg theme to its logical conclusion, wearing depictions in cooked and raw form . The 2015 Easter Parade bore little resemblance to the first one, which started in the 1880s as a strolling display of what prosperous New Yorkers wore to Fifth Avenue churches. In recent decades, the street gathering has morphed into a sort of costume circus - including pet dogs. A sizable subsection of dogs also sported elaborate Easter costumes, painstakingly designed by their owners - although some were so heavy they animals had to be carried around rather than walk. Carmen, a 4lbs Chihuahua, was not exactly happy with her getup. 'She didn't love this one because it's kind of heavy, and she won't walk in it. But if I carry her, she's fine,' said owner Melissa Mejias. A consultant to the city's Department of Education, Mejias dabbles in dog attire. She used a Simplicity pattern to sew Carmen's coat from one of her old shirts, adorning it with a flowery headband plus a necklace purchased from a company that makes accessories for tweens. And to make sure she didn't run off into the dense crowds, Mejias kept her on a bejeweled leash. As for Mejias, she wore her mother-in-law's old Easter hat to the parade, a dark red velvet one she'd pulled out of a closet. 'I'm carrying on that tradition,' said Mejias. Dog squad: Carmen the Chihuahua poses with owneer Melissa Mejias at the parade. She was apparently not a big fan of the floral outfit, and won't walk with it on . Easter puppy: These two dogs seemed happier with their colorful wings and hats as they joined in with their owners . Kids, too: Sasha Bryant, left, and her sister India were also along for the parade, with relatively restrained toppings . Loopy: Davey Mitchell poses for photographs as he takes part in the Easter Parade . Rising roses: Pata Luna Llano poses for photographs with her elaborate, wireframe decoration . Back in black: Markus Kelle departed from the bright color scheme, opting for goggle-style shades, a black plume and purple lipstick . Keeping it straight: Terrie Furukawa, right, reties the hat of her aunt Yotsuko Sakamoto as they take part in the parade .","Brightly-dressed churchgoers were on display Sunday afternoon in New York City .

"A series of unpublished love letters from Mexican artist Frida Kahlo to her lover Jose Bartoli are expected to fetch upwards of $120,000 when the passionate missives go up for auction later this . During her marriage to muralist Diego Rivera, Frida penned the letters to Jose, a Catalan artist whom she met while she was recovering from surgery in New York. Their steamy correspondence began shortly after she returned to Mexico following the trip and continued throughout their secret three-year romance. 'I don’t know how to write love letters. But I wanted to tell you that my whole being opened for you,' then-39-year-old Frida wrote in October of 1946. Scroll down for video . Secret romance: Mexican artist Frida Kahlo (pictured) wrote passionate love letters to Jose Bartoli from 1946 and 1949 while she was married to muralist Diego Rivera . Enduring love: A collection of 25 of the unpublished letters will be auctioned off at Doyle New York on April 15 . She continued: 'Since I fell in love with you everything is transformed and is full of beauty… love is like an aroma, like a current, like rain.' The letters, 25 of which are headed to auction at Doyle New York on April 15, were written in Spanish between August 1946 and November 1949 and saved by Jose until his death in 1995. The archive of passionate messages, which comprise more than 100 pages, were passed down through different generations his family until they reached the current owner. According to Frida Kahlo biographer Hayden Herrera, the artist told Jose to sign his letters as 'Sonja' so that Diego would think they were from a woman if he came across them. High price: The letters (pictured) are expected to fetch upwards of $120,000 dollars . Pet names: Frida signed her letters to Jose 'Mara', which biographer Hayden Herrera explained is probably short for 'Maravillosa', a name Jose would call her . Creative couple: Jose, a Catalan artist, can be seen sitting at an easel as he works on a painting . Handle with care: This letter from the archive shows a stain on the right hand corner of the paper . Famous works: In this letter, Frida refers to 'Tree of Hope', a painting she created shortly after she met Jose . Diego, a muralist and a notorious Lothario, who once had an affair with Frida's younger sister Cristina, endured Frida's love affairs with women, but her relationships with other men would drive him to bouts of crazed jealousy. Meanwhile, Frida inscribed her letters with the name 'Mara', which Hayden explained is probably short for 'Maravillosa', a name Jose would call her. The collection also includes an original drawing of a sleeping cat, pressed flowers, ribbon, beads and drafts of a few of Jose's responses. Frida's candid messages to her lover shed light on her important paintings, an unknown pregnancy and her relationship with Diego, as well as her adoration for her Jose. Full package: The letters also include an original drawing of a sleeping cat and drafts of a few of Jose's responses . Sketch artist: Frida sent Jose this drawing of a tree in reference to 'The Tree of Life' City living: Frida posed for this photo in front of a skyline. She and Jose met when she was recovering from surgery in a hospital in New York . Long distance love: Frida ended this letter to Jose with a kiss, leaving behind a lipstick print of her mouth . Their secret affair began when Frida, who was left a partial cripple after a 1925 bus accident, was recovering from a spinal fusion performed in June, 1946 at New York’s Hospital for Special Surgery. Frida's sister Cristina was the one to introduce her to Jose, who moved to New York after fighting in the Spanish Civil War. They fell in love during his visits to the hospital and continued their long-distance courtship after she returned to Mexico. After Frida sold her 1946 painting Tree of Hope, which was inspired by her recent surgery, she wrote to Jose about his words influenced her creation. 'I remembered your last words and I began to paint,' she explained. 'I worked all morning and when I finished eating I kept on painting until there was no more light. But afterward I felt so tired and everything hurt.' An artist's life: Frida was photographed holding this statue while she stood in front of a blue cement wall . Inspired work: Frida sketched this drawing of a sleeping cat and sent it to Jose . Added images: This letter featured a picture of a women sleeping in a bed while another walked away . Last words: Frida ends this letter by telling Jose that she loves him . Epic romance: In this letter Frida told Jose she loves him the way that he is . In the painting one version of Frida lies in a hospital bed, while another depiction of herself sits proudly while holding a flag. While painting the piece, Frida inscribed 'Tree of Hope Keep Firm' a line of a song that she and Jose both liked. According to Hayden, Frida wrote in several of her letters to Jose that she had missed her period, in a way that suggested she was in some ways hoping to have his baby despite knowing it was nearly impossible because of her spinal injury. 'If I were not in the condition I am in now and if it were a reality, nothing in my life would give me more joy. Can you imagine a little Bartoli or a Mara?' she wrote. New images: Frida posed in her house for this photo take by French photographer Gisèle Freund . Full of life: Frida can be seen standing in her garden in Mexico in this image shot by Gisèle .

"Following Raheem Sterling's interview on Wednesday, in which he said he was not ready to sign a new contract at Liverpool, blogger David Tyrer of Live4Liverpool gives the view from Merseyside. While I hate to use social media as a gauge of opinions, Raheem Sterling’s interview didn’t go down well at all. It was ill-timed and, regardless of what Sterling and his agent hoped, he didn’t come across very well. Some of his answers only fuelled the fire really. I’m hoping that that wasn’t the whole point, as we’ve seen these sorts of situations engineered by agents before. The interview has almost certainly changed the way the fans feel about him. There will be a lot of fans that are of the opinion: ‘let him go’. Obviously, with the caveat that we get our money’s worth! Raheem Sterling returns to Liverpool training after the international break and shakes hands with manager Brendan Rodgers . Sterling risked angering Liverpool fans after he said in an interview he was not ready to sign a contract . Sterling trains ahead of the weekend's game with Arsenal . It’s always disappointing when a young player gets his head turned, but there’s a sense of ungratefulness about the whole situation, considering how the club has nurtured him and paid him well throughout. Personally, I think he has the potential to be worth so much more than the £100,000-a-week contract he’s turned down. But it’s only that: potential. At present, he’s arguably in the top five best young players in the world but, obviously at his age, he’s also prone to bouts of inconsistency and prolonged poor form. He hasn’t been great recently and was awful against Man Utd. Sterling has been linked with a move to Arsenal - the team he is preparing to face at the weekend . Raheem Sterling played for England in the 4-0 Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania . And while I’d be willing to see the club give him £100k a week – possibly £120k a week - the club shouldn’t do everything it can to keep him. Definitely not. Liverpool fans have a popular mantra: no player is bigger than the club. Admittedly, we stretch the rules for truly great players (Suarez, a recent example) but Sterling is nowhere near. If he wants out, I’m sure the club will handle it the way they have before. Frustration over Sterling’s situation has been building for a while, and many fans are now of the belief that if he wants to go he’s welcome to. Personally, I don’t like players holding the club to ransom. He has as much chance of winning trophies here as he does anywhere (other than money-rich clubs such as Chelsea or Man City). Sterling did not have his best game in a Liverpool shirt during the defeat at Manchester United . Liverpool fans have a mantra that no player is bigger than the club . If Sterling was to move to Arsenal then it would not go down well with Liverpool fans . But if he does end up going, he’s worth a lot more than many established players. His ability is so raw but he has almost limitless potential. At the moment, we’ve seen it in fits and starts but even so, he’s easily worth £25-30 million. If I was FSG, I’d hold any interested club to ransom, though – double it. But a move to Arsenal wouldn’t go down well. Perhaps better than if it was Chelsea or Manchester United, but honestly there’s little Arsenal can offer that we can’t. Sure, they’re more financially stable but what – in terms of trophies – do Arsenal have to show for the last 12 years? Sterling speaks to the BBC and reveals he is not ready to sign a new contract . I think we’re somewhat ahead on that front. Much like Alexis Sanchez, any move to Arsenal will be more about location than anything else. People have drawn comparisons with when Suarez wanted to leave for Arsenal, but the situation is different. Suarez says he wanted Champions League football and we weren’t offering that at that time. Not only that, but Suarez was an established top-class player at the time, one of the best in the world. Sterling is purely potential and, given all the club have done for him (cliched, as that sounds), it makes little sense. If he’s going to be nurtured into the world-class talent he can become, it won’t happen at Arsenal. It may not necessarily happen at Anfield either, but a manager like Brendan Rodgers will give him the best shot of improving to that level over the next two to three years.

"An 11-year-old retired K-9 officer took his last ride in a squad car in a heartwarming farewell held by fellow officers and residents celebrating his time on the force. Zeus, a German Shepherd, was honored in a grand procession in Connecticut on Wednesday before he was put down because of a severe degenerative hip disorder and declining health. The tribute for the police dog, who worked with the Ridgefield Police Department for eight years as a K-9 officer, began around 4.45pm and ended at the Ridgefield Veterinary Hospital. Scroll down for video . Zeus (pictured above), an 11-year-old retired K-9 officer was honored in a special tribute on Wednesday by the Ridgefield Police Department . The German Shepherd, who served eight years in the force, took his last ride in a cop patrol car during the grand procession held earlier this week (Zeus pictured with Officer Shawn Murray, his former partner and carer after he retired) On Wednesday, ahead of the procession, the police department wrote an emotional message about Zeus on their Facebook. 'Today is the day we have to say goodbye to our beloved K-9 Zeus,' they wrote. 'It is an extremely emotional day for all of us. 'He was a fellow officer and friend. He will be deeply missed but never forgotten. Our thoughts and prayers are with Zeus, Officer Murray and his family during this difficult time.' During the grand procession, residents of Ridgefield lined the streets as they watched the cop cars drive by through the streets of the town.

Zeus was being taken to Ridgefield Veterinary Clinic (above) where he was to be euthanized . The vehicles traveled from the police headquarter and ended at the veterinary hospital. Residents held signs reading 'Thank you Zeus' and 'Zeus our hero during the afternoon. A flag was waved at half staff next to a draped black cloth at the department as Officer Shawn Murray, Zeus's former partner, pushed him in a cart during the tribute. 'This is an honor to be here for him during his last moments,' Chief John Roche told WTNH. 'The disease that had racked him had deteriorated to such a point where it was just so difficult for him to exist and continue on.' A flag was waved at half staff next to a draped black cloth at the department (pictured above) Chief John Roche (above) said during the tribute: 'This is an honor to be here for him during his last moments' In his eight-year career with the force, Zeus assisted with more than 250 narcotics arrest and also helped officers track down 50 missing or wanted individuals. The largest amount of narcotics he was responsible for seizing was ten pounds of marijuana in 2006, when he joined the force and was partnered with Officer  Murray who he continued to reside with after his retirement. The animal had to retire last May due to health issues, and for some losing Zeus is not only losing a coworker, but also a family member. 'He was in the yard when there were picnics,' Detective Scott Murray, Officer Murray's brother told WTNH. 'He played, he chased the ball, he did what all normal dogs do, what all normal family dogs do, except he had a job.' Following the special tribute, the police department wrote their final goodbye to Zeus. On Wednesday, the police department wrote an emotional goodbye to Zeus thanking him for keeping them safe .

"Earlier this week, Brazilian commuter Nelson Felippe was deeply offended by a scene he witnessed on a train platform. He proceeded to take a photo, and express his disapproval on Facebook, after which the image was shared more than 100,000 times in 24 hours. In the picture, taken on a train platform in Rio de Janeiro, two women hug and gaze into each others' eyes, but the source of his outrage soon becomes clear in a post that cleverly spoofs conservative attitudes. Brazilian man, Nelson Felippe posted this image, expressing his disapproval at the 'scene'. The viewer believes he is conducting a homophobic rant, as he mentions: 'They are challenging social conventions, and this can be dangerous' In his Facebook post, Felippe stated: 'I am not prejudiced, I think everyone does what they want out of your life. But I find it absurd that I should be forced to witness a scene like this. 'What one does in private is your business, but what you do in public concerns me yes. And I refuse to see a scene like this and consider it normal.' A man breaks safety regulations by standing with his foot on the yellow line . 'I do not wish ill of anyone, but people should be preserved. [They] are challenging social conventions, and this can be dangerous. Continuing with what the unknowing reader assumes at this point is a homophobic rant, the next part of the post starts to become confusing. 'If after a tragedy strikes, or worse, if someone dies, who will put the blame on who? On me? Worst of all is the example for children. Suddenly it becomes clear what Felippe, who works at the Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, is really warning against - with his tongue firmly in this cheek. 'What would happen to a child who sees this scene every day? 'Kids will think it's normal to wait for the subway on the yellow line. So, don't act like that guy over there. 'Follow the example of the girls.' It seems the Brazilian commuter was in fact observing a public transport safety regulation, which the man in the far top-right is clearly breaking. Felippe warns others not to follow in the delinquent man's footsteps. The post has received thousands of comments with users applauding his witty way of exposing homophobia.

"Meter Maids have a long history synonymous with the sandy beaches of Queensland's most sought-after holiday destination, but time may have run out for the Surfers Paradise bikini-clad icons. The 50-year tradition has split the Gold Coast community, with business leaders calling for the end of an era, The Sunday Mail reported. Started in 1965, Meter Maids were the brainchild of Gold Coast developer Bernie Elsey who introduced the initiative to stave off the bad publicity associated with newly installed parking meters. Scroll down for video . Local business owners have labelled Surfers Paradise Meter Maids as outdated and were no longer providing a service . The controversial move involved young women dressed in gold bikinis walking the main tourist strip and placing money into expired meters, according to the Surfers Paradise Meter Maids website. But local business owners say the group is no longer performing a public service as advancements in parking meter technology mean expiry times are not always displayed. They believe Meter Maids are violating the council's anti-touting laws by spruiking branded merchandise, which Gold Coast Chamber of Commerce president Peter Yared says makes the group a business now. 'I think it’s time they moved on,' he told News Corp. Started in 1965, Meter Maids were the brainchild of Gold Coast developer Bernie Elsey who introduced the initiative to stave off the bad publicity associated with the newly installed parking meters .

Gold Coast Chamber of Commerce's Peter Yared said the group were now a business . 'They no longer perform any service for the community... They don't do anything in the area except fleece tourists.' Mr Yared said Meter Maids were no longer relevant as parking meters were now electronic and they had not kept up with the changing times. 'We're trying to clean up the reputation of Surfers Paradise and a lot of the maids are foreign backpackers rather than local girls. It’s not a good look,' he said. But Surfers Paradise Meter Maids general manager Michael Yarwood told Daily Mail Australia the chamber of commerce was taking 'a terribly ill-informed position'. 'The tourists love and embrace the Meter Maids because they are quintessentially part of their Gold Coast and Surfers Paradise experience,' Mr Yarwood said.

"An Oklahoma jury today convicted a 17-year-old of first-degree murder in the shooting death of an Australian college baseball player who was killed while out for a jog. The Stephens County jury found Chancey Allen Luna guilty in the August 16, 2013, death of Christopher Lane, who was shot in the back while running along a city street in Duncan. The jury recommended that Luna be sentenced to life in prison without parole. Defense attorneys acknowledged that Luna fired the fatal shot from a passing car that he was riding in, but contended that he meant only to scare Lane. Scroll down fro video . Killer look: Chancey Luna (left), 17, is led from the courtroom to the jail in shackles and handcuffs after being convicted in the 2013 shooting death of Australian baseball player Christopher Lane (right) Heading for lockup: The jury recommended that Luna be sentenced to life in prison without parole . Belated apology: As he was being led out of the courtroom, Luna told reporters he was 'sorry' Reckless: Luna's defense lawyer contended that the teen meant only to scare Lane when he shot at him from a moving car . 'There was no motive, no plan to kill anyone,' defense attorney Jim Berry said during opening statements. 'This is a reckless action by a 16-year-old child.' The defense had asked that the jury be allowed to consider a second-degree murder conviction, a request that the judge denied earlier Friday. Second-degree murder would have carried a sentence of 10 years to life in prison. Luna did not testify and the defense called just one witness, Luna's mother, Jennifer Luna. In her brief testimony, Jennifer Luna said her son lived with her parents after he was born and that his father is in jail. 'I wasn't there half the time,' she said. She also insisted from the witness stand that her boy would never hurt anyone intentionally. 'If my son did it, it wasn't on purpose. It wasn't meant to be. My son would never intentionally try to hurt somebody at all.' Dressed in a blue button-down shirt and a striped tie, Chancey Luna was stoned-faced when the jurors announced the guilty verdict. Satisfied: Donna Lane, left, the victim's mother, was pleased with the verdict, saying in reference to Luna that the 'naughty boy' will never hurt another family again .

Jennifer Luna, Chancey's mother picture din court Friday, testified that her son would never hurt someone intentionally . However, as he was being led in handcuffs and shackles out of the courtroom, the teenager told a swarm of reporters he was 'sorry.' Lane's parents and sister, who had read heartbreaking victim impact statements before the verdict was announced, expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the trial. 'This naughty boy is never going to do this to any other family,' Donna Lane told the media, according to Sydney Morning News. A co-defendant in the case, James 'Bug' Edwards Jr., now 17, testified that he was a passenger in the car when it swerved toward Lane, and Luna fired the shot. Edwards testified as part of a plea agreement in which a first-degree murder charge against him was reduced to being an accessory after the fact. Parents: Donna Lane, pictured left in court Thursday wiped tears from her face when prosecutors showed jurors a photo of the bloody T-shirt her son was wearing. Jennifer Luna (right) said her son lived with her parents and she was not there 'half the time' The car's driver, Michael Jones, now 19, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder as part of a plea bargain, but refused to testify for the prosecution. He is serving a life sentence with the possibility of parole. The doctor who performed the autopsy on Lane testified that even immediate medical attention would not have saved his life. 'Apart from a miracle, no,' said Dr. Inas Yacoub, a forensic pathologist with the state medical examiner's office. Yacoub testified that a .22-caliber bullet was recovered from Lane's body. Star-crossed lovers: Luna and his American girlfriend, Sarah Harper, had returned from a trip to Australia just two days before he was gunned down while out jogging . Torn apart: Lane, from Melbourne, Australia, was visiting his girlfriend, Sarah Harper, and her family in Duncan when he was killed . 'Despite being small, it damaged vital structures and caused significant bleeding,' Yacoub told jurors, striking two major blood vessels, puncturing both lungs and breaking two ribs. The victim's mother, Donna Lane, wiped tears from her face when prosecutors showed jurors a photo of the bloody T-shirt her son was wearing. Lane and family members also wept during testimony by witnesses who tried to comfort Lane as he lay dying. Lane, from Melbourne, Australia, was in Oklahoma on a college baseball scholarship. He was a catcher and preparing for his senior year at East Central University in Ada and was visiting his girlfriend and her family in Duncan when he was shot.","Oklahoma jury convicted 17-year-old Chancey Allen Luna of first-degree murder in 2013 killing of Christopher Lane .

"A giant supervoid 1.8 billion light-years across may be responsible for a mysterious ‘Cold Spot’ in the universe. The theory was proposed by astronomers seeking to understand what is causing this larger-than-expected cold area. If confirmed, the supervoid would be the largest single structure ever found by humanity. Hawaii scientists say a supervoid may account for an anomaly in the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) of the universe, shown bottom right. In 2004 astronomers first found the 'Cold Spot' - a region 20 per cent less dense than elsewhere - and may now have an explanation for its formation . The research, published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, was carried out by the Institute for Astronomy at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. The Cold Spot was first discovered by astronomers in 2004 when they were examining a map of the radiation left over from the Big Bang - the cosmic microwave background (CMB) - made using Esa's Planck telescope. In the map, the universe is fairly evenly distributed, apart from in this one area. The huge unexpected region contains about 20 per cent less matter than other regions of the universe and about 10,000 less galaxies. While other sparse regions have been discovered, nothing on this scale has been found before. ‘Statistically, we are very confident that the supervoid is there,’ Dr András Kovács, who was involved in the study, told MailOnline. He said that the supervoid appears to be ‘roughly spherical’, and it may even contain a ‘significant substructure’ at its centre; a void within a void. A supervoid is not empty, but rather a region of space that has less matter than other parts of the universe. For this reason it can ‘sap’ the energy of light that is passing through it. To explain how that works, imagine the void to be a hill. As light enters the void and travels towards its middle, it can be said to be climbing the hill, using up energy. Once it passes the centre, it would begin ‘descending’ the hill and regain the energy it expended to get there. But as the universe is expanding, by the time the light gets to the centre, its route out has become ‘shallower’ - or less dense. This means it cannot regain as much energy as it lost initially and leaves the void with less energy, therefore a longer wavelength, which corresponds to a colder temperature. The different is marginal - typically about 70 nano-Kelvins - but it is enough to stand out when the entire cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) of the universe is measured. The supervoid is thought to be causing a 'less-dense' region of the universe (illustration of empty space shown). At 1.8 billion light-years across it would be the biggest object ever found. But some 'exotic physics' is also needed to explain what's happening . The huge unexpected Cold Spot region, shown, contains about 20 per cent less matter than other regions of the universe, and about 10,000 less galaxies. While other sparse regions have been discovered, nothing on this scale has been found before . The original theory was that the Cold Spot originated from the Big Bang, and was a rare sign of 'exotic physics' that our current models of the universe could not explain. This new theory, however, suggests otherwise. Previous attempts to find a void at the distance of the Cold Spot were unsuccessful, but this latest study suggests it is actually a foreground object, three billion light-years from Earth. According to lead researcher Dr Istvan Szapudi, the object - if confirmed - would be ‘the largest individual structure ever identified by humanity.’ The team gathered data using Hawaii’s Pan-Starrs1 (PS1) telescope on Haleakala, Maui, and Nasa’s Wide Field Survey Explorer (Wise) satellite. The findings by the researchers were made using Nasa’s orbiting Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (Wise) telescope (artist's illustration shown), which was launched on 14 December 2009, and Hawaii’s Pan-Starrs1 (PS1) telescope on Haleakala, Maui . However, the supervoid can only account for about half of the entire Cold Spot, suggesting there might still be some exotic physics at play. The researchers note, though, that it is ‘very unlikely’ that the supervoid and the Cold Spot being in the same location are a coincidence. They are continuing to study the void with improved data from PS1, and from the Dark Energy Survey being conducted with the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile.",Hawaii scientists say a supervoid may account for a cosmic anomaly .

"Hassan Munshi, one of two teenagers feared to have crossed into Syria to join ISIS, is believed to be a relative of Hammaad Munshi (pictured) The families of two teenage boys who are thought to have traveled to Syria are 'in a state of profound shock' and deeply worried about the safety of their 'ordinary Yorkshire lads'. The boys who have been named as 17-year-olds Hassan Munshi and Talha Asmal are believed to have traveled to the embattled country after heading to Turkey on March 31. Hassan is supposedly related to Hammaad Munshi, who was arrested by counter-terrorism police at the age of 15 back in 2006. He was later convicted over his role in a brutal plan to murder non-Muslims,The Times reported. A statement released on behalf of the two families said: 'Both families are devastated by the events of the last few days and in particular, we are extremely concerned about the safety and well-being of our loved ones. 'Our number one priority is to get Hassan and Talha back home with their families and we implore anyone who may have any information whatsoever to get in contact with the police. 'Naturally, we are in a state of profound shock and are trying to come to terms with the predicament we find ourselves in and we hope and pray that no other family finds itself in our situation.' The pair from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, have not been in contact with their families for several days and cannot be reached on their mobile phones. Hassan's alleged relative Hammaad was only 15-years-old when he joined a terrifying Islamic State faction who were targeting the Royal Family. Hammaad was arrested on his way home from a chemistry exam in 2006 and found with two bags of ball-bearings - key material for a suicide vest. He was locked up for two years under the Terrorism Act in 2008. The statement added: 'These were just two ordinary Yorkshire lads who enjoyed the things that all young people enjoy at their age. 'Both Hassan and Talha had a promising future as an apprentice and an A-level student respectively, and we are praying they will be back with us soon and are able to realise that future. 'We would implore all parents to be extra vigilant, although as we found, it's near impossible to know your children have been groomed and brainwashed. 'Syria is a frightening war-torn place and we need to urgently educate our young children about the dangers posed by those who prey on impressionable teenagers.' The Times now reports that the two 17-year-old boys told their relatives they were going on a school trip - but instead used the Easter holidays as a 'window of opportunity' to flee Britain. They are thought to have boarded a Thomas Cook flight from Manchester Airport to Dalaman in Turkey on March 31, said West Yorkshire Police. Both families have reported the boys missing to police although British authorities now fear that the pair have managed to cross into Syria from Turkey. Scroll down for video . 'Seeking jihad': Two teenage boys from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, are believed to have fled to Syria to join Isis militants, seen here taking control of the Yarmouk refugee camp in Damascus . A family friend said they were in a state 'of total disbelief' and they were 'broken and inconsolable'. The south Dewsbury area has been linked to a number of extremist plots and was home to the ring-leader of the London bombings on July 7, 2005, Mohammad Sidique Khan. According to The Times, a member of one of the families said: 'We don't want to talk.' Assistant Chief Constable Mark Milsom, from West Yorkshire Police said: 'We are extremely concerned for the safety of these two boys and would urge anyone with information to come forward and speak to us. 'Syria is an extremely dangerous place and the public will be aware of the dangers these boys may face. 'The choice of returning home from Syria is often taken away from those that come under the control of Islamic State, leaving their families in the UK devastated and with very few options to secure their safe return.' The force said it has been supporting the missing teenagers' families and carrying out extensive inquiries alongside the North East Counter Terrorism Unit. The disappearance of the two teenagers follows the arrest of nine Britons by Turkish authorities attempting to sneak into Syria across the Turkish border. The boys are from the same town as London 7/7 suicide bomber Mohammed Siddique Khan (pictured) Waheed Ahmed, 21, from Rochdale was arrested with his aunt, cousins and four children while attempting to get into Syria. After the arrest, anti-terror police raided the home of his father, Shakil Ahmed, a respected Labour councillor for the town. Munshi's family comes from Dewsbury in West Yorkshire, where his grandfather Yakub Munshi ran the town's sharia court. The schoolboy, who was studying for his GCSEs at Westborough High School in Kirklees, West Yorkshire, was traced through his online conversations with 'cyber terrorist' Aabid Hussain Khan. In one MSN chat, they argued how best to sneak a metal sword through airport security. Munshi had painstakingly scoured the internet for details on how to make napalm and grenades. He claimed he had only done the research out of curiosity but handwritten notes hidden under his bed revealed his burning desire to travel abroad to become a martyr. Munshi also had a library of videos, documents and audio clips showing acts of jihad, mujaheddin fighters and Al Qaeda preachings. Khan, who acted as an administrator on an extremist website called Activion Publications, downloaded information on the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Charles and Camilla, Prince Edward, the Countess of Wessex, The Duke of York and the Princess Royal. Munshi was convicted of making a record of information likely to be useful in terrorism. Khan was found guilty of possessing articles for a purpose connected with terrorism but cleared of a similar charge. A third man, Sultan Muhammad from Manningham, West Yorkshire - Khan's cousin - was convicted of three similar charges and one of making a record of information likely to be useful in terrorism.","Families of Hassan Munshi and Talha Asmal, both 17, released statement .

"Jenson Button believes McLaren now have their rivals in their sights ahead of this weekend's Chinese Grand Prix. After starting the new Formula One season in Australia with a severe lack of pace, McLaren and new power-unit supplier Honda made significant progress a fortnight later in Malaysia. Although both Button and team-mate Fernando Alonso retired during the race at the Sepang International Circuit, the duo at least discovered the car was competitive alongside other midfield runners. Jenson Button looks on in the garage during final practice for last month's Malaysian Grand Prix . That came as a pleasant surprise to Button, who is now hoping further steps have been taken going into this weekend's race in Shanghai. 'Obviously we want to finish a race, but seeing improvement in pace was much more important,' said Button. 'Yes, we both had failures, but I'd rather that with us pushing and trying to get more power out of the car than trotting around at the back and simply getting to the end. 'To be able to race other cars, and see the Red Bulls until a long way into the race, was good. 'We would probably have been 20 seconds behind them. I know they're not quick, but that is a good step forward for us. Button returns to the McLaren garage after retiring during the race at the Sepang circuit . 'Right now we're comparing ourselves with the Force Indias, Saubers and Lotuses. 'We were quicker than Force India; the Sauber was on the same sort of pace, and the Lotus wasn't that much quicker. 'Fighting with the pack is important for me. It's what I enjoy and hopefully race by race we'll start picking them off.' Despite the positives, Button acknowledges the entire team, including Honda, 'still has a long way to go'. British driver Button in action before he retired from the Malaysian Grand Prix . Button added: 'We need and want more downforce to fight with the guys around us, and we still have a lot to do with the power unit, but our basic car is good. 'If you look at our high-speed pace, compared to the Force India and Sauber, then we are much stronger. 'So we're moving in the right direction, and I'm already surprised we are racing cars. It's great to see.' Part of the reasoning behind McLaren's improvement in Malaysia, in comparison to Australia, was the high temperatures which suited the car. McLaren driver Fernando Alonso (left) drives ahead of team-mate Button in Kuala Lumpur . Button appreciates the cooler air in Shanghai could have an effect. The 35-year-old said: 'There is a feeling the expected cooler weather will make it harder to generate tyre temperature. 'That could mean any progress we make doesn't necessarily translate to a lap-time benefit. 'But there is definitely progress being made, and it's great to be able to play a role in helping move the whole team forwards.

"'Loneliness maps' are being used to tackle the problem of elderly people being left alone by working out which areas' residents are most at risk. Health experts have warned that being socially isolated can be as harmful as smoking 15 cigarettes a day, leading to an increased risk of problems such as dementia and high blood pressure. Now campaigners say that local councils should draw up maps of the places where pensioners and others are most likely to suffer from social isolation. Map: This 'loneliness map' was drawn up by Essex County Council showing the areas where residents are most vulnerable to becoming socially isolated . Two county councils, Essex and Gloucestershire, have already implemented the maps, which allow them to target 'danger zones' of loneliness. A new report from the University of Kent and the Campaign to End Loneliness recommends the maps as a way of treating the problem across the country. In Gloucestershire, council bosses compiled the maps by studying statistics on a range of public health factors which are often linked to lonely people. They looked for areas with large numbers of over-65s, people living alone, people suffering from mental illness, households with no car and people on a low income. Danger: Being lonely can lead to health problems including dementia (picture posed by model) The council also surveyed residents to identify those who rarely speak to their neighbours, are unsatisfied with their social life and say they don't have someone to talk to. They then combined all those factors to map the districts where people are most likely to be suffering from loneliness, with the most vulnerable areas marked in red. A spokesman for the council said: 'Targeting local people who need our help the most is a priority for us in Gloucestershire and we are always looking at new ways to reach them. 'The map we've adapted from a model by Essex County Council means that we can work out how many people could be lonely and where those people need us most.' The Campaign to End Loneliness has now called on other councils to copy the maps and draw up their own versions for their local area. The campaign's director Laura Alcock-Ferguson said: 'Finding people who are experiencing loneliness can be challenging, as they are often also some of the most hidden people in our communities. 'However, it is encouraging that, across the country, there are excellent examples of councils that are employing different strategies to identify residents most at risk of loneliness. 'If local councils and services do not act now to find the people experiencing severe loneliness, we are likely to see the consequences in our hospitals and social care services.' The report identifies a number of other risk factors that might make people more likely to suffer from chronic loneliness. People from ethnic minorities, those recently bereaved or forced to care for their loved ones and childless pensioners are particularly susceptible.",Local councils are urged to draw up maps of the residents who are at risk .

"Most people would sensibly keep their distance from a pool full of alligators - but this astonishing footage shows one adrenaline junkie precariously navigating a slackline over more than 50 of the hungry reptiles. Jason McDonald, 34, from Aurora, Colorado, walked the thin rope line over a pool containing more the alligators - some which measure up to ten feet in length - at the Colorado Gator Farm. Crematory manager Mr McDonald, who volunteers at the farm, has been involved with alligators for over ten years and has taken handling classes, said he thought this would be an interesting new way of interacting with the fearsome creatures. Scroll down for video . Jason McDonald walked the thin slackline rope over a pool containing more than 50 hungry alligators . 'I got the idea after watching my friend Josh Beaudoin, who likes to walk slacklines several hundred feet up in the air,' he said. 'I knew I wasn't at that level yet but that I could put my own spin on it and walk over gators. 'The gators are surprisingly ok with the slackline. 'The first time we set it up they approached but didn't get very close. This time it didn't seem to bother them at all.' Mr McDonald said that while his parents have reservations about his daring antics, he has plans to take his hobby further.

'My mother wants me to be careful and remember I'm a father but she also knows I'm good at working with the gators - and although it can be dangerous I do it as safely as possible,' he said. 'Going forward we want to walk over Elvis or Morris, our two biggest gators on the farm. 'I also think it would be cool to walk over the top of our albino gators since that would be hard to recreate since we have four, and not many people even have one albino.' Mr McDonald, who has been volunteering at the farm for 10 years, had never been bitten before last month - when an 8ft alligator clamped down on his hand for more than 10 minutes. Mr McDonald, who treats and cares for the rescued animals,  performs tricks for visitors to the farm in his spare time.

"(CNN)Former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez will need to keep his lawyers even after being convicted of murder and other charges in the death of Odin Lloyd. The 25-year-old potentially faces three more trials -- one criminal and two civil actions. Next up is another murder trial in which he is accused of killing two men and wounding another person near a Boston nightclub in July 2012. Prosecutors have said Hernandez fatally shot Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado when he fired into their 2003 BMW.  Another passenger was wounded and two others were uninjured. Hernandez pleaded not guilty at his arraignment. The trial was originally slated for May 28, but Jake Wark, spokesman for the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office, said Wednesday the trial had been postponed and no new date had been set. ""We expect to select a new court date in the coming days and then set the amended trial track. The Suffolk indictments allege two counts of first-degree murder for the July 16, 2012, shooting deaths of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado in Boston's South End; three counts of armed assault with intent to murder and one count of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon for shots fired at three surviving victims; and one count of unlawful possession of a firearm,"" he said. The families of de Abreu and Furtado filed civil suits against Hernandez, and a judge froze his $5 million in assets, pending the outcome of the double-murder trial. The freeze includes the disputed $3.3 million signing bonus payment Hernandez claims he is owed by the New England Patriots. Hernandez is also being sued by a man who claims Hernandez shot him while they were in a limousine in Miami in February 2013. Alexander Bradley claims the then-New England Patriot tight end wounded him after the two got into a fight at a Miami strip club. In a lawsuit filed four months later, Bradley said Hernandez fired at him during a limo ride after leaving the club and that Hernandez intentionally ""possessed a gun which he was not legally licensed to have."" Hernandez's lawyers have argued he couldn't defend himself properly while on trial in Massachusetts. There was no criminal charge in the case. And then there is the grievance over unpaid bonus money filed by the NFL players union on behalf of Hernandez, who signed a contract in 2012 that potentially was worth more than $40 million. If the grievance is heard by the league, Hernandez will be represented by the the National Football League Players' Association. Who was Odin Lloyd? CNN's Lawrence Crook contributed to this report.","Aaron Hernandez has been found guilty in Odin Lloyd's death, but his troubles are not over .

"French giants Paris Saint-Germain have been dealt a major blow with the news that David Luiz will miss the Champions League clash with Barcelona.

"The return of Game of Thrones has sparked a surge in internet piracy with fans making more than 100,000 illegal downloads per day. More than seven million episodes from seasons one to four were illegally downloaded between February and April this year as fans of the hit HBO show caught up or re-capped before its eagerly-return on Sky Atlantic on Sunday night. Figures by anti-piracy and security firm Irdeto revealed overall illegal downloading of show is up 45 per cent year-on-year, jumping from 4.9 million  for the same two-month period in 2014. Popular: Emilia Clarke as Daenerys Targaryen in the first series of the hit show. New figures reveal it is the most illegally downloaded show in the world . The top country for illegal downloads of Game of Thrones episodes was Brazil, which accounted for almost one million of them, followed by France in second, the US, Canada and the UK. The snapshot also revealed the top five TV shows illegally downloaded during the same period were period were The Walking Dead (5.7m), Breaking Bad (3.8m), Vikings (3.4m) and House of Cards (2.7m). Worldwide following: There were seven million illegal downloads of Game of Thrones, which features Natalie Dormer as Margaery Tyrel above, . Appeal: Fans of the hit HBO show have been rushing to download old episodes featuring Jack Gleeson as King Joffrey, left, and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau as Jaime Lannister, right . Lack of access for global audiences is used as a defence of pirates, as many of their favourite films and shows that debut in the US are delayed by weeks or months. So to make it easier for people to watch legally, HBO announced in March that the forthcoming season will air across 170 countries at the same time. This week the cable network also launched a new internet streaming service, HBO Now, in an attempt to curb piracy and recapture revenue, although it is only available in the US.

"Michael Phelps is aiming to compete in a fifth Olympics next year in Rio, although the 18-time Olympic champion won't swim in the world championships this summer. Phelps confirmed his intention to make one last run at the Olympics on Wednesday. 'You guys heard it here first,' he told reporters at Skyline Aquatic Center, where he will be competing in his first meet since serving a six-month suspension by USA Swimming after a second drunken driving arrest last fall. 'I am looking forward to next year. I don't think it's too hard to really realize why I came back.' 18-time Olympic champion Michael Phelps is aiming to compete in a fifth Olympics next year in Rio . But Phelps said he won't be swimming at the world meet in Russia in August as part of the punishment set forth by the sport's U.S. governing body. He had already qualified in three events before being banned from the last major international meet before the Rio de Janeiro Olympics. 'I really enjoy being on those trips,' he said. 'That's why it is painful to think that I won't have the chance to compete at worlds.' There had been informal discussions about Phelps being reinstated to the US team for worlds, but it would have meant removing swimmers that were named to the team in his absence. 'By no means do I want this to be a distraction from the team,' he said. 'No way would I ever want to displace a member of that team.' Phelps in action during a practice session Mesa, Arizona on Wednesday . Phelps is back in Arizona, where he attended 45 days of inpatient alcohol rehabilitation after being arrested on DUI charges in his hometown of Baltimore last September. He offered no specifics about his treatment, which he continued in Maryland. He also enrolled in Alcoholics Anonymous. 'The last couple of months have probably been the hardest I've ever had to go through in my entire life,' he said. 'I take full responsibility for all of my actions. I've hurt a lot of people and it's been terrible.' The 29-year-old swimmer was sentenced to 18 months of probation. He said he's done more growing up in recent months than he has in his entire life. 'I have been able to come out on a better end, have a clear head,' he said. 'I don't think I've ever been like this once in my life.' Phelps' longtime coach, Bob Bowman, acknowledged his star swimmer's second arrest for drunken driving made it 'pretty hard to convince me that anything was going to lead us back to something that we'd be proud of.' Phelps called Bowman a few times from rehab, which the coach described as 'really weird' because he typically never heard from Phelps away from the pool. Bowman visited Phelps during treatment, still skeptical that the swimmer was there for any reason other than he had to be. But Bowman left thinking differently. Phelps is back in Arizona, where he attended 45 days of inpatient alcohol rehabilitation . 'I just had no doubt that he had changed in a way that was really meaningful,' Bowman said. 'He was completely different and it's been that way every day since he's been back.' Phelps pleaded guilty after his first drunken driving arrest in 2004. Five years later, a photo was published of him using a marijuana pipe at a party, which drew a three-month suspension and caused some sponsors to drop him. Phelps knows not everyone will believe he's contrite and has changed. 'If somebody doesn't believe the words that are coming out of my mouth that's their choice,' he said. 'I, of course, would like to show everybody in the world that I am in a different place and I am much better than I ever have been. I understand that's going to take a lot of time. This week will be the first week that I can start that.' Phelps will be competing in Mesa for the first time since the Pan Pacific Championships last August. The Arizona meet was where Phelps made his comeback a year ago after an extended retirement following the 2012 Olympics. Phelps adjusts North Baltimore Aquatic Center team-mate Allison Schmidt's cap during practice . He isn't sure what to expect, having only recently returned to the kind of hard training he did before the 2008 Beijing Games, where he won a record eight gold medals. Phelps is falling back on the mentality he used for much of his career. 'I would just get up and swim as hard as I could and leave it in the water,' he said. 'That's what I'm going to do here. I know I'm more prepared now than I was at this time last year.' His first event is the 100-meter butterfly on Thursday, when he'll compete against longtime rival Ryan Lochte. Phelps is surrounding himself with familiar faces this week, including his fiancee Nicole Johnson and family members. 'I'm a lot happier and in a lot better state and in a lot better physical shape than I really have been in a long time,' he said.",Michael Phelps is hoping to compete a the 2016 Olympics in Rio .

"Out there in the desert, the mirage continues to shimmer for Amir Khan. The identity of the challenge becomes blurred in the haze. First it looks like Floyd Mayweather. Now he glimpses Manny Pacquiao. And in which oasis in the sand might he finally touch gloves with one of the two best boxers on earth? The initial lure has been Mayweather in Las Vegas, Nevada. Now the siren call is Pacquiao in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. For two years Khan has been so close to fighting Mayweather that he could smell the resin and hear the roar of the crowd. Yet each time he reaches out, the tantalising illusion fades and slips away like so many fantasies along the Vegas Strip. Now the image of Pacquiao dances before him and there is reason to believe that a tale which might have been told by Scheherazade could become reality one starlit Arabian night. After waiting and waiting for Floyd Mayweather, Amir Khan could be set to face Manny Pacquiao . A fight with Pacquiao, preparing to face Floyd Mayweather on May 2, is on the cards for Abu Dhabi . The handsome young prince of British boxing will pay a flying visit to Vegas on May 2, there to watch the PacMan and the Money Man dispute the richest fight of all time. Win or lose, Pacquiao could await Khan come winter. Sportsmail's Jeff Powell with Amir Khan . Bob Arum, the PacMan’s vintage promoter, has to hand a treasure trove of an offer for a fight in Abu Dhabi this November or December. Khan, the stand-by for Pacquiao had Mayweather refused the Fight of the Century, is Arum’s first choice for that extravaganza in the Middle East. Once Pacquiao’s sparring partner, now Khan says: ‘I want this fight. I would love to box Manny. We’ve been looking at an event in Dubai and Abu Dhabi is only a short drive away. It’s a dream of mine to fight in that part of the world.’ As a hero of the Muslim world, Khan would be a huge attraction there. He now has initials which are the Pakistan equivalent of a CBE behind his name. His father and mother have just returned from Islamabad where, on their son’s behalf, they received from President Mamnoon Hussain the PAPID - the President’ s Award for Pride In Performance. Arum is aware of that box office potential but also recognises the boxing qualities of the ‘nice young man’ from Bolton: ‘Amir has great speed. Maybe the only guy as fast as Manny. And his recent performances have been impressive. This would be an outstanding fight.’ Assuming that Khan wins his interim bout with Chris Algieri in New York next month, all that would appear to stand between him and his long-awaited mega-fight is the outside chance of a re-match between Pacquiao and Mayweather. Promoter Bob Arum (left), with Pacquiao and Roach after the 2009 win over Miguel Cotto, rates Khan highly . Floyd Jnr seems to have no great appetite for a second edition of May 2nd, even though a return bout might bank the man who nicknames himself Money another couple of hundred million dollars. Either way, Mayweather will conclude his enriching six-fight contract with the Showtime cable network in America in September. That timing rules out Khan as his opponent - yet again after two broken promises - because his strict observance of Ramadan would not end in time for him to prepare fully. But if it’s not a re-match and Mayweather finds another opponent, Pacquiao-Khan is a natural for both of them. Pacquiao prefers an early winter date for his second fight of a year and Khan says: ‘Late November or December is perfect for me.’ Furthermore, it is highly unlikely that if Mayweather beats Pacquiao he will want to risk his cherished unbeaten record for a second time against the most dangerous of all his opponents. Floyd Mayweather will end his six-fight deal with Showtime in September, which won't work for Khan . Pacquiao works out with trainer Freddie Roach at their base at Wild Card Boxing in Los Angeles . And Khan suspects that will be the upshot in Vegas: ‘I actually think that once Mayweather gets through Manny’s assault in the first few rounds it will become an easy win for him. ‘Manny has speed and power but Floyd has the defensive skill to avoid him and the brain and accuracy to keep picking him off as he comes in. ‘The longer it goes the harder it will get for Manny and if he is to win he will have to keep up the pace through every minute of every round.’ Khan has affection as well as respect for his old spar-mate, so it puts him in a curious position to realise that defeat for his pal would benefit himself. Khan believes Pacquiao will struggle more with Mayweather the longer their mega-fight goes on . So he says: ‘I’ll just watch it with a professional eye. And there is a chance that if Floyd’s legs really are slowing down that Manny will catch up with him - and he can punch.’ By way of further irony, Khan has been working lately to add to his high-speed aggression exactly the kind of patience he would need if he ever did fight Mayweather. Hidden away in a unit in a business park in Oakland, across the Bay from San Francisco, is the gym in which trainer Virgil Hunter hones the talents of Khan and his long-time protege Andre Ward, who will shortly make his own comeback from a long lay-off. Khan has to first overcome Chris Algieri (left), who was decked six time by Pacquiao, on May 29 in New York . But as his higher education continues under Hunter, he is buckling down. Partly in the knowledge, at 28, that these are his prime years and they must not be squandered. He says: ‘I’ve wasted the best part of a couple of years waiting for Floyd because I would love to be the man who beat the man considered the best pound-for-pound in the world. Now I have to make the most of every day because soon it may be too late. ‘Floyd and Manny are getting closer to retirement and if I don’t fight one of them soon it may never happen.’ That is one of the reasons why Khan puts on hold a Battle of Britain with Kell Brook, preferring to focus on selling himself in America and thereby stay at the front of the queue for a shot at Pacquiao or Mayweather. Kell Brook (left) is fighting Frankie Gavin (right) in the 02 Arena and Khan says he has to wait to face him . Does his May 29 fight with Algieri - recently floored six times by Pacquiao in Macao - help that crusade? ‘Algieri’s a better fighter than Frankie Gavin (Brook’s world title challenger next month). He’s world lightweight champion and he’s fought at a far higher level than Frankie. Kell can wait.’ Khan says: ‘Being at ringside (on May 2) will be a bit frustrating but I accept that this is the fight the whole world has been waiting to see. So no. I won’t be feeling any resentment.’ It is not much more than a half-hour’s flight from Oakland to Vegas. Amir Khan is hoping that the next time he takes to the air it will be on a magic carpet — to Arabia.","Amir Khan could be set to face Manny Pacquiao in Abu Dhabi, UAE . Khan's hopes of taking on Floyd Mayweather Jr in Las Vegas have faded . PacMan's promoter Bob Arum has a mega offer for a UAE fight late in 2015 . Khan is a hero of the Muslim world and his lure in the Middle East is clear . The Brit will be ringside when the Money Man fights the PacMan on May 2 .

"Stephanie Scott's devastated father has opened up about the grief her family is feeling as they struggle to come to terms with their daughter's brutal murder, which took place just days before her much-anticipated wedding.

'You walk around the house and there's so many little things she planned for the wedding,' said Mr Scott (left, pictured with Stephanie's mother and one of her sisters) The happy couple, Aaron Leeson-Woolley and Stephanie Scott (both pictured right), had sent out invites for their wedding day which was supposed to be held on Saturday . The high school where she worked turned into a memorial site after it emerged Ms Scott had been murdered . The ceremony was due to go ahead on Saturday April 11 - however cruelly the day before her remains were discovered by police. Ms Scott and Mr Leeson-Woolley had been taking dancing lessons together to prepare for their first dance as an excited married couple, according to Robert. But the moment when Mr Leeson-Woolley should have been holding his new bride during their planned first dance to a Keith Urban song, he was inconsolable at his fiancée's memorial. Ms Scott's father says he has been contemplating the afterlife since Ms Scott's shocking death, but is confident that his beautiful, sweet daughter is in 'the best possible place' after living a life full of love and happiness. 'When you die I don't know what happens really, but you leave this body and our spirit is what goes on,' Mr Scott told The Daily Telegraph.

Mr Scott paid tribute to his daughter, remember her joyful childhood from her birth in Sydney, early childhood in Sydney's St Clair and time on the land from the age of nine, living in Canowindra. She loved her family, drama, soccer and school - eager for every opportunity to learn. It comes after local Leeton parents expressed anger over the loss of their children's 'favourite teacher' as the town continues to mourn the death of Stephanie Scott. Stephanie Scott was a 'favourite teacher' to many students at Leeton High School . A week before students are due to return to class after school holidays, mothers have have taken to a community Facebook page to talk about how the 26-year-old's murder has affected their kids. 'Well said, my daughter has lost her favourite teacher, and she will never be the same,' wrote Glenda Goolagong. Meanwhile Jodie Salerno posted: 'Stephanie was my son and 2 daughters favourite teacher at leeton high this ... has put so much pain and sadness on our comunity [sic].' Ms Salerno told The Australian her three children 'don't want to return' to school because they are so upset over Ms Scott's death. This comes as police are due to begin an autopsy on Stephanie Scott's body to determine how she was killed. Ms Scott's remains have been transported to Glebe Morgue in Sydney, and a NSW Department of Justice spokeswoman confirmed State Coroner Michael Barnes has ordered that an autopsy be carried out this week. Detectives who are leading the investigation into the death of Stephanie Scott will reportedly make inquiries with authorities in the Netherlands in an attempt to run a background check on the accused killer. School cleaner Vincent Stanford, who moved to Leeton  from Holland over a year ago with his mother and brother, was charged with Ms Scott's murder on Thursday. A week before students are due to return to class after school holidays, mothers have have taken to a community Facebook page to talk about how the 26-year-old's murder has affected their children . Her body was discovered on Friday evening around 5pm in Cocoparra National Park north of Griffith, NSW . NSW Police will get in contact with their counterparts in the Netherlands to determine if the accused 24-year-old murderer had any relevant history there, AAP reports. Stanford has reportedly been uncooperative with investigators. Daily Mail Australia has contacted NSW police for comment. It has also emerged that one of the last actions of Ms Scott was to send an email to the bus company hired for her wedding, confirming transportation for guests. The revelation follows after police discovered the charred remains of a woman's body around 5pm on Friday after they were directed to Cocoparra National Park north of Griffith, NSW by  Stanford's family. It's further alleged a gasoline can had been found nearby. It is understood Stanford was familiar to the area and went on regular camping trips to the national park  on many occasions with his family.

"A down-on-their-luck couple from Ohio struggling with chronic conditions that left them unable to make a living were found dead from self-inflicted carbon monoxide poisoning this week, less than two months after their desperate pleas for help went ignored. Randy and Jodi Speidel, from Bellefontaine, created online fundraisers on GiveFroward.com and GoFundMe.com in late February begging Good Samaritans for financial help. Mrs Speidel wrote that they had been living without gas all winter, had no running water and were close to having their electricity and Internet service shut off. Hopeless: Randy and Jodi Speidel, from Bellefontaine, Ohio, took their own lives this week, more than two months after they created online fundraisers begging for financial help . Heartbreaking: The middle-aged couple died from self-inflicted carbon monoxide poisoning caused by two charcoal grills they had dragged into their bedroom . Last-ditch effort: Mrs Speidel wrote on GiveForward.com in late February that they had been living without gas all winter, had no running water and cut down their food intake to one meal a day . After having paid $500 to their landlord to prevent their immediate eviction, Mrs Speidel stated that they were left with only $33 to their name. To stretch their meager funds a little farther, the impoverished, ailing couple were forced to limit their food intake to a single meal a day and did not have enough scraps to feed their two cats. ‘I have turned in every direction possible and don’t know what else to do,’ she wrote. ‘If you can help, we will be forever grateful and will even pay you back once we get back on our feet.’ The Speidles were hoping to raise $1,000, but the online campaign failed to draw any donations whatsoever. On Tuesday, the couple's landlord, Doug Elleman, arrived at their rental at 225 West High Avenue to discover a pink handwritten note warning passersby of carbon monoxide inside, reported Bellefontaine Examiner. Firefighters who were called to the scene entered the residence and discovered a pair of charcoal grills filled with smoldering coals. Jodi Speidel, 46, and her 45-year-old husband, Randy, were pronounced dead at the scene. Orpahns: The couple leave behind two daughters, Randa (pictured right as a baby with her father) and 20-year-old Kira Speidel . Columbus Dispatch reported that a note found nearby confirmed that the husband and wife had made a suicide pact. The couple had removed their beloved pet cats from the house to spare their lives. They were later found wandering outside. The couple leave behind two daughters, Randa and Kira Speidel. In a post left last month on her parents' GoFundMe.com page, which has since been removed, 20-year-old Kira called the couple 'the hardest-working people I know.' She went on to say that now that they can no longer work because of their physical ailments, 'they have nowhere to run.' Police Chief Brandon Standley said the town has resources available for people in need like the Speidels, adding that it's tragic that they thought they were all out of options. In one of her online pleas, Jodi Speidel mentioned she had applied for assistance and was told to wait. Her GiveForward.com campaign description indicates that despite her infirmities, Speidel was able to land a new job but needed some help to tie them over until her pay checks started coming in.","Jodi Speidel, 46, and her 45-year-old husband, Randy, were found dead in their Bellefontaine, Ohio, home Tuesday .

"Wladimir Klitschko has recalled his dramatic rise to the top on the eve of his world title defence against undefeated Bryant Jennings. The Ukrainian superstar will make his return to US soil for the first time in seven years when he takes on the slick Philadelphian at the iconic Madison Square Garden in New York. The 39-year-old Klitschko, though, has been reminiscing about how it all started for him when he won Olympic gold in Atlanta in 1996, instantly catapulting him into a hero in his home country over night. Reigning heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko (right) faces up to Bryant Jennings on Friday . 'I remember before I went to the Olympics and former Olympic champion in track running, [Valeriy] Borzov, he was Minister of Sports in the Ukraine said, 'Guys, you're going to the Olympics and one of you is going to win gold. That's going to change your life.' 'He was really right about it. I remember by winning the gold at the Olympics, when I came back home it completely changed my life. 'Sport definitely has power to change one's life and the world, as Nelson Mandela said. When I became champion of the world in the heavyweight division, that was 15 years ago, in 2000, and it was an amazing moment. Klitschko poses on the scale for the official weigh-in at Madison Square Garden in New York on Friday . 'I do remember clearly how it was and it was additional motivation to keep doing what I was doing. I was only 24-years-old. I mean, very, very young, but I took it seriously and I was working up to it and I believed that my work was appreciated with my success in the ring and that I became champion.' WBA, WBO, IBF and IBO champion Klitschko hasn't shown any signs of decline in recent times despite being just a year short of his 40th birthday. Still dominant and sitting high at the top of boxing's glamour division Klitschko believes age has no bearing on how long he can go on for. Klitschko will make his return to US soil for the first time in seven years at Madison Square Garden . 'I definitely think that age is just a number. Actually, it's a big advantage instead of disadvantage because with the age you're getting better. With the right lifestyle there's nothing that can go wrong,' he added. 'I'm really happy about the preparation [for this training camp] and I'm happy that I'm an athlete and I can get in the peak of my performance thanks to my experience. I'm looking forward to Saturday night. 'My sparring partners were 23, 25, 27, 29-years-old. It's amazing and interesting that considering my age, I used to be the youngest in the gym all the time, and now it seems my sparring partners are much younger than me. I see myself in them and we work very well. Former heaxyweight boxing champions Evander Holyfield (left) and Lennox Lewis were in attendance . Jennings, with a record of 19-0 with 10 knockouts, has been working on ways to nullify the well renowned Klitschko jab which he has utilised so effectively against past opponents. 'He has a great jab but I have an exceptional jab compared to his as well. He is one of the best athletes I've seen for that,' he said. 'There are definitely plenty of ways to actually get inside of a jab. Like lateral movement, head movement and relentless effort will definitely penetrate and make a change. 'I have 100 per cent confidence in everything that I do. I had a great training camp. The way that we actually prepare to manoeuvre around the jab, I feel is effective and I have 100 per cent faith in what we practiced. All I'm going to have to be is patient and be smart.'

"Bayern Munich may have been ravaged by injuries ahead of the Champions League game at Porto on Wednesday but the squad's sense of unity is stronger, Thomas Muller said on Tuesday. The Bavarians, chasing three titles this season, are without Arjen Robben, Franck Ribery, Bastian Schweinsteiger and David Alaba among others for the quarter-final, first leg in Portugal. 'For the (recent) games against Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen we had two matches where we played with a decimated squad and with few options,' Muller said. Bayern Munich striker Thomas Muller believes his team are stronger for their recent injury troubles . Muller celebrates his goal in Bayern's 3-0 Bundesliga win over Eintracht Frankfurt at the weekend . Bayern keeper Manuel Neuer whispers in Muller's ear during their press conference before the Porto game . Bayern beat Dortmund in the Bundesliga before edging past Leverkusen in the German Cup last eight on penalties and looked unaffected by the absences. They also beat Eintracht Frankfurt 3-0 on Saturday. 'In those games we came closer together as a group, as a unit, and that will obviously help us against Porto,' said Muller. 'Now it is not about the injuries but about building a strong unit on the pitch with the players who are there. We are confident and hopefully we can score a few goals.' Five-times champions Bayern will rely heavily on the scoring prowess of Muller and Robert Lewandowski in the absence of Robben and Ribery as they look to become the first team to beat Porto in the Champions League this season.

'They play an open game ... they have physical midfielders but with great quality. That is also their biggest asset. Their individual quality.' Guardiola added there was no point talking about the Bayern injuries, saying he would simply try his best with the players at his disposal. 'The last two weeks we talked about this a lot but we have this situation and we are here with these 14 players and we will try our best. That's what it is and I won't complain,' he explained.","Bayern are in Portugal to face Porto in Champions League quarters . Robben, Ribery, Schweinsteiger and Alaba are all out through injury .

"Huddersfield coach Paul Anderson is hoping to kick-start his side's misfiring attack to match the efficiency of their defence as they look to start climbing back up the Super League ladder. The Giants have plummeted from third to ninth after losing all three games over the Easter holiday period but they go into Sunday's home game against Catalans Dragons with the best defensive record in the league. 'There's no hiding away from the fact we are a very good defensive team, we've just got to get our juices flowing offensively more than anything and we've put some things in place to try and make that happen,' said Anderson. Paul Anderson is hoping to kick-start his Hudderfield side's misfiring attack to climb up Super League . The Giants have plummeted from third to ninth after losing all three games over the Easter holiday period . 'We know what we're capable of and we know we can quite easily go on a decent run. We had a poor start and a poor week because the games have come thick and fast. 'We've had some issues with our offence all year and I've got to take responsibility for that, because that's my role at the club, it's my job to try and fix it. 'If we were getting beaten by 30 or 40 points we'd have some serious issues. We just need to make sure we find our groove with the ball as well as we have without it. 'If you look at the last three games we've lost, if we'd have got one more score in every game we'd probably have come out winners - those are the fine margins that we're dealing with at the minute.' A first win in four would enable Huddersfield to leapfrog their French visitors, who have won just one of five away games so far this year. Widnes are the only team yet to take a point from their travels but they will be aiming to capitalise on their impressive record at the Select Security Stadium against Castleford in Sunday's other league game. Anderson says there is no hiding when facing Catalans Dragons, who have the league's best defensive record . The Yorkshiremen can climb to a season-high fourth if they make it three wins in a row and Vikings coach Denis Betts is expecting a stern test from Daryl Powell's improving side. 'Castleford have a solid squad who all know their jobs,' Betts said. 'They work really hard for each other in defence and that allows them freedom to express themselves in attack. 'We've had some really tough games against them - very competitive games.

Scroll down for video . A letter from Richie Benaud to an English fan, Jonathon Stevenson, almost 20 years ago emerged on Friday in the wake of the cricket legend's death . Accompanying the letter from Benaud, dated September 27, 1996, was a full sheet of notes about spin bowling for left-hand bowlers. 'Your letter was timely because it was the first from a left-hander and it reminded me that there is a difference in coaching and not just in the fact that one youngster might bowl with the right hand and another with the left,' Benaud wrote. 'The ball, although coming out of the hand in the same manner and going in the same direction towards the batsmen, in fact spins differently for the two types of bowlers.'

'Yes, the left-arm over-the-wrist bowler who spins the ball into the right-hander from outside the off-stump is said to have bowled a Chinaman. The same bowler who spins one away from the right-hander has bowled a wrong'un.' After retiring, Benaud became a commentary icon initially with the BBC in England and later in his native Australia . The typed letter, dated September 27, 1996, was personally signed by Benaud . It included tips on different deliveries  and gave pointers as to how they should be delivered . In his letter to a young Mr Stevenson, he listed a full page of various different deliveries the teenager should try and gave pointers as to how they should be delivered.

Citizens rallied to Mrs Bryd's side, saying that the town didn't even need as many officers as it had.

Despite the surge in crime and the comparatively large police force, residents told the TV station that they almost never saw cops patrolling the streets. Mrs Byrd told Daily Mail Online that the election of the first African American mayor should be celebrated instead of focusing on the departures of city employees.

"Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Marco Verratti has heaped praise on Zlatan Ibrahimovic for playing an 'essential' role for the French club. The 33-year-old striker has bagged 17 Ligue 1 goals for Laurent Blanc's side this season, but Verratti believes his input off the pitch is just as important.

"Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton haven't always seen eye-to-eye in the past 12 months but the pair appeared to be singing from the same hymn sheet on Thursday. Fresh from being beaten by Ferrari driver Sebastian Vettel at the Malaysian Grand Prix on March 29, the Mercedes team-mates have been collaborating with their team to ensure the prancing horse doesn't gallop to victory at the next race in China. The duo attended Mercedes' Brackley base in the hope to find a winning formula come race weekend in Shanghai on April 10-12.

Coming up with a plan to beat the red cars in shanghai! @MercedesAMGF1 @LewisHamilton,' Rosberg took to Twitter to upload a picture of he and Hamilton on a flight back from Brackley. Speaking after the race in Malaysia, Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff conceded that he was a worried man following the manner of Vettel's victory. Suggestions of another season of Mercedes domination in the wake of a comfortable one-two in the season-opening race in Australia were blown apart by Ferrari and Vettel. The four-time world champion beat Hamilton by 8.5 seconds, with team-mate Nico Rosberg a further four seconds adrift in third. Mercedes boss Toto Wolff (right) was surprised by Sebastian Vettel's Malaysian Grand Prix victory . Wolff admitted that the German driver deserved to win and Ferrari got their tactics spot-on in the soaring heat . Despite searing heat of more than 30 degrees, Vettel's Ferrari was kinder on its tyres, stopping just twice compared to three for both Hamilton and Rosberg. And afterwards Wolff admitted: 'We were pretty sure the three-stop strategy would work for us. 'We probably went a bit too aggressive on set-up, which pushed us into a direction of a three-stop. 'But in the circumstances, with the high temperatures, they were able to go at a faster pace over long runs than us. 'We need to analyse why that was the case, and it clearly shows it's not going to be an easy one. 'It is clear they won the race, which is worrying. It wouldn't be right to say we lost it.'

"Hong Kong (CNN)There's a booming black market in Hong Kong, but it's not for fake Apple Watches, or the iPhone. Instead, people are going crazy for tins of butter cookies. Tourists and locals line up around the block for several hours just to get their hands on Jenny's cookies -- at $9 a tin. Its popularity has spurred bakeries to make and sell knockoffs, and the original store has signs warning against buying 'fake' Jenny's cookies. The tiny shop, located in Tsim Sha Tsui, one of the city's main shopping districts, is swarming with people handing over wads of cash for the ""little bear cookies"" as they are known across Asia. People are even hired to stand in line to buy the goods and are later resold at a 70% mark-up yards away, something the bakery also tries to discourage. A few meters away from the long cookie line, old ladies hold up paper signs advertising the cookies for sale. But when they see cameras approaching, they scurry away, only to reappear on another street corner. The frenzy in Hong Kong over the buttery treats is by no means an isolated example. In other parts of the world, food mania has erupted, swiftly winning people's hearts and stomachs, only to fizzle out in a few months. From cronuts to ramen burgers, here are some foods that people around the world have spent hours of their lives waiting for.

"(CNN)This week, Hillary Clinton surprised the world yet again — not with the official launch of her campaign but for the unconventional way she did it. She sure pushed the envelope. With her video, new logo and road trip, she opened a long communications campaign not only to ""rebrand"" herself but to completely reframe who she is, what she stands for and how she intends to run. We'll find out over the next year and a half whether it will work. Many in the press and on late-night television scratched their heads this week; others were scathing. Ruth Marcus --  a  columnist for the Washington Post -- dismissed her launch video as a ""relentlessly, insultingly vapid"" effort of ""demographic box-checking."" Jon Stewart lampooned it as a ""State Farm commercial gone viral"" and also ""boring as s---."" Since the media will likely be the stand-in primary opponent for Hillary, their belief in her authenticity is a critical factor in whether she can reframe herself in voter's eyes. But from a marketing perspective, her launch may have been much more successful than critics think. The YouTube announcement video took on the central strategic challenge for the campaign and candidate: To flip Clinton's message from self-absorbed ""I"" to empathetic ""we."" While critics may sneer, it is hard to deny that the image it projects of Hillary is more confident, fresher, simpler and forward-looking, with even a bit of the upstart feel of two of the most successful product launch companies, Nike and Apple. Clinton's team may have begun to create an empathetic relationship with voters that has eluded her in the past, most crucially when she lost the nomination fight to Barack Obama in 2008. In marketing terms, rebranding is a strategy to bring a new name, term, symbol or design to an established brand with the aim of developing a new identity in the minds of consumers. Reframing is a strategy that goes further: it seeks to change how a consumer (or voter) emotionally experiences an established brand. A rebrand may change how you think about a brand; a reframe may change how you feel about it.  In the Apple case, the company at one time fell on its face when it unveiled the original Macintosh; some thought the company was headed for oblivion. But when Steve Jobs returned as CEO, he went back to the drawing board and soon unveiled the iPod, which not only changed the way consumers thought about Apple, but how they experienced it. Not only a rebrand -- but a reframe. Take Hillary's road trip to Iowa in the van nicknamed Scooby. The press lampooned her, but I would bet that for many others, her unscripted and anonymous stop at Chipotle reinforced the ""everyday Americans"" campaign theme. Hillary stood in line to order, an everyday customer among everyday people at an everyday fast-food chain. Also introduced last week was what will come to be the single most-ubiquitous element of her campaign: Clinton's new and controversial  campaign logo. It is a brilliant, iconic expression of the emotional connection she wants people to have with her, her message and her movement.  In fact, her logo is all about movement. Simple, confident, high tech and shorthand to a much younger set of voters, the bold red arrow moving left to right in front of the strong blue H says it all: You are the important ones. I'm here to support you with everything I've got. Let me help you move forward. Taken together, all the pieces of Clinton's announcement -- as well as the unconventional media she used to deliver them -- bring her back on stage not as a leader from yesterday but, surprisingly, as one for the future. Coincidentally, the way Marco Rubio announced his run for the Republican nomination most likely amplified the impact of Clinton's reframing. For all his posturing about being the new generation, Rubio followed to a ""T"" the most traditional script for announcing a candidacy: traditional stage and podium, dark suit, bright tie, wife and kids on camera, a live speech, all about himself, timed for the evening news. Rubio's logo, the signature of his image, drew immediate criticism for being amateurish and unconsidered, even leaving Alaska and Hawaii off the map of America. In stark contrast, Hillary showed the confidence and finesse to buck tradition on every front. It was Hillary who pulled the ultimate jiu-jitsu. There are those, of course, who will be alienated, if not disgusted, by the way her campaign has unfurled such a sophisticated marketing plan. In a day when voters are yearning for authenticity, how do we know this is the real Hillary or a candidate in a mask?  Fair question. But for better or worse, mass marketing has become the staple of presidential campaigns -- that's where most campaign dollars go. Both sides know how to play, sometimes brilliantly.  Remember the Reagan advertisements of 1984, proclaiming ""Morning in America""? What we know is that over time, voters see a lot of unscripted moments of a candidate where the real character comes through. And if they spot hypocrisy between ads and the candidate, that campaign will get into trouble fast. That's why the key to Hillary Clinton's success in reframing her message and movement will be consistency.  She must not only take the essence of a humble, empathic relationship with voters and integrate it into all elements of her communication, she must also live it every day. Otherwise there will be messaging ""schizophrenia,"" the solid start with flashes of brilliance will peter out and she'll be facing the same voter perceptions that doomed her race in 2008. In the meantime, one can imagine Clinton getting a huge, satisfying belly laugh out of the early returns on her efforts.","Martha Pease: Hillary Clinton got her presidential bid launched by reframing who she is, what she's about . She says Clinton took a low-key, unconventional approach, unlike Marco Rubio's standard announcement .",983163a6b3600a5329efbf4b57d13d9db0b6319b
"A woman who tipped the scales at almost 20st has shed nearly half her body weight after she was forced to stand during an 11-hour flight - because she feared she was crushing the woman in the seat next to her. Sharon Smith, 43, from Halesowen, West Midlands, was a bulky size 26 when she went on the business trip in December 2012 and struggled to fit in the plane seat. Today she weighs in at a healthy 9st 9lb and is due to run a 10k race on Sunday, when two years she would have struggled to walk half a mile, let alone run six. Scroll down for video . Sharon Smith shed almost half her body weight after she decided to take up running . Sharon said she lost 4st through joining a slimming club but then shed another four-and-a-half stone after taking up her sporty hobby. Her weight loss began just under two years ago when she joined Weight Watchers Online, but did not weigh herself immediately. After six months of following the plan, she was 18st 6lb so estimates that when she started she was 'way over 20st' and a size 26. She said that although she had always been larger she had never been happy being overweight. Sharon said: 'I was never one of those people who was okay being big, it had always upset me but my head wasn't in the right place to do anything about it because I had a busy working life.' She put her unhealthy lifestyle down to commuting to London for her job as a children's clothes designer for Aquascutum which saw her do minimal exercise. At her heaviest Sharon was over 20st and a size 26 but she has now slimmed down to 9st 9lbs and is a size 10 . But the turning point came for Sharon after having to 'squeeze' her bulky frame into seats on trains and planes. 'I started commuting to London in August 2012 and the business trip to Hong Kong was in December that year,' she said. 'I had been travelling out there for ten years but luckily I had always managed to upgrade or have no one in the seat next to me. 'But this trip coming back I was in economy and it is the one that really sticks out in my memory. 'I remember being rammed in my seat with a lady next to me. I felt uncomfortable not just for me but for her too. Sharon says her weight was down to to commuting to London for her job as a clothes designer but after quitting her job to go freelance and work from home, Sharon was able to exercise at lunch . 'I ended up standing for the entire flight with my iPod in. 'I was genuinely worried I might hurt the woman in the next seat because of my weight. She didn't say anything but I just didn't think it fair for her to suffer because of my size. 'The flight attendant even offered me the seats they use for take-off and landing. But with the big long-haul jets there is more room to stand.' But even back in the UK, she was fed-up of the daily humiliation of her long journeys to work. She said; 'On top of this, every time I went to London I was fed up having to squeeze into train seats.' Sharon made small changes to her lifestyle, such as walking around London rather than taking the Tube, and in January 2014, she decided to quit her high-flying job and go freelance. She began working from her home which meant she could go for a walk every lunchtime. Sharon took up running last March and by now was around 13st to 14st and finding it difficult to lose any more weight. Friends were talking about the 'Couch to 5k' beginners running programme so she started doing that and signed up for a 5k Race for Life, which she did last July in an impressive 40 minutes. After getting a taste for activity Sharon joined a runners' website, The Running Bug, which 'changed her life' as she was egged on by other enthusiasts. Sharon added: 'The site, especially the members' forum, gave me so many tips and so much encouragement.' Sharon took part in a 5k Race for Life which she completed in just 40 minutes . The designer has since completed two 10k runs last year and even ran the Brighton half marathon in two hours and 59 seconds in February this year. Sharon, who is also running the Morrisons Great Birmingham 10k run this Sunday, added: 'The weight loss really picked up when I started running, it really helped with the momentum. 'Once I started training for my first 10k race last summer, the pounds really dropped off. 'I think it was a mix of things that caused the problems, I knew my diet wasn't healthy. 'At the weekends I tended to graze the whole day through so there wouldn't be that many minutes when I wasn't eating, it was constantly chocolate and crisps. 'Now I don't buy any processed foods, I don't even buy ready-made bread and I try to make everything from scratch. 'I eat a lot more fruit and veg and try to eat health fats like nuts.'","Children's clothes designer Sharon Smith, 43, weighed over 20st .

"Armenia is a country in Eurasia's South Caucasus region famous for its mountainous landscapes and rich history ... but mainly, right now at least, for the fact Kim Kardashian and her posse are there. Kim Kardashian, her husband Kanye West, their daughter North and Kim's sister Khloe arrived in the capital Yerevan on Wednesday to a rock star welcome and over eight days are checking out a plethora of local landmarks. The visit is their first to the country their late father, Robert Kardashian, fled for America and both Kim and Khloe have expressed their excitement at the chance to explore his homeland. Kim Kardashian is in Armenia with her husband Kanye West and their daughter North on an eight-day visit to the country of her dad's birth . The celebrity visitors are in the capital Yerevan, a culturally rich city where the Opera House (centre) is among its most notable landmarks . The Yerevan Opera House is a must-visit place in the Armenian capital where local music and dance performances are highly regarded . Kim, Kanye and Khloe Kardashian are staying at the Armenia Marriott Hotel Yerevan which is on Republic Square, formerly Lenin Square . Republic Square is a tourist attraction in itself, with its combination of Soviet-era architecture and Neo-Classical official buildings . And from what Lonely Planet says of the city, it's made for the icons of modern-day entertainment. 'While it's the undeniable cultural, economic and political heart of the nation, Yerevan can at times feel like a city on permanent holiday,' Lonely Planet's introduction to its guide of the city. 'All summer long, Yerevanites saunter up and down the main boulevards, preening in high fashion and fast cars while occasionally popping into a parkside cafe to schmooze over a drink or two.' Sounds familiar... While there, the Kardashian-West crew are staying in the capital's finest digs, the Armenia Marriott Hotel Yerevan, which frames Republic Square at the heart of the city, and have the burliest of bodyguards and police in tow as they take in the sights. But what would we, the mere mortals not of reality TV fame, see and do if we followed in their footsteps? Yerevan's Zvartnots International Airport is well connected to major centres throughout Europe although cheaper flights (upwards of £300 during summer and less in colder months) from London require a transfer somewhere like Moscow, Kiev or Vienna. Without the need to book out the two executive floors of the hotel for our entourage and filming crew, as the Kardashian crew have, a standard room from 67,150 Armenian Drams is good value (sounds like a lot but works out at about £96). A smartphone view of the Katoghiken church in the World Heritage-listed Geghard Monastery, where Kim, Kanye and North visited . The monastery is a medieval set of structures which have in part been carved out of the mountain and date back to the fourth century . Documenting every moment: Camera crews followed the family as they took a tour of historical sites . Outside the Monastery of Geghard women sell the same traditional sweet bread that was offered to Kim on their arrival in Armenia . The hotel is well chosen by their people as it's right in the middle of this relatively easy to get around city, where the majority of main sights are free. The square is a tourist attraction in itself, with its combination of Soviet-era architecture and Neo-Classical buildings such as the Houses of Government and the Marriott itself, but with their own Armenian twists. In the heart of the cultural and business hub of Yerevan, the square is connected to the other main area of the city that has the impressive Opera House at its centre. While Kanye's hip-hop may not be the preferred genre of the nation - fans appear to be more interested in the stars of Keeping Up with the Kardashians - the city isn't short on culture with a disproportionately large amount of theatres, galleries and clubs for its size, with plenty of live music to be found. Their minders say the timing has nothing to do with it, but the Kardashians' arrival comes as the nation counts down to the 100th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide on April 24 which honours up 1.5 million people were killed by the Ottomans between 1915 and 1917. Turkey dispute the figures - they claim 300,000 to 500,000 Armenians died during a civil uprising against the Ottomans - but Armenians have fought for international recognition of the tragedy for decades. But the memory of those whose lives were taken are very much honoured in this city and throughout the country. The Cascades is the main part of the Cafesjian Museum, found in the centre of Yerevan, which features an array of  modern  Armenian art . Khachkars, an Armenian cross stone, are common features of medieval Christian art found in the Cascades . The Sculture Park features works from Botero and other internationally-recognised artists and a stellar view of the city . This statue at the Cascades represents Russian-born architect Alexander Tamanian, whose greatest work was planning modern Yerevan . Among the major sights on the Kardashian's itinerary is Yerevan's extensive Armenian Genocide Museum-Institute http://www.genocide-museum.am/eng/index.php along with the National Archives where they hope to see documents relating to their ancestors. The party has already visited Yerevan's Mother Armenia statue, a large representation of a women holding a big sword that is said to be the female personification of the country and proved quite an inspiration for the sisters. A visit to their father's home city of Gyumri would find a smaller version of the statue minus the collection of decommissioned tanks, rocket launchers and other military items. 'The Mother Armenia statue symbolizes peace through strength,' Khloe wrote on Instagram. 'It can remind viewers of some of the prominent female figures in Armenian history. Who took up arms to help their husbands in their clashes with Turkish troops and Kurdish irregulars. I am woman hear me roar! Blessed to be here!' Victory Park, home to the statue, also offers a brilliant view of the city . Kim echoed the sentiment: 'This statue reminds visitors of the strong female figures in Armenian history. I love how powerful women are and respected so much in our culture!' The huge Mother Armenia statue (said to be the female personification of the nation) and military museum at Victory Park in Yerevan . While there said to be more Armenians living abroad than in the country itself, due to millions who fled the alleged genocide, local culture has been diligently preserved. Their welcome to a packed airport included a traditional gift of bread and salt from women in traditional Armenian dress. Similar breads are found sold by locals at the Unesco World Heritage-listed Monastery of Geghard, a medieval set of structures which have in part been carved out of the mountain where where Kim and Kanye have taken North. The main chapel was built in 1215 but the complex originated in the fourth century and has a rich and varied history. Other sights include the 3,000-year-old Erebuni Fortress that was the beginning of Yerevan and the more modern Cascades, Sculpture Park and Cafesjian Museum, their modern art centre. Or romantics could visit Lover's Park, a Japanese-style garden which hosts open-air concerts and art exhibitions. While a minority are unimpressed with the celebrities' arrival most are delighted to see them, including the government. The group has met with the nation's prime minister Hovik Abrahamyan, who praised their contribution to 'international recognition and condemnation of the Armenian genocide.' Parliament speaker Galust Saakian said their visit can only be a good thing. 'Kim Kardashian is a lady who's known worldwide. We should be happy she came here,' he said. The Kardashian family tree has rich historical roots in Armenia . Robert Kardashian, father of Kim, Kourtney, Khloe and Robert Jr, was a third-generation Armenian American. The celebrity lawyer, who passed away in 2003 just eight weeks after being diagnosed with oesophageal cancer, passed on his pride in his heritage to his family, who have been vocal about their Armenian roots. Robert's ancestors fled the Armenian Genocide in the early 20th century, thanks to a 'prophet' who urged them to uproot to America. Known at the time as the Kardaschoffs, in Russian style, the family made their way from their home village of Karakale in the late 19th Century to German ports. From there, they travelled to a new life in America on the passenger vessels SS Brandenberg and SS Koln. By doing so, they escaped the triple horror of the First World War from 1914-18, the 'Armenian Genocide' starting in 1915 - exactly a century ago this year - and the Russian Revolution in 1917. Among those fleeing Erzurum - then in Armenia, and ruled by last Russian Tsar Nicholas II - was family patriarch Hovhannes Miroyan and Kim's great great grandfather, born in 1844. He married  Luciag Chorbajian, born in 1853. The couple wed in Erzurum, which is now in Turkey, in 1867 but escaped along with their daughter Vartanoosh Mironyan, born in 1886, in the early 20th century. Vartanoosh's distinctly blonde daughter Haigoohi Arakelian, known as Helen, was born in America in 1917, the year the Bolshevik Revolution rocked the Russian Empire. She was Kim's grandmother, who later married into the Kardashian clan. The glamorous and 'dynamic' Helen wed Arthur who ran the largest meat-packing business in southern California. Helen's son Robert married Kris Houghton and fathered the 21st Century's biggest reality TV stars Kourtney, Khloe, Robert Jr and Kim. Their mother Kris eventually married Olympic gold medalist Bruce Jenner and together they raised two more TV personalities, Kendall and Kylie.","Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, along with their daughter North and sister Khloe, are visiting Armenia .

"A couple who married in their teens and suffer from cystic fibrosis are in a race against time as the young wife waits for a life-saving lung transplant. Katie Prager, 24, was diagnosed with an infection in her lungs in September 2009 and is desperately in need of a transplant as doctors predicted she would not live a year without new lungs. As her health continues to decline, her husband Dalton, 23, who has already received new lungs, is pleading for help. Her insurance company, Kentucky Medicaid, will not pay for the out-of-state treatment she needs at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, he says. Dalton pleaded: 'They are turning my wife into a number, a statistic, a dollar sign. I cannot lose her. This can’t be the end of our love story. 'We are both ready to continue fighting but at this point we are running out of options and need your help. Please help me save my wife Katie.' Scroll down for video . Katie and Dalton Prager (above), who suffer from cystic fibrosis, followed their hearts and married as teens in 2011 . Katie, left, was diagnosed with an infection in her lungs called Burkholderia Cepacia, and is desperately in need of a transplant as doctors predicted she would not live a year without new lungs . Dalton has already received new lungs, but Katie is waiting as Kentucky Medicaid will not pay for the out-of-state-treatment she needs at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center . For the couple who put everything on the line when they first met in person in 2009, her husband can not imagine losing the love of his life who he married four years ago. In December 2014, Katie was discharged from the Pittsburgh hospital after a long stay and returned to Kentucky, but began having trouble breathing three days later. The hospital would not admit her because Medicare would not pay because she had used her lifetime maximum, the couple says. She will not be covered for the expensive out-of-state medical procedure again until she spends 60 consecutive days out of the hospital. She was admitted into University of Kentucky Hospital, but it however, does not do transplants on patients with the kind of infection that Katie has. 'Sixty days out of the hospital is not an option for her anymore. Medicaid is also not an option as it will not cover her transplant due to UPMC being 'out of network',' Dalton wrote on the couple's YouCaring page. 'After explaining to Medicaid and Pittsburgh that there are only two places in the country, who would operate, due to (the bacteria) Cepacia, (UPMC and Duke Medical Center) still refused to work together to help her. 'She is struggling to attempt to negotiate her healthcare options from her hospital bed at the University of Kentucky.' Dalton said: 'They are turning my wife into a number, a statistic, a dollar sign. I cannot lose her. This can’t be the end of our love story' Only three months away from their four-year anniversary, the couple has not been together since November 2014 when Dalton received new lungs, and hope they can be together to celebrate . Katie said that she feels like efforts to get transferred to Pittsburgh are at a standstill and that something needs to be done. 'It needs to happen soon. Nervous they aren't going to accept my case and that I'll have to restart this whole process at a completely different hospital,' she wrote on the couple's Facebook page. In February, Dr. Michael Anstead who is Katie's pulmonologist at the University of Kentucky, wrote a letter to Medicaid seeking for them to make an exception and pay for Katie's care in Pittsburgh, according to CNN. But Kentucky Medicaid denied the proposal saying UPMC declined to enroll as a Kentucky Medicaid provider. 'Medicaid policies allow for a simplified enrollment process for out-of-state providers in such situations,' Gwenda Bond, spokeswoman for the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services wrote in a statement to CNN. 'Should UPMC reverse its decision and choose to enroll as a Kentucky Medicaid provider, the Department for Medicaid Services...will be happy to expedite their application.' However, the hospital claims that Medicaid told them if they wanted to treat Katie, they would be required to sign up hundreds of doctors to accept Kentucky Medicaid patients.

So far, they rely on communication through their phones or computers. But all they want is to be able to spend their anniversary together. 'I just want to make it to see our four year anniversary in July and be able to hold hands and just hug,' Katie told CNN. 'That's all I really want -- to be able to hug my husband on our fourth anniversary.' So far, the couple's YouCaring page has raised $43,425 in donations out of its goal of $50,000.","Katie and Dalton Prager, 24 and 23, met in 2009 and married two years later .

"Child sexual abuse reports have soared since Operation Yewtree which was sparked by Jimmy Savile's assaulting of dozens of children . Reports of child sex abuse cases have risen by more than 60 per cent in the wake of investigations such as Operation Yewtree and the Rotherham scandal. Figures revealed thousands more people had contacted police with allegations of abuse since 2011, with nearly 9,000 reports filed in 2014. Despite a surge in reports, the number of arrests fell by nine per cent, prompting critics to accuse the Government of failing victims of abuse. Among the forces to see the largest rise in reported cases was South Yorkshire where there was a 577 per cent increase over the last five years. It comes after an estimated 1,400 children were abused in the area over several years, with officials in Rotherham ousted as a result of the scandal having been deemed not fit for purpose. While only 74 cases of child sex abuse were reported to the force in 2011, 501 were investigated in 2014, the figures, obtained via Freedom of Information request by The Guardian, revealed. But while a surge in the number of reports suggested victims felt more comfortable coming forward, a decrease in the number of arrests made prompted critics to accuse police of not doing enough. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper described the ratio of reported crimes to arrests as a 'national scandal'. 'This isn't a problem from the past. It is a growing problem the Government should be confronting right now. 'Victims of child sex abuse are being let down when alongside a 60 per cent increase in reports there has been a nine per cent drop in arrests for child sex abuse, as well as falling prosecutions and convictions for child abuse offences as the police are unable to keep up.' Shaun Wright, the former Police and Crime Commissioner of South Yorkshire Police, resigned over the force's handling of the Rotherham child abuse scandal . Thames Valley Police made 191 arrests in relation to child sex abuse - up from just 13 in 2011. Campaigners said the rise was indicative of increased awareness of child sexual abuse among the public. 'In recent years there has been a huge increase in awareness of child sexual abuse and it’s good that more people are coming forward,' Alan Wardle, NSPCC head of policy and public affairs, said. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the figures were a 'national scandal' 'Since the Operation Yewtree police investigation was launched in 2012, the NSPCC helpline has seen a huge rise in the number of victims willing to speak out, get support and help bring abusers to justice. 'In the year after Yewtree was launched there was an 81% increase in calls about sexual abuse to the NSPCC helpline and this surge continues. 'When children take the extremely difficult step of reporting abuse we need to ensure they are properly supported and get the help they need when they are brave enough to give evidence in court.' Operation Yewtree was sparked by revelations made in 2012 that the late comedian Jimmy Savile had sexually abused children and young women in the 1970s and 80s. The Scotland Yard investigation is understood to pursue three lines of inquiry. The first relates to Savile's crimes while the second to allegations made against him and other public figures. The third was set up to investigate reports made as a result of the high-profile Savile allegations.","Police have seen a surge in number of  child sex abuse cases since 2011 .

"An Australian teenager has told how she was raped twice on Christmas Eve in Bali while holidaying with her family - and has slammed Indonesian police for letting her attacker escape back to his native Nigeria. Audrey Pekin, 19, says she was attacked by a man, Henry Alafu, who she had met with other friends a few days earlier when he lured her to his remote home - and then assaulted her again in a taxi as she tried to flee. According to Channel 9's A Current Affair, the pair began drinking together at the Bounty Bar in Kuta, before moving to the nearby Sky Garden to continue the night. Scroll down for video . Audrey Pekin has detailed the alleged rape and attack she suffered while on a Christmas holiday to Bali with her family . Alafu lured Ms Pekin back to where his property away from the bustling tourist centre of the city, and brutally raped her on two separate occasions. Alafu told Ms Pekin a party was taking place a nearby villa, and the pair agreed to go to it together. According to ACA, during in taxi ride to the home, Ms Pekin began to feel unwell due to her type 1 diabetes. Once they arrived at the house, she was not put off by the lack of noticeable noise that suggested there was no party taking place, because her illness made it 'impossible to think', she told the show. Inside the house, Alafu locked the door and forced Ms Pekin to the bed where he allegedly attacked her. 'He went from a man to a monster,' Ms Pekin said. 'I can't quite describe the feeling, the sadness, to know what was about to happen and that I would or could not have done anything to stop it. 'I was literally shaking and drooling... I threw some very feeble punches, but I could not move my arms...I could not move anything.' After the first alleged attack, Ms Pekin said she desperately tried to escape. Alafu then followed her, and tormented her as she struggled to flee. She sought help from passing motorists and workers in a nearby service station, but Alafu allegedly told staff to ignore her and 'to stay out of it', the show reported. Ms Pekin believed she was safe when a cab picked her up, only for Alafu to force his way into the cab and again allegedly rape her. Henry Alafu is the man the Pekin family believed attacked their daughter . CCTV footage captured Alafu waiting in the lobby for Ms Pekin, as she stopped at the hotel before they continued with their night out. It was before the alleged attack took place . 'He kept trying to kiss me... he molested me in the back of the taxi for everyone, for the taxi driver, to see,' she claimed. 'He wouldn't stop.' Ms Pekin escaped the cab when it got back into the city of Kuta, when Alafu stalked after her again. 'He loped after me... he was laughing - he was taunting me,' she told ACA. It was only after another man, believed to be a fellow Australian, saw Ms Pekin was distressed and stepped in to help her. Ms Pekin said she tried to escaped from her alleged attacker by getting a cab back into the middle of Kuta, but he forced his way into the back of the car and  allegedly raped her a second time . 'I wish I could find that man... he deserves a medal, that man saved my life,' Ms Pekin said. Ms Pekin's sister, Frances, discovered her on the floor of her hotel room hours later. 'She wasn't even on the bed - she was next to the bed crying, shaking... in that moment I knew something, the worst had happened,' Frances Pekin said, according to the report. The family rushed Ms Pekin to hospital, where doctors found her entire body covered in bruises. 'He was crushing me, he nearly suffocated me... He could have killed me,' Ms Pekin said. 'It's so hard to get justice here,' Dawn Pekin (left) said. 'Men like him will cross path with many women. Don't think it can't happen to you' The 19-year-old then had a 'virginity test' at Sanglah Hospital, which she said was similar to a 'third assault'. 'The test was horrible, It was invasive... It was painful.' The test not only confirmed to police Ms Pekin had been raped, but it also revealed she had contracted a sexually transmitted infection in the attack. The Pekin family's torment was worsened by the fact the alleged predator was allowed to escape the country, and remains on-the-run. Alafu lured Ms Pekin back to where his property away from the bustling tourist centre of the city, and brutally raped her on two separate occasions,  according to ACA . A number of Facebook posts by Alafu, under a different name, including a picture he uploaded of the two together the night before, led to the Pekins family to believe it 'evident' he was the man who allegedly attacked their daughter. Police were in possession of Alafu's phone number, Facebook profile and current address, but the Pekin family says they did not do enough. 'It's just so hard to know what to do,' Ms Pekin's father, Karl, said. 'It's incredibly frustrating... They could have picked him up - he was still a threat. 'It's clear who he was, clear where he was, so we don't know why he wasn't picked up.' It was not until January 12, 18 days after the alleged attack, an attempt to arrest the Nigerian national. 'We're terrified. He's still free - we don't know if he is going to rock up on our doorstep,' Ms Pekin said . Four of Alafu's friends were arrested in a raid on the property on January 14, however it is believed he had escaped by that point. Police tracking revealed his phone was later used in Jakarta before being deactivated. His Facebook account was later opened from Nigeria. The Pekin family was paid more than $14,000 in legal fees over four days to proceed with the case. 'I think Bali is a lawless country,' Ms Pekin said. 'It has laws when it feels like it.' Police were in possession of Alafu's phone number, Facebook profile and current address . The family also called on the Australian government to help bring their daughter's attacker to justice. 'The Indonesian authorities have asked us why the AFP hasn't done anything, and it's a good question,' Mr Pekin said. The AFP said it did not have jurisdiction in the case, according to A Current Affair. According to the report, the Department of Foreign Affairs said it supplied comprehensive consular assistance to the family, but would not comment on an active investigation. 'It's incredibly frustrating... They could have picked him up - he was still a threat.'It's clear who he was, clear where he was, so we don't know why he wasn't picked up,' Mr Pekin said . The Pekin family said the country's lax policing of the problem means it is only a matter of time before another similar attack occurs. 'If you can rape a woman in Bali and just walk straight out of the country, that's not a deterrent, that's an invitation,' Dawn Pekin told the program. 'Either you get a cheap holiday, or you can have a safe one,' the 19-year-old Ms Pekin said. 'You can't have both.' Interpol was notified last week that Alafu is a wanted man. The Pekins are currently waiting for Interpol to issue a red notice for his arrest, which would allow the Australian government to push for Mr Alafu's arrest.

"Players' chief Gordon Taylor insists Raheem Sterling is not being disloyal to Liverpool by putting any further talks about a new contract on hold until the summer.

Sterling has insisted he is not a 'money grabber' and Taylor, chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association, believes waiting until the season is over before resuming talks could be a wise move.

Taylor said: 'I don't think it's meant to be a sign of disloyalty to Liverpool. 'Even Steven Gerrard, a Liverpool man all his career, had to think about his situation from time to time when there was a great deal of interest in him from other clubs. 'As a player with two years left on his contract he's obviously entitled to consider his options. 'It is a little bit untidy however when the negotiating is taking place in the full glare of the media. 'It's the nature of the game now and it is not necessarily a bad thing for both the club and the player to concentrate on football and leave things on the contract until the end of the season. Sterling has been linked with a move to Arsenal and leading clubs in Spain . Sterling scored for England in their Euro 2016 qualifier with Lithuania on Friday evening . 'They will want to focus on the run-in, the race for the top four and the Champions League places, and the FA Cup as well, and sometimes contract negotiations are the last thing you want to be worrying about.' Taylor added that he was confident Sterling was aware of what he owed to Liverpool and Rodgers.

"Living near congested roads with high levels of air pollution can cause ‘silent strokes’ which increase the risk of dementia, scientists have warned. Exposure to small, sooty particles, mostly caused by traffic fumes and factory emissions, alters the structure of the brain, they said. The microscopic particles have previously been shown to cause lung damage and harmful changes in blood vessels and clotting, and are thought to contribute to the deaths of 29,000 people every year in Britain. Living near a congested road can increase the chance of developing dementia, research has found . Researchers examined the brains of more than 900 people aged more than 60 and assessed the pollution risk . US researchers found evidence that living near congested roads or polluted areas can lead to ‘silent strokes’ which in turn cause shrinkage of the brain and other damage. Silent strokes, which arise from blockages in blood vessels supplying the brain, do not have any outward symptoms and the victim is usually unaware of them. Sudha Seshadri, a professor of neurology at Boston University School of Medicine, said: ‘This is concerning, since we know that silent strokes increase the risk of overt strokes and of developing dementia, walking problems and depression. ‘We now plan to look more at the impact of air pollution over a longer period, its effect on brain shrinkage over time, and other risks including stroke and dementia.’ The study, by Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Boston University School of Medicine, involved more than 900 people aged 60 and over who did not have dementia or a history of strokes. It recorded how far participants lived from major roads and used satellite imagery to assess their exposure to the fine particulate matter known as PM2.5. This is made up of small particles measuring just 2.5 micrometres, or 30 times smaller than the thickness of a human hair. These particles are generated from a variety of sources, including power plants, factories, trucks and cars and the burning of wood. They can travel deeply into the lungs and have been associated with increased numbers of hospital admissions for heart attacks and strokes. The study participants’ brain matter was measured using MRI scans. The researchers found that increases in PM2.5 in towns and cities was linked with a 46 per cent higher risk of silent strokes. The research was published in a report in the journal Stroke. Researcher Elissa Wilker, of the Cardiovascular Epidemiology Research Unit at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, said: ‘This is one of the first studies to look at the relationship between ambient air pollution and brain structure. ‘Our findings suggest that air pollution is associated with insidious effects, even in dementia and stroke-free individuals. ‘The mechanisms remain unclear, but inflammation resulting from the deposit of fine particles in the lungs is likely important.’ The study will add to mounting pressure on the Government, which faces a judgment at the Supreme Court next week over its failure to meet EU legal limits for air pollution. Sixteen cities – including London, Manchester, Glasgow, Sheffield and Birmingham – have failed to hit air quality targets.","American researchers examined more than 900 people aged 60 and over .

"A family-friendly coffee shop had its Facebook page hacked and flooded with pornography after an employee clicked on a malicious link in an email. Staff at Scooter's Coffee, in Omaha, were locked out of the page for almost 24 hours, starting at 5pm on Sunday, by an 'unknown third party' who then took control of the picture feed. Instead of the usual images of smoothies, coffees and cookies, the page was plastered with adult cartoons - similar to those posted on Delta Air Lines and Crayola's pages after they were hacked. Scooter's Coffee, Omaha, issued this apology to customers on its Facebook page after it was hijacked by hackers for 24 hours who used it to post pornography . Scooter's said that the images which appeared on their Facebook page were similar to the images that were posted on Crayola's page when they were hacked in January (pictured) From 5pm Sunday until almost the same time the next day, followers of the Scooter's Facebook page were sent links such as this one, instead of the regular images of smoothies and cookies . After trying to contact officials at Facebook with limited success, it was not until a day later that the company managed to kick the hacker out, and regain control of the account. Jamie Hamburg, spokesman for the company, said: 'At approximately 5pm CST on Sunday, 29 March, the Scooter's Coffee Facebook page was hacked by an unknown third party. 'The offensive content that has been posted as a result of this hack is similar to that seen in other recent breaches of major brands. 'Scooter's Coffee would like to apologize to our loyal Facebook audience and anyone that has been affected by this inappropriate content.' The hack is believed to have come after an employee clicked on a link of a direct message sent through Facebook itself. The hacker then kicked the member of staff out of the page, locked it, and began posting. Scooter's Coffee said that, despite repeated attempts to contact Facbook, and hundreds of reports being sent about inappropriate content, nobody at the social media network responded. It was only by contacting larger businesses that they were able to get in touch with Facebook, who removed the content and restored the page nearly 24 hours later. All of the images have now been removed, and Scooter's have offered apologies to thier customers via their Facebook and Twitter pages . It is thought that the hack occurred after an employee clicked on a link in an email which purported to be from Facebook. Hackers were then able to gather enough data to allow them to take control of the page . Crayon manufacturer Crayola was caught out by a similar breach in January, when hackers took control of the page to post pictures of cartoon breasts, and links to adult websites. One post included a link to a drawing of a scantily clad female cartoon character from the DreamWorks movie 'The Road to El Dorado' - with the words 'If Disney Was For Adults.' Delta Air Lines was also affected the following month in a similar attack involving a link to a sexually explicit joke. Their page was hijacked for around an hour, during which 'objectionable and offensive content', similar to that in the Crayola and Scooter's hacks, was published.",Staff were locked out of Scooter's Coffee page starting at 5pm on Sunday .

"The future of travel will be virtual. Never again will you need to board a plane to be able to take in the world's most breathtaking locales, at least if Facebook has anything to say about it. In a recent Q&A on the social media site, CEO and co-founder, Mark Zuckerberg, opened up about the future of travel and how virtual reality will play a key role. According to Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, the future of travel lies in sharing virtual reality environments . 'It will be pretty wild,' Zuckerberg replied to a follower online, according to arynews.tv. 'Just like we capture photos and videos today and then share them on the Internet to let others experience them too, we'll be able to capture whole 3D scenes and create new environments and then share those with people as well.' Zuckerberg's views of the future of virtual travel are perhaps unsurprising, considering that the social media giant purchased virtual reality headset maker, Oculus, last year. And at a conference in San Francisco last month, Facebook's chief technology officer, Mike Schroepfer, promised that virtual reality gaming would be coming 'this year.' Never again will you need to endure a long-haul flight to take in some of Thailand's best beaches . Thanks to the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset, users will be able to see the world from multiple viewpoints . Facebook also announced plans to begin supporting virtual reality on its newsfeed, meaning that users will be able to put on a VR headset and explore a location of their choosing. These videos are expected to be filmed with multiple cameras, so users will be able to change their viewpoints, allowing for even more in-depth exploration. Described as a 'first step,' it's also believed that even more immersive videos are on the horizon, including those which will use Oculus Rift, the virtual reality headset that straps over your eyes. 'VR is more than just another platform, it can create a whole range of human experiences,' said Michael Abrash, the Chief Scientist at Oculus.

"A 17 year-old college student could face a battle with Instagram after hacking the popular photo-sharing app. Caleb Benn, a Californian high school student, recently developed a $4.99 (£3.24) app for iOS devices using Instagram's application program interface. Called 'Uploader for Instagram', it allows users to upload photos to Instagram directly from their computer rather than using only their smartphone. Caleb Benn, a Californian high school student, has developed a $4.99 (£3.24) app for iOS devices using Instagram's application program interface (screen shot pictured). Now, the 17 year-old student could face a battle with Instagram over hackings its API . According Jillian Eugenios at CNNMoney, the teenager is currently making $1,000 (£675.70) a day from the app – and Instagram isn't happy. An engineer from Facebook, which owns Instagram, sent Benn an email last week claiming the app violated the company's terms of service. The email asked Benn to 'fix' the app by Monday, but Benn said doing this would make the app would be pointless. 'To be honest, I wasn't nonplussed when I got the email from Facebook,' Benn told DailyMail.com. 'I knew my app was playing in a legal gray area, and I suspected Facebook would find out about it somehow.' Facebook has strict restrictions against using its private API. An engineer from Instagram allegedly sent Benn an email last week, claiming the app violated the company's terms of service. Pictured on the right is a screenshot of the 'Uploader for Instagram' service . Chris Messina, a Silicon Valley technologist told CNNMoney the problem is that accessing the API 'opens up possibilities for all kinds of abuse, from spambots or people uploading stuff from other channels.' One in five Instagram users now combine their photos into a single image before uploading it to the app. To capitalise on this, the Californian firm has launched its latest standalone app called Layout that lets people create such collages with up to nine images and 11 combinations. Photos can be selected from the phone's camera roll, or taken with the Photo Booth tool, and Layouts can then be 'remixed' and edited with mirror effects and flips. The Layout app has four main features called Faces, Mirroring, Photo Booth and Previews. Users begin by selecting as many images, up to the maximum of nine, to feature in the collage. Photos can be selected or deselected at any point. As they add more images, the layout of the collage changes and photos can be dragged between sections and different sized boxes as desired. These photos can then be zoomed, flipped to form a mirror image, or turned upside down. He added, if Instagram wanted users to post from a computer, they can do so themselves. 'I was initially inspired to create the app because I saw a sincerely lacking feature for the desktop,' Benn said. 'I know Instagram purposely left out the uploading feature from the web interface to keep the social network’s unique, mobile-centered ecosystem intact. Instagram did release a web version of its software, called 'Your Instagram Feed on the Web' in February 2013. This allowed users to comment on each other's photos from a desktop, but the photo sharing site still does not allow uploaded of images from a PC. To combat the problem, some Instagram fans have installed special software, such as BlueStacks App Player, designed to simulate a mobile phone operating system on their computer. Uploader for Instagram offers a simpler workaround, and it is already garnering positive reviews on the App store. One user wrote: 'For my job, we post eight to ten Instagram pictures a week that are first designed on the computer. 'So it's always been a bit of a nuisance to transfer the image over to my phone then upload to Instagram. This app takes care of that.' Instagram, which Facebook acquired in 2012 for $1 billion, has 300 million monthly users. A spokesperson for Instagram declined to comment to DailyMail.com about the developments. Benn told DailyMail.com: 'I’ve played a few of my last cards, and now I’m just going to wait for Facebook to play theirs. 'I have no idea how this entire ordeal is going to end, but at least I know that I helped make a handful of people’s lives easier–and I think that that is worth all of the trouble.'

"A 16-year-old boy who was seized in an anti-terror operation after he tried to buy deadly poison on the internet has been spared jail after the court heard he wanted to commit suicide. The teenager from Mossley, Greater Manchester, who cannot be named for legal reasons, ordered the deadly toxin off the 'dark web'. He was unaware his online requests were being tracked by covert counter-terrorism officers who feared he was planning an attack. The teenager pleaded guilty to trying to buy the toxin at Manchester Youth Court earlier this month. A 16-year-old boy who was seized in an anti-terror operation after he tried to buy deadly poison on the internet has been spared jail after the court heard he wanted to commit suicide . But he claimed he was attempting to buy the deadly poison because he wanted to commit suicide and was sentenced to a 12 month referral order. Officers from the North West Counter Terrorism Unit started investigating the teenager in January when they received information that he was attempting to obtain the poison. Officers were in contact with the boy over the dark web - a subsection of deep web which is not indexed by standard search engines so users are less likely to be monitored. During their covert communication he expressed an interest in buying the poison and also showed an awareness of its toxicity and potential for use in causing harm. The teenager pleaded guilty to trying to buy the toxin at Manchester Youth Court (pictured) earlier this month . The 16-year-old  attempted to place an order on February 6 and also suggested he would make future purchases in larger quantities. Officers raided two homes in Tameside on February 16 and the 16-year-old boy was arrested. A 16-year-old girl was also arrested as part of the investigation but later released without charge. The dark web is a subsection of the deep web - the part of the internet that does not show up in searches or on social media. Most of the information on the web is far down on dynamically generated sites, unable to be found or seen by traditional search engines. The dark web is used as a way of sharing information and trading goods, but the anonymous and encrypted nature of it has attracted large amounts of illegal activity. The Silk Road website, and its successor that were recently shut down, was used to sell drugs in exchange for Bitcoins. Other dark net sites let users share pornographic photographs, hacked information and credit card numbers. Det Sgt Russell Stubbs said after the case: 'The teenager at the centre of this investigation is clearly a vulnerable, troubled young man and I hope now that this case is concluded he can get the help and support he needs to turn his life around. 'Thanks to the vigilance of officers from a number of different law enforcement agencies, we were able to intervene before this young man did get hold of such a deadly substance from a genuine seller. 'I want to reassure our communities that the North West Counter Terrorism Unit and local police are well aware of the potential dangers associated with internet activity on the 'dark web'. Law enforcement agencies use a range of investigative techniques to monitor and police unlawful internet activity. 'I would also urge parents of children to keep a very close eye on what their children are doing. Security measures are available to block certain sites and if you suspect your child is spending too much time on the Internet and you notice sudden changes in their behaviour then please report it. 'As in this case, the sooner we are able to identify someone either at risk or using the 'dark web' for criminal purposes the better chance we have to consider appropriate intervention options.' Last year, a graphic designer who fantasised about poisoning her mother after she forbade her from marrying the man became the first person to be prosecuted under the Biological Weapons Act. Kuntal Patel, from Stratford, east London, had wished her 'selfish and controlling' mother Meena Patel dead after the 61-year-old was 'hell-bent' on breaking up her engagement, a court was told. During the trial at Southwark Crown Court, the court heard the 37-year-old contacted a dealer in the U.S through the 'dark web' and said she needed a 'tasteless' and deadly toxin to get her mother 'out of the way'.

"(CNN)A mammoth wave of snow darkens the sky over Everest Base Camp. Appearing like a white mushroom cloud roaring over the climbers, they scurry as their tents flap like feathers in the wind. Then panic hits. ""Whoa! Whoa!"" Screams and expletives are heard. The few people in the video scatter and dive into a tent as the deluge of snow falls over them. Cursing and breathing heavily, they wait until the pounding is over. After a while, they scream to each other, ""Are you all right?"" ""Are you OK?"" The camera jostles back and forth as German climber Jost Kobusch heaves to catch his breath. Nearly 4,000 dead in Nepal earthquake . When they finally emerge from their avalanche ordeal, their faces are scarlet and their bodies crusted in snow. They trudge away, completely dazed and shocked. ""The ground was shaking from the earthquake and as soon as we saw people running, we were running ourselves to save our lives,"" Kobusch wrote in a post on his YouTube video. The harrowing two-minute clip shows the unimaginable scale of the avalanche that smashed into Everest Base Camp on Saturday. At least 17 people have been killed, with dozens injured and several missing -- likely buried beneath the snow and ice. The fates of the climbers and the local hires are one part of the enormous human toll in Nepal from the catastrophic quake that has so far claimed the lives of more than 4,300 people. At least 8,000 people were reported to have suffered injuries. Helicopters brought stranded climbers off the mountain Monday amid growing concern for the groups stuck around 20,000 feet (6,100 meters) high in Camps 1 and 2. The climbers who were higher up Everest appeared to have avoided the deadly avalanche that struck Base Camp, but many -- estimated to be in the hundreds -- could not descend on their own. The climbers can't head down because the dangerous Khumbu Icefall has been ravaged by a series of aftershocks. The aftershocks sent snow and rocks thundering down the mountainside, complicating rescue efforts. Tshering Sherpa, who manages the icefall route, estimated that 100 to 200 people were stuck in the higher camps after the avalanche. ""Bottom line, the icefall has been deemed impassable at this point,"" said Alan Arnette, a climber and Everest blogger who was at Camp 2 when the avalanche struck. He said that climbers at Camp 2 and others higher up would descend to Camp 1 (elevation 19,500 feet) to await helicopters. Arnette was helicoptered down to Base Camp on Monday. Witnesses said three helicopters rescued climbers and Sherpas from Camp 1, taking two people down at a time. Carsten Pedersen, a Danish climber at Base Camp, said that he heard a steady stream of helicopters ferrying people from the mountains back to Base Camp throughout the morning. ""They land every 10 minutes here,"" Pedersen said. ""I estimate half the people have been rescued, and it's probably less than 200 people in the mountain this morning. I wouldn't be surprised if 100 people came down already."" The window for helicopter rescue was expected to be between 9 a.m. and noon Monday. The helicopter rescues are heavily contingent on the weather. Jim Davidson, a climber on Everest, tweeted that the evacuations were going well. Down at Base Camp, Jamlins Sherpa said he counted about 22 body bags that were to be transported back to their families in Kathmandu. The death toll on Everest is still unclear. In an audio blog recorded from Camp 2, Arnette signed off with this message: ""It's important, it's not about mountaineering. This is about the earth and it's a horrible loss of life at Everest Base Camp and down at Kathmandu. ""It's a massive loss of life."" A member of Arnette's team, Eve Girawong, a medic from New Jersey who worked on the mountain, was killed at Base Camp, according to her family and employer. Several Everest climbing teams have confirmed deaths. Five Nepali staff members were killed at Everest Base Camp and Camp 1, according to Adventure Consultants. It did not identify the staffers. Three Sherpas from the 360 Expeditions team died, the company posted on its Facebook page. Their names were also not revealed. The foreign casualties at Everest Base Camp include Dan Fredinburg, an American executive at Google who died after suffering a major head injury, and Tom Taplin, a documentary filmmaker from California. ""He was blown away by the blast rather than being buried in any rubble,"" Taplin's wife, Corey Freyer, told CNN affiliate KABC. The exact number of dead remains unclear. CNN's Jessica King, Jethro Mullen, journalists Wayne Chang and Naomi Ng contributed to this report.","A YouTube video shows the scale of an avalanche on Mount Everest on Saturday .

"Turkey has blocked access to Twitter and YouTube after they refused a request to remove pictures of a prosecutor held during an armed siege last week. A Turkish court imposed the blocks because images of the deadly siege were being shared on social media and 'deeply upset' the wife and children of Mehmet Selim Kiraz, the hostage who was killed. The 46-year-old Turkish prosecutor died in hospital when members of the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front (DHKP-C) stormed a courthouse and took him hostage. The DHKP-C is considered a terrorist group by Turkey, the European Union and US. Scroll down for video . A Turkish court has blocked access to Twitter and YouTube after they refused a request to remove pictures of prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz held during an armed siege last week . Grief: The family of Mehmet Selim Kiraz grieve over his coffin during his funeral at Eyup Sultan Mosque in Istanbul, Turkey. He died in hospital after he was taken hostage by the far-left organisation . Two of his captors were killed when security forces took back the building where the far-left group was holding him. Gunshots were heard and smoke could be seen rising from the scene at the end of the six-hour stand-off. Mr Kiraz, a father-of-two married to a judge who also worked at the courthouse, was targeted for his part in an investigation into the death of Berkin Elvan. The 15-year-old was severely wounded after being hit on the head by a tear-gas canister fired by a police officer during anti-government protests in Istanbul in June 2013. After spending 269 days in a coma, Elvan eventually died on March 11 last year. His death, and the subsequent investigation, have since become a rallying point for the country's far-left. Gathering: Prosecutors, lawyers and judges stand near a statue of Lady Justice during the funeral ceremony . A British national, of Polish origin but who has not been named, was arrested on Saturday as part of an operation against the Revolutionary People's Liberation Party-Front, according to reports. A Foreign Office spokeswoman said this morning: 'I can confirm that a British national has been arrested in Turkey and that we are offering consular assistance.' Before imposing the blocks on the websites, Turkish authorities had tried to prevent newspapers printing images taken during the siege last week. The newspapers were accused by the government of 'spreading terrorist propaganda' in sharing the images of the hostage-taking. Presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said: 'This has to do with the publishing of the prosecutor's . picture. What happened in the aftermath (of the prosecutor's . killing) is as grim as the incident itself. 'The demand from the prosecutor's office is that this image . not be used anywhere in electronic platforms. 'The wife and children of prosecutor Kiraz have been deeply . upset. The images are everywhere.' He added: 'A request has been made to both Twitter and YouTube for the . removal of the images and posts but they have not accepted it . and no response has been given. 'That's why . this decision has been taken through a court in Istanbul.' Critical: Prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz was taken to hospital with gunshot wounds but died of his injuries .

"The girlfriend of a teenager with a life-threatening tumour has spoken of how his condition has left him paralysed and unable to dress himself. Jahnae Jackson has put her psychology studies on hold in order to care for her long-term boyfriend, Jackson Byrnes after he was diagnosed with a stage four brain tumour four weeks ago. The 18-year-olds from northern NSW have raised over $80,000 from community generosity for his life-saving surgery to be performed on Wednesday by renowned neurosurgeon Dr. Charlie Teo. 'He's already paralysed and I have to help him do many things, including dress him' Jahnae told Daily Mail Australia. Jackson's girlfriend Jahnae Jackson (right) noticed he had developed a lump three weeks ago and prompted him to visit a doctor who requested an MRI . For the past week Jackson and girlfriend have been desperately raising the sum needed to pay the hospital . Jahnae knew they needed a second opinion, so she hunted online for specialist who was willing . Three weeks ago Jackson was told by doctors that the tumour was too deep and aggressive to be safely operated on. Jahnae knew they needed a second opinion, so she hunted online for a specialist who was willing to perform Jackson's urgent surgery and that's when she found Dr. Charlie Teo from The Prince of Wales Hospital in Sydney. 'I had to be positive for Jackson as I knew there was always a way to help,' she said. On Monday morning they reached the target on their GoFundMe page, and although they still need an additional $45,000 to cover chemotherapy and other hospital fees, they are overwhelmed by the community support from the small town of Casino in northern NSW. 'It's absolutely unbelievable that a small town can do so much,' Jahnae said. 'It makes us feel so much better.' Although Jackson's surgery is likely to save his life, he still has a long road of rehabilitation in front of him as he will be left paralysed for some time. 'I was devastated when I found out, but I couldn't really react,' she said. The 18-year-old completed school at the end of last year and admits she wanted to go to university to study psychology or social work but has put it off due to Jackson's condition. 'I'd rather help my boyfriend out and worry about university later,' she said.

After desperately fundraising for a week and finally reaching his goal, Jackson said he has no nerves for the operation. 'I just want to get in there and get it over and done with,' Jackson told Daily Mail Australia. 'I'm just really thankful to the community as I didn't think we would raise this much money, it all happened so quickly.' Dr Teo, director of Sydney's Centre for Minimally Invasive Neurosurgery, said other surgeons were technically able to perform the surgery but he was the only one prepared to do it. 'People think that it's futile because he's got a malignant tumour and it's very aggressive,' Dr Teo told Daily Mail Australia. 'There's significant weakness down his left side and they think his quality of life is such that he wouldn't want to live anyway.' But Dr Teo said he makes decisions based on what his patients want. For the past week Jackson's family and friends have been desperately trying to raise $80,000 needed to pay the hospital upfront for the risky surgery . Jackson Byrnes was diagnosed with a stage four tumour three weeks ago and needed $80,000 for surgery . Jackson's mother Rhonda Byrnes said she was overwhelmed by the support and money raised by the community on his GoFundMe page, but said the family still needed more . 'If a patient really wants it and knows the risks and understands how risky the operation is I'll usually respect the patient's wishes,' he said . 'He is a lovely boy and he's only young. 'I said ""You know you're going to be paralysed"", I've told him the worst case scenario. 'He understands that and he wants to live.' Dr Teo will try to remove 95 per cent of the tumour, which has extended to very sensitive part of the brain. Dr Teo said the $80,000 payment required for the surgery was standard. Renowned neurosurgeon Dr Charlie Teo is the only surgeon in Australia willing to perform the risky operation that will likely see Jackson paralysed . Jahnae is currently in Sydney with Jackson and his family, preparing for his surgery on Wednesday . 'Most boys his age begin their journey into adulthood with hopes , dreams and anticipation of what lies ahead and excitement of the endless opportunities of what life will bring them,' Mr Byrne's fundraising page on GoFundMe reads. 'It is not a time to be enduring a fight for your life.' Victorian finance, leasing and risk management company Morris Finance have made the largest donation to the cause by pledging $2000.

"The Revered Al Sharpton appeared on Sunday in North Charleston and is expected to attend a vigil for Walter Scott, the black driver who was fatally shot by a white police officer after he fled a traffic stop. Rev. Sharpton preached at the Charity Missionary Baptist Church and addressed the Scott case and the need for reform around national policing legislation during his sermon. Elected officials and police from North Charleston were in attendance and South Carolina Senator Marlon Kimpson was also there to hear Sharpton speak. Scroll down for video . The Revered Al Sharpton delivered a sermon and addressed the Walter Scott situation on Sunday morning . North Charleston Mayor Keith Summey (left), Police Chief Eddie Driggers (center) and Sharpton 'discussed the Scott shooting' on Sunday before the reverend spoke at Charity Missionary Baptist Church in South Carolina . Sharpton wrote on Facebook: 'Joining us this morning is Mayor Keith Summey, Sheriff Al Cannon, Senator Marlon Kimpson, SCLC Leader Michael Steele, North Charleston Police [Chief] Eddie Driggers, and Assistant Police Chief Reggie Burgess.' The officers and elected officials listened 'intently' to what Sharpton had to say as he gave credit to Mayor Summey for firing Michael Slager, the officer who killed Scott, according to the Post and Courier. During the sermon, Sharpton said: 'When he's wrong ... we protest. 'When he's right, we should have the same courage to say he's right. 'Let us use this hour to not only change what's going on in North Charleston. 'North Charleston, that's known as a place of intolerance, can be the place that could set a new tone in policing all over the United States. 'Maybe now between a southern white mayor and a forgiving black mother, maybe this nation will deal with this.' The civil rights leader is also expected to attend a vigil near the scene of the Scott shooting on Sunday afternoon. Sharpton denied Scott's family barred him from attending his funeral on Saturday because it would cause a 'circus' of media attention. Allegations that Scott's family wanted nothing to do with Sharpton were published by the New York Daily News. In response, Sharpton said: 'There has never been a discussion about me attending or participating in the funeral on Saturday, since everyone knows that [National Action Network's] convention with thousands of delegates is happening in New York and doesn't end until Saturday night.'

Hundreds of mourners attended the funeral for Scott, 50, on Saturday in Summerville, north of North Charleston where the shooting took place. Sharpton remained in New York where his National Action Network was wrapping up its national convention. Slager, 33, the North Charleston officer who fired eight times at Scott's back as he fled from a traffic stop, has been charged with murder and dismissed from the police force. Slager pulled Scott's black Mercedes-Benz over for a broken tail light. Video from the dashboard camera in Slager's police cruiser recorded a respectful exchange between the two men before the officer returned to his patrol car. A few minutes later, after being told by Slager to stay in the Mercedes, the man emerged from his car and ran off. Scott, who was apparently unarmed, had a history of arrests for failing to pay child support. A cellphone video taken by a bystander showed the men in a brief tussle before Scott ran off again, Slager fired his gun and Scott slumped into the grass. There was a gap between the two videos, however, as the officer was not wearing a body camera. Scott's shooting was one of the latest in a series of killings that have stoked a national outcry over police use of force against African Americans. Last year, the fatal shooting of an unarmed black man in Ferguson, Missouri, and choking death of a black man in New York City triggered a wave of demonstrations across the country.",Reverend Sharpton was expected to appear Sunday in North Charleston .

"West Brom manager Tony Pulis will receive a hero's welcome when he returns to Crystal Palace on Saturday but in the midst of yet another relegation battle for the 57-year-old, he must wonder if he'll ever be successful at the right end of the Premier League. For all the expertise Pulis has in keeping clubs in the top flight, a talent that has the everlasting gratitude of Stoke City and Palace supporters, his overall record is one of the worst of any long-serving Premier League manager. This is his seventh season in the top flight and he's never finished in the top half of the table. If, as expected, Garry Monk's Swansea City don't drop lower than 10th, Pulis will be the only manager in the Premier League with more than 12 months experience who has never finished higher than 11th. Tony Pulis has never managed to guide a team into the top half of the Premier League . To add to his frustration as he takes the applause of the Palace fans who remember him for masterminding their great escape last season, Pulis will know he isn't yet guaranteed preserving his proud record of never being relegated. West Brom's home defeats against QPR and Leicester City have left them stuck on 33 points. That is still seven points above the bottom three but with four of their final five fixtures after the weekend coming against Liverpool, Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal, there is not much wriggle-room. For many, producing statistics to suggest Pulis could have produced better results is heresy. He won promotion with Stoke City and got them to an FA Cup final. He turned Palace's season around 12 months ago and is still favoured to keep Albion up this time. Pulis did an excellent job in turning around Palace's fortunes last season . Palace fans were pleased with the job Pulis did in his time at Selhurst Park . He is known as a good organiser, a smart tactician and someone who is able to get the best out of players and bend the laws of the game to his advantage. And yet, why has he never finished higher than 11th, achieved in 2009/10 with Stoke and 20013/14 with Palace? It is right to say he has never had the best clubs with the most money to manage and yet Sam Allardyce finished sixth with Bolton, Mark Hughes sixth with Blackburn Rovers, Mauricio Pochettino eighth with Southampton and Monk is currently eighth with Swansea City. None of them giants of the game. Pulis took Stoke into the Premier League and turned them into an established team . Pardew, who has achieved a similar miracle at Palace this season to what Pulis achieved last season, has a top-five finish at Newcastle United on his cv. Two years ago, Stoke City effectively sacked Pulis, acknowledging the huge contribution he made to the club but feeling he couldn't take them any further. Hughes now has the club sitting in 10th place, higher than Pulis achieved, and on a smaller wages budget.

The Welshman won't be able to enjoy his visit to Palace given the importance of the game. 'We need a 90 minutes from the players.

"Tony Pulis believes Joey Barton 'probably had a point' when claiming West Bromwich Albion's players 's*** themselves' during defeat to Queens Park Rangers earlier this season. In December West Brom were two goals up but lost to a Charlie Austin hat-trick, leading to Barton's scathing judgement and plunging Alan Irvine to the brink of the sack. Barton said then: 'West Brom went 2-0 up and I turned to Dunney (Richard Dunne) and said, 'they've scored too early.' They don't know how to get over the finishing line.'

The teams meet again at the Hawthorns on Saturday with Pulis having instilled a solid core to the point Albion have not conceded after scoring first in a game. 'Whatever Joey says or whatever he does he's entitled to hid views and his opinions,' Pulis said. 'The club were 2-0 up and lost 3-2 so he most probably had a point, or he felt he had a point to say something on that subject.' Pulis recalled his own misfortune from leading 2-0 and losing as Gillingham manager in the Second Division play-off final of 1999. 'I've managed teams that have been 2-0 up with only for or five minutes to go and ended up drawing then losing on penalties. 1999 Man City Wembley,' he added. 'So I can't talk about being indestructible in respect to leads. 'We've played really well I don't think they've just been good results. The performances have been really, really good.

"Ed Miliband (pictured yesterday at the Shree Swaminarayan Temple, north London) is pressing on with his controversial cap rents, despite warnings from experts that plans will backfire . Labour's plans to impose rent controls are ‘economically illiterate’ and will slash investment in new housing, leading to more tenants being evicted by their landlords, experts warned last night. Ed Miliband yesterday confirmed he would press on with controversial plans to cap rents despite warnings from housing experts, business and even Labour figures that they will backfire. He said rent controls – demanded by the militant Unite union that bankrolls Labour – would give millions of ‘forgotten’ renters a fairer deal by helping those stuck in so-called Generation Rent by soaring house prices. But the Generation Rent campaign group said his plans were ‘riddled with loopholes’ and may make tenants’ lives worse. Under the proposals, landlords would have to offer three-year tenancies and would be banned from raising rent above inflation during this time. Alex Hilton, director of Generation Rent, said long tenancies were welcome but the proposal would give landlords an incentive to evict their tenants and would not keep rent down, adding: ‘This is because they have no plans to limit rent rises between tenancies – or after your first three years are up. ‘Worse than this, Labour’s planning new ways for landlords to evict you within that period, for example to sell your home or get it back for other reasons. These loopholes are scary when you think they’re attached to a big financial incentive to use them – because that’s the only way they will be able to put rent up in the first three years.’ In another loophole, hundreds of thousands of properties owned by buy-to-let investors could be excluded altogether. Most buy-to-let mortgages specify maximum tenancies of one year. Labour sources said these landlords would be able to offer short tenancies ‘where contractually obliged’. Senior Tories called the proposal ‘drivel’ and said it would suppress house building and push rents up. Chancellor George Osborne described the plan as a ‘totally economically-illiterate statement that grabs headlines, but is dismissed by every expert who looks at it’. The Confederation of British Industry said the way to tackle the housing crisis was to build more homes, and warned the plans could discourage investment, thereby forcing up rents in the long term. The Labour leader said rent controls – demanded by the militant Unite union that bankrolls Labour – would give millions of ‘forgotten’ renters a fairer deal by helping those stuck in so-called Generation Rent . Senior Tories called the proposal ‘drivel’ and said it would suppress house building and push rents up. Pictured: Mr Miliband and Boris Johnson on the Andrew Marr show today . Some senior Labour figures also have concerns, with former minister Tessa Jowell warning against a cap last week, saying: ‘Before taking a step like that you have to be clear it doesn’t have unintended consequences.’ Yesterday, however, she insisted she supported the plan. Housing spokesman Emma Reynolds was forced on the back foot yesterday after footage emerged of her in 2013 saying: ‘I don’t think rent controls are going to work in practice.’ Yesterday, she said she meant ‘Seventies-style controls’ and said Labour’s plan was different. Rent controls were widely blamed for a reduction in rented housing in Britain and Europe in the Seventies as investment dried up. The bad old days: A Manchester slum . Rent controls have already proved a disaster in Britain after they were introduced in the First World War. The measure was supposed to be temporary – but was only dismantled by Margaret Thatcher in the Eighties. During this time the private rented sector collapsed from 90 per cent of the country’s housing stock to less than 10 per cent. By the Seventies, rent controls were widely blamed for the slum conditions in much of Britain’s remaining private rented stock. Landlords, unable to make a sustainable return, neglected homes and dragged their feet over the most basic repairs. Unscrupulous operators such as Peter Rachman, whose name became a byword for exploitation, drove out tenants who had legal rent protection to replace them with others who were not covered by the law. Gordon Brown’s favourite economist Paul Krugman, a Nobel prize-winner, has warned that attempts to control rent always fail, writing: ‘Almost every freshman-level textbook contains a case study on rent control, using its known adverse side-effects to illustrate the principles of supply and demand.’ The socialist Swedish economist Assar Lindbeck once said: ‘Next to bombing, rent control seems in many cases to be the most efficient technique for destroying cities.’ Alan Ward, of the Residential Landlords Association, warned that rent controls could result in a return to the ugly conditions of the past, adding they ‘would lessen investment in new homes when we need more and serve only to paper over cracks in the market’. He said: ‘For some, it is easier to achieve a cheap political point by calling for rent controls than provide a prescription for growth in the private rented sector. Ultimately, tenants would lose as they find themselves forced into slums rented by Rachman landlords operating outside the legal market.’ David Cox, of the Association of Residential Letting Agents, said rent controls led to a fall in supply and the standard of homes because ‘landlords do not have the money to invest in ongoing maintenance’. Sam Bowman, of the Adam Smith Institute think-tank, said rent controls were ‘a stunningly bad idea that could clobber renters’. He said they would give landlords a huge incentive to raise rents at the start of a tenancy, adding: ‘Labour has unwittingly announced a policy that could devastate cities and exacerbate the housing crisis.’ The Institute of Economic Affairs said the proposal ‘would result in higher rents, a reduction in the quality of rented property and in the supply of homes to rent without improving affordability’.

"Police have dropped an investigation into a vicious assault on a huntsman just three months after it took place – despite a wealth of evidence pointing to the identity of a suspected attacker. Last night the victim, Mike Lane, 40, who was beaten by balaclava-clad protesters armed with iron bars on ropes, condemned the decision by police as ‘pathetic’. He said: ‘They could have made more effort. Everyone is very disappointed. I’ve been told that unless further evidence comes forward, the attackers are not likely to be found. We find it pathetic.’ Attack: Mike Lane,40, who is joint master of the Tedworth Hunt,  on the ground during the confrontation with hunt saboteurs . A video of the incident and a dossier of evidence, including some names of saboteurs and their car registration numbers, was given to Wiltshire Police after the assault. The attack at Everleigh, near Amesbury, took place even though the 30 riders and their hounds were chasing only an artificial scent, rather than a fox. During the incident, Mr Lane, who is joint master of the Tedworth Hunt, was sent flying to the ground, before being kicked in the head. He was admitted to hospital with concussion and broken teeth and his face was swollen. Since the attack he has suffered memory loss. The face of the thug who kicked Mr Lane was captured on video. Following the attack, Wiltshire Police issued the suspect’s photograph, although he has not been identified. In an exclusive interview with The Mail on Sunday, Mr Lane said: ‘I’ve been told by police they are shelving their inquiries due to insufficient evidence. It’s angered us because we gave them evidence. I’m beginning to lose my trust in the police.’ Wiltshire Police confirmed they had stopped the investigation pending further information, but their failure to identify, charge or prosecute anyone involved has dismayed hunt supporters across the country. This is the face of the main suspect . On the day of the attack, January 24, about 15 protesters sprayed hounds with the perfumed chemical citronella to distract them from the scent. Mr Lane said: ‘I noticed they parked about 250 yards away. Then five came towards us. They were looking for trouble – it was a hardcore element we’d not seen before. ‘They were abusive and then one spat at me and then punched me in the face. A scuffle broke out and I slipped and one started kicking me in the head, stamped on me and the heel of his steel toe-capped trainer stuck in my mouth. I was knocked out for a few minutes. Then the chap started swinging a rope with an iron bar.’ Mr Lane, who has paid £500 for dental treatment since the attack, added: ‘I feel let down and think the police could have done more.’ Karen Fieldsend, 42, who made the call to police, is furious that the case has been dropped. ‘It’s disgraceful,’ she said. ‘If you had people assaulted in a city centre, something would be done, but in the countryside people forget about it.’ James Cameron, 53, vice-chairman of the Tedworth Hunt, added: ‘Their decision is disappointing, but this highlights how difficult it is for police to do their job when saboteurs turn up wearing face coverings.’ The Countryside Alliance is campaigning to ban saboteurs from wearing a face covering so criminals can be brought to justice. Last night a spokesman for Wiltshire Police said: ‘We have been unable to move the inquiry further forward. At this stage the case has been recorded as undetected, however should other evidence come to light then it will be re-opened.’",Mike Lane was beaten by masked protesters armed with iron bars on ropes .

"Juventus have ruled out a move for Manchester United loan star Radamel Falcao after claiming the Colombia striker's wages are 'beyond their means'. Falcao has endured a difficult period at Old Trafford after arriving in an expensive loan deal from Monaco last summer. The 29-year-old is unlikely to remain at the club after scoring only four goals and failing to force his way into Louis van Gaal's starting XI. Juventus general manager Beppe Marotta has claimed that Falcao wanted to come to Turin last summer but the Serie A champions have now taken themselves out of the race to sign him. Radamel Falcao (right) has scored only four goals since arriving at Manchester United from Monaco . The Colombian is expected to leave in the summer, although Juventus claim they cannot afford him . 'Falcao is a Monaco player on loan at Manchester United and his wages are substantial and beyond our means,' Marotta told La Gazzetta dello Sport. 'It's utopian to imagine him in a Juventus shirt.' However, Marotta did claim the Italians, who reached the Champions League semi-finals at the expense of Monaco on Wednesday, were interested in strike pair Paulo Dybala and Edinson Cavani. With former Manchester City striker Carlos Tevez set to return to Boca Juniors at the end of the season, Juventus need to reinforce their forward line with Palermo's Dybala and Edinson of Paris Saint Germain at the top of their wishlist. The Serie A champions have expressed an interest in highly rated Palermo youngster Paulo Dybala . With Dybala rated at £35m, PSG's unsettled striker Edinson Cavani could be a cheaper alternative . 'We do like Dybala and he is one of our objectives,' Marotta said. 'I won't hide the fact that I have met with [Palermo president Maurizio] Zamparini -- even if I do go and deny it, he will only blurt it out anyway. 'He's a great player, but alongside him you need experienced players too. We're trying to find an agreement with Zamparini for this player who we like, but we're not the only ones who like him. Let's just see what happens.' Juventus players celebrate after beating Monaco to reach the Champions League semi-finals . The 21-year-old, who has scored 13 goals this term, is rated at £35million by his club - a fee that the Old Lady would not be prepared to meet, leading Marotta to also express his interest in Uruguay forward Cavani. 'We've not had any contact with Paris Saint-Germain for Cavani, but if he were to be placed on the market, then we would have a little chat,' Marotta said.",Monaco loanee Radamel Falcao is not expected to stay at Man Utd .

"The father of the little girl who starred in a photograph that sent the internet into a frenzy because of a mystery pair of boots has 'no idea' what the object could be. Martin Springall, 38, photographed his young daughter - who he wished not be named - standing near a rocky outcrop in Zushi, Japan, in July 2014. He said he was living and working in Tokyo, around an hour north, and wanted to send a picture 'to my wife, who was at work'. 'I took a series of them,' Mr Springall said via email. 'It wasn't until I was checking them later in the evening that I just happened to notice the boots behind her in that one shot.' 'I showed my wife immediately. She was considerably more upset by it than I was, to be honest. Martin Springall (pictured with his daughter, who he wished not to be named) said he had 'no idea' what the item could be . A trick of the light or paranormal forces at play? There is chatter online about what the cause of this apparent black boot apparition is . Eerie: A pair of black boots are clearly seen behind the little girl - even though her photographer father apparently does not recall a person standing there . The Reddit user who posted the controversial image online suggested they could be samurai boots - although others are not so sure . Mr Springall gave permission for his friend, Brian, to post the image to Reddit - where it became a topic of 'mostly negative' discussion - until it resurfaced this week . 'I just kind of obsessed over that one photo for a couple of hours that evening and then tried to forget about it. 'I really don't like dwelling on stuff like this, to be honest - it freaks me out.' The photograph has sparked considerable debate on the website Reddit, with sceptics arguing whether the picture was modified, if there was a person standing behind the girl or if it was all a trick of the light. Mr Springall insisted there was 'no one' else in the vicinity - and said it had not been Photoshopped, despite sceptics believing otherwise. 'I certainly would have noticed someone standing behind her in one of the shots,' he said. 'She likely wouldn't even have posed for the picture in that case, because she's incredibly shy'. In this picture from the same set, no one appears to be standing behind this little girl . However, in this other supplied picture, the black boots have returned . 'I have no idea what the boots are, where they come from or what they could represent. 'All I can tell you is that I totally get the cynicism.... If I saw that online I would view it exactly the same way. 'I can assure you, though, that it was just the two of us in the area and the photo is 100% untouched. He said he showed his friend Brian Publicover, 38, the picture on a camping trip around a month later. Mr Publicover, a Canadian, then posted it to Reddit under the username Obiaruf. 'We're not saying it's a ghost,' said Mr Publicover, who is working in Japan, where his friend was also living until a few months ago. Friends: Brian (left) posted the picture to Reddit, where it took off. Both Martin and Brian . Sceptics have noted the presence of a blue piece of fabric lingering behind the little girl . He added that he had just been 'speculating' previously when he said on Reddit that the boots appeared to be 'samurai boots'. He said there were more convincing posts on Reddit that argued it was actually the image of an American World War II era uniform. Particularly given a flash of blue fabric that appeared above her left arm. 'I hope someone can put this through some sort of image-analysis software,' he said. 'We aren't trying to pull some sort of scam here. We're just saying ""we can't explain this, and it's a bit unsettling"".'

For Korea's SsangYong is launching a new sports utility vehicle from under £13,000 that promises value for money motoring for drivers who believe in watching their pennies. But SsangYong (Korean for 'two dragons') has given its new sporty five-door family runaround a very European name - Tivoli - after the stylish Italian town near Rome, home to the Villa d'Este, a Unesco world heritage site famed for its Renaissance architecture and garden. SsangYong (Korean for 'two dragons') is launching a value for money sports utility vehicle . Pitched to take on the pumpedup Nissan Juke, the Tivoli SUV is powered by 1.6 litre Euro 6 petrol and diesel engines with six speed manual and automatic transmissions. It arrives in the UK this summer in three trim levels - SE, EX, ELX - with a choice of front-wheel drive or 'intelligent' 4x4 and seven airbags across the range. There's also a five-year unlimited mileage warranty. The entry level SE, from £12,950, is finished in grey cloth trim and includes 16-in alloys, cruise control, a petrol stop/go system, seven airbags and 'smart' steering with normal, comfort and sport modes. The top-of-the-range ELX, from £16,000 to £19,000, comes fully loaded with a choice of the full range of engines and gearboxes plus diamond cut alloy wheels, smart keyless starting, front and rear parking sensors, privacy glass, rear spoiler, automatic headlamps, rain sensing wipers, TomTom navigation system with 7 in touch screen and a rear-view camera. There is a choice of six exterior colours, and even a 'My Tivoli' personalisation programme which allows customers to create their own distinctive car. This includes the styling pack (£400) which gives a choice of five two-tone roof combinations, plus further engine and drivetrain options. As well as offering lots of interior seating and storage space, it aims to offer driver and passengers easy connectivity to their IT devices. SssangYong's UK sales and marketing director Steve Gray expects it to double the firm's annual UK sales from 2,000 to 4,000 a year.

Motorists of a certain age may recall those fondly remembered TV adverts from childhood for rufty-tufty Tonka Toys. These were virtually indestructible metal cars - usually 4x4s or trucks with massive wheels. The TV advert informed viewers: 'They build real tough toys, for real tough boys - Tonka!' Well, Citroen seems to have taken its inspiration from them for its Aircross model (above). It even has protective alloy bumps front and side made from honeycomb aluminium castings surrounded by hard rubber. Billed as a big brother to the current Citroen C4 Cactus, it was shown in prototype hybrid form at the Shanghai Motor Show in China. Citroen's global boss, Briton Linda Jackson, says her company has to regain the sort of design flair that created the 2CV: 'If we want stand-out cars, then we have to be bold.' The prototype has a 1.6 litre petrol engine linked to an electric motor combining to create 313bhp. Citroen claims a special boost function will help it accelerate from rest to 62mph in 4.5 seconds.

"Lorenzo Simon was today found guilty of murder after killing his tenant then hacking his body into pieces . A landlord who chopped his friend up and stuffed the body parts into suitcases which he dumped in a canal was today found guilty of murder. Lorenzo Simon, 34, forced victim Michael Spalding, 39, to decorate his flat before attacking him when he refused to work any longer. He then dismembered the handyman using a hacksaw and put Mr Spalding's body parts and tools into two suitcases. Simon, with the help of his girlfriend Michelle Bird, 35, then threw the suitcases into a canal which they weighed down using broken concrete slabs. Today he was found guilty of murder after a jury took 15 hours to decide by unanimous verdict at Birmingham Crown Court. Bird was cleared of murder and manslaughter but admitted assisting an offender following the four-week trial. The court heard Simon murdered Mr Spalding, known as Spud, by stabbing him in the neck at the flat they shared in Smethwick, Birmingham, on April 26 last year. He then hacked the body up and stuffed the head, limbs and tools into a suitcase. Police found his remains when a narrow boat owner spotted one suitcase, containing Mr Spalding's torso, floating in the Birmingham Canal on May 5. It was examined by a Canal Trust contractor on May 12, who opened the case to discover the gruesome evidence. Police divers recovered the second case which contained Mr Spalding's head, limbs and tools - below Pope Bridge, Smethwick, on May 16. Further searches of the canal bed uncovered a hacksaw which was used to saw off Mr Spalding's head. Using futuristic 3D scanning technology experts were able to show a perfect jigsaw fit between the charred bone and a severed limb found in the suitcase. The same technique - which provides image resolution 43,000 times more detailed that a hospital CT scan - proved a link between the hacksaw and lacerations found on other bones. Mr Spalding's body parts were found inside this suitcase, which was dumped in the Birmingham Canal . A second suitcase (pictured) containing Mr Spalding's grisly remains was discovered 11 days later . Drag marks were also found on the towpath near Pope's Bridge where Simon and Bird dumped the suitcases into the canal. Unemployed Simon, who has convictions for robbery, burglary, theft and supplying drugs, moved to Derby in a bid to evade police but was arrested with Bird on May 19. He denied knowledge of Mr Spalding's death, claiming he threw him out following a row over a car crash, but later admitted assaulting him during a fight. Neighbours reported seeing a bonfire in the garden and when officers raided the home they discovered part of a humerus bone inside the drum. Detectives later heard accounts from neighbours who told of 'aggressive, nasty' arguments coming from the flat. One recalled Simon saying: 'I want this place finished, I've got to live here, you are taking the p**s'. 3D scanning technology was able to prove a link between this hacksaw and lacerations found on Mr Spalding's bones . Mr Spalding was heard to reply: 'I'm tired, I'm hungry, I want to go home. I've been at it all day'. Adjourning the case until next Wednesday for sentencing, Justice Kathryn Thirlwall said: 'Lorenzo Simon you have been convicted of murder. As you know the sentence for murder is life imprisonment. 'The question is the minimum amount of time you should serve before the consideration of parole.' Speaking after the verdict, Detective Inspector Harry Harrison, of West Midlands Police, said: 'Michael was exploited in life by Lorenzo Simon and Michelle Bird and they afforded him no dignity in death. When police raided the home, parts of a humerus bone were discovered inside this charred drum . 'On the contrary, they treated him in the most despicable manner in order to conceal their crime. 'Simon accepted Michael as a tenant on the agreement he used his considerable handyman skills to do up the flat. 'But he treated him like a slave, working him past midnight and then waking him early in the morning to continue working. 'They were only allowed out with his say-so and given just one meal a day, usually pizza and chips. 'Michael finally broke and complained at their treatment. We believe that, combined with a car accident where Simon accused him of being responsible for damaging his VW Passat, led to the fatal attack. 'Simon said he hit Michael in the back and that he fell to the floor dead within seconds and claimed to have disposed of the body in panic. 'Bird said she was on an errand to buy alcohol at the time of the killing but later admitted helping her boyfriend in the aftermath. 'However, we were able to provide compelling evidence to the jury that this was a vicious murder and that Simon went to considerable lengths to try and cover his tracks.'","Lorenzo Simon, 34, forced tenant Michael Spalding to decorate his flat .

"Ten people, including four children, have been involved in a multi-vehicle crash in Brisbane's west. Three vehicles collided on the Brisbane Valley Highway, 2km south of Fernvale, on Wednesday afternoon. A 40-year-old man with chest and shoulder injuries and a five-year-old boy with chest pain were the first patients flown out by rescue helicopter. They've been taken to the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Brisbane. Shortly after, a 27-year-old woman with arm injuries and a six-year-old girl suffering from abdominal pain were also being flown out. The three car pileup happened at on the Brisbane Valley Highway, near Fernvale . Six others - including an infant and two young girls - have been taken to Ipswich Hospital with minor injuries or for further assessment. A man has also suffered hand lacerations and two females escaped injuries. The affected stretch of the highway has been closed off, with diversions in place south of Fernvale. The Courier-Mail reports that earlier emergency crews found one person trapped inside their vehicle and Queensland Fire and Rescue crews used hydraulic cutting gear to free them. The Rescue 500 helicopter then landed at the scene and airlifted a number of patients to hospital. Police said the highway would be closed for a few hours with diversions in place south of Fernvale.","Three vehicles collided on the Brisbane Valley Highway, near Fernvale .

"Researchers have discovered that the brain can remember 'neutral' or boring events more easily when they are tied to an emotion . From what we eat to what we see, we constantly take in details about our environment. And while there is no need to remember many of them, our brain has the remarkable ability to store information that seems inconsequential at the time in case it becomes useful later on. Given new and relevant information, human beings have the capacity to strengthen weak memories using emotions - and researchers have said this points to the adaptive nature of human memory. Psychologists at New York University have been trying to gain an understanding about how the brain stores memories for 'emotionally neutral events' that gain significance through subsequent experience. 'How does the brain store all of this information? And how does emotion strengthen mundane memories?' post-doctoral fellows Joseph Dunsmoor and Vishnu Murty wrote on The Conversation. This study largely focused on how our brains remember emotionally arousing stimuli, such as evocative imagery or traumatic events . In particular, the study has looked into how the September 11 terrorist attacks in the the US affect memory retention. The researchers said we take for granted that we remember highly emotional events better than we remember neutral events, like a lunch date. Emotion increases our ability to remember by affecting activity in brain regions involved in emotional processing - particularly the amygdala and striatum - and also the regions involved in encoding new experiences, like the hippocampus. Scroll down for video . Emotion also increases the strength of our memory over time - a process called consolidation. Strong emotion can strengthen memory for positive events, such as a surprise birthday party thrown by close friends, and for negative events, such as making an embarrassing faux pas at the office holiday party. Researchers said we take for granted that we remember highly emotional events, like 9/11, better than we remember neutral events, like a lunch date. This is because emotion affects activity in certain brain regions. A view over the Hudson River towards the September 11th memorial lights is shown . A power nap of just 45 minutes can boost memory by five times, research has found. A short doze helps you to retain information you have learned and 'significantly' improves recall, scientists said – meaning naps really could help students revising for exams. Participants in the study learned 90 single words and 120 unconnected word pairs such as 'milk taxi'. Some then watched a DVD while others slept. When they were then retested, those who had slept remembered more word pairs, the journal Neurobiology of Learning and Memory reported last month. Scientists from Saarland University in Germany, said that during sleep, bursts of brain activity known as sleep spindles play an important role in consolidating newly learned information. Professor Axel Mecklinger said a nap of just 45 minutes to an hour 'produces a five-fold improvement in information retrieval from memory'. 'The memory performance of the participants who had a power nap was just as good as it was before sleeping, that is, immediately after completing the learning phase.' While many details are not intrinsically emotionally arousing, they can gain emotional significance through our experiences. For example, the memory of a surprise birthday party includes details like what people were wearing and who was there. On the face of it, these details are not emotionally significant but we remember them because of the context in which they were experienced. Dr Dunsmoor and Dr Murty’s research has shown that people have better memory for boring information when it’s presented in an emotional context, regardless of if it is rewarding or negative. ‘In some of our earlier studies, we found that people selectively remember neutral pictures if the pictures had been associated with an electrical shock the previous day, even when the volunteers were unaware that we would later test their memory, they wrote. ‘We have also shown that people remember neutral pictures if they are warned that if they forget them, they will receive a shock the next day. ‘Likewise, being rewarded with money for remembering certain pictures the next day can boost memory for those pictures as well.’ These experiments focus on emotional factors at the time the original memory is created and the findings show how seemingly trivial information associated with a meaningful event can be selectively preserved in memory. Emotion also increases the strength of our memory over time - a process called consolidation. Strong emotion can strengthen memory for positive events, such as a surprise birthday party (stock image), and for negative events, such as making an embarrassing faux pas at an office party . Emotion affects activity in brain regions involved in emotional processing - such as the amygdala (pictured) and regions involved in encoding new experiences, like the hippocampus (also marked) But what happens when the emotional event happens after the original memories were formed? ‘In a recent study, we found that an emotional experience can enhance memory for neutral information encountered previously,’ the researchers continued. Volunteers viewed a series of trivial pictures from two categories, either animals or tools. After a delay, volunteers were presented with a new set of animal and tool pictures – only this time, when the volunteer saw the pictures they received an electrical shock to the wrist. ‘We already knew that memory would be strengthened for the pictures paired with the electrical shock. But here we found that if we paired shocks with pictures of animals, memory was strengthened for pictures of animals volunteers saw before any shocks were delivered. ‘If we shocked volunteers when they where shown pictures of tools, memory for the earlier pictures of tools was strengthened.’ The negative experience selectively increased memory for related information that was completely trivial when it was originally experienced. We use our memory not only to remember the past, but to guide our decisions in the future. Emotion helps us remember relevant information to determine our choices, but without the ability to strengthen seemingly trivial past experiences with new important information, we might end up missing out on future rewards or repeating the same mistakes.",New York University psychologists studied how the brain stores memories . Found boring details become more memorable with emotional context . Emotional experience can enhance memory for old neutral information .,5fe2a1c4777fe26681ddb9745d54f15aa9da51b0
"Hull bounced back from Thursday's derby defeat to Hull KR to snatch a surprise 28-20 victory at Langtree Park, condemning St Helens to a third straight defeat. A long-distance Jamie Shaul try was enough to seal a win that shocked the home side, who appeared to be hanging on after their Good Friday exertions. The injury-hit champions - who were in the wars again last week, losing to rivals Wigan - started with two teenage debutants in their three-quarters, and Hull sensed that there were some seams to pick at. Fetuli Talanoa (left) celebrates scoring against St Helens as Hull recorded a shock victory . Hull took an early lead after forcing a repeat set from a fumbled high kick and then another from offside on the line. That pressure finally told when Joe Westerman and Leon Pryce combined to create the space for Shaul to slip through. Jordan Rankin added the extras to make it 6-0. A Saints penalty from a high tackle put them in a good attacking spot and from there nice work from Lance Hohaia and James Roby sent the supporting Tommy Makinson skipping through. Makinson tagged on the two to level the match. And Saints were soon back for more and this time a lovely short ball from Jordan Turner sent Louie McCarthy-Scarsbrook powering over the whitewash, with Makinson adding the goal . Tom Makinson, who brought Saints level after Shaul's early try, breaks away from two tacklers . The to-and-fro nature continued and a pair of Hull penalties gave them a great position to have another crack at the line with wing Curtis Naughton just managing to get the ball down despite tackle of Bailey to cut the deficit to 12-10 on 24 minutes. Saints very nearly hit right back with fresh-legged Alex Walmsley believing he had cashed in on a Hull dropped ball with a try, only for the in-goal touch judge to rule a knock on in the build up. Saints made a tactical switch at the break, with youngster Bailey withdrawn and the backline reshuffled. Hull hit the front eight minutes into the second half when former Saint Leon Pryce made a telling intervention, attacking the line and getting the ball down despite the tackle. Rankin's goal made it 16-12 to the visitors. Saints almost hit back immediately with a great break by Roby carving open the Hull defence, but although that play was foiled on the line they were soon back for more. Joe Westerman and Mark Minichiello stop Andre Savelio as Hull recorded a vital win at St Helens . And from a penalty on 54 minutes Turner, playing against his former club, showed some determination in driving towards the posts. Makinson improved to put Saints 18-16 ahead. Saints did suffer a stroke of bad luck when Adam Swift pieced the Hull left flank and was looking dangerous but then lost the ball. Hull forced an error when Hohaia was adjudged to have knocked on a high Pryce kick. From there the visitors piled on the pressure and that finally told when a floated wide ball sent Fetuli Talanoa over on 66 minutes. Rankin missed the goal but Hull had a two-point lead and looked determined to defend it. The visitors' defence holds firm to stop Josh Jones breaking through as Jordan Rankin brings him down . A penalty from a high tackle allowed Makinson to level from 30 metres nine minutes from time, but the Saints were hanging on. After a high kick was caught and returned quickly by Swift, Saints were soon back on the front foot, but a fumble by Ashworth on the halfway line turned the ball over. Hull countered ruthlessly with Shaul showing a great turn of pace and nimble footwork to turn Makinson inside out to run in from halfway. Rankin goaled and to compound Saints' misery the restart kick went out on the full. Hull worked their way down field with Rankin slotting another penalty to make the game safe with three minutes to play.",Weakened St Helens suffer another defeat against strong Hull side . Jamie Shaul scored late long-distance score to secure win . Inexperienced champions had looked like holding on until late shock .,8a5d6113450341efe19739fdffd2139a4c639746
"A gang of six men have been jailed for a total of 31 years after being convicted of a string of sexual offences against teenager girls. The offences, which ranged from inciting sexual activity with a child, to rape, happened in cars, woods or at the defendants' homes in Banbury, Oxfordshire. Oxford Crown Court heard how they lured victims to parties organised on social media and then began sexually abusing them. The men were found guilty in March and have now been handed sentences of between three and nine years in jail. Jailed: Ahmed Hassan-Sule, 21 (left) was sentenced to nine years' imprisonment. Mohamed Saleh, 22, (right) was imprisoned for four years and nine months . The girls, aged between 13 and 16, were targeted by the gang  at under-18s parties organised by Ahmed Hassan-Sule, 21, known as 'Fiddy'. One child described the parties as 'a place where girls would go and the boys would choose their targets'. The victims, who were described in court as 'emotionally immature' were abused from 2009 to 2014. Sentencing Hassan-Sule and the others in a court packed with friends and relatives of the defendants and victims yesterday, Judge Zoe Smith said: 'You put on charity events to raise money for your football club. 'This raised your profile among young people in Banbury and you saw yourself as a celebrity. 'Your friends helped put on these events and you became a sexually promiscuous group, not with your own girlfriends, but with girls who were young, vulnerable and lacking in maturity.' The judge rejected the argument put forward by the defence, who accused the girls of coming forward because 'it's better to be a victim than a slag'. Behind bars: Kagiso Manase, 26, (left) was jailed for four years and Said Saleh, 20, (right) was sentenced to four years' detention in a Young Offenders Institute . One of the victims told the Oxford Mail: 'When I used to go missing I would swear at my mum and I didn't realise I was being really nasty to her. The men put me against my family – it was really clever. When I started hanging around with them I felt important. 'I had no friends and they were the only people left to talk to. It was a big part of my life and I was scared. I felt like all my friends were making new memories and I wasn't part of them. 'Calling people ""slags"" as the defence did in this case stops other girls from coming forward. I would say to other girls to think about the future. I never wanted to do it. I never wanted to have sex with them but I thought that's what friends did.' Thames Valley Police launched Operation Reportage after receiving a tip-off about the men's activities and eventually tracked down numerous teenager girls who had been molested. Detective Inspector Steve Raffield from Banbury Force CID said: 'This result would not have been possible without the bravery of the victims. 'I would like to thank them for coming forward and giving evidence in this case. As in all trials without their testimony we would not be where we are today. 'As a result young people will be safeguarded while these men will have time to reflect upon their actions in prison.' Convicted: Takudzwa Hova, 21, (left) was sentenced to six years' imprisonment, while Zsolt Szalontai, 18, (right) was sentenced to three years' detention in a Young Offenders' Institute after being found guilty of rape . Justice: The judge rejected the argument put forward by the defence at Oxford Crown Court (pictured), who accused the girls of coming forward because 'it's better to be a victim than a slag' Those jailed on Friday afternoon at Oxford Crown Court were: Ahmed Hassan-Sule, 21, of Banbury, who was found guilty of 13 counts of sexual activity with a child and one count of assault by penetration. He was sentenced to nine years' imprisonment. Mohamed Saleh, 22, of Banbury, was found guilty of two counts of sexual activity with a child. He was sentenced to four years and nine months' imprisonment. Said Saleh, 20, from Banbury, was found guilty of one count of sexual activity with a child. He was sentenced to four years' detention in a Young Offenders Institute. Takudzwa Hova, 21, of Banbury, was found guilty of one count of sexual activity with a child, two counts of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and one count of rape. He was sentenced to six years' imprisonment. Kagiso Manase, 26, of Banbury, was found guilty of two counts of sexual activity with a child, two counts of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and one count of sexual assault. He was sentenced to four years' imprisonment. Manase had also pleaded guilty to possession of identity documents with intent. The offence related to being found in possession or control of a false South African passport and UK residence permit. He was sentenced to one year imprisonment to run consecutively. Zsolt Szalontai, 18, of Banbury, was found guilty of one count of rape.

"Two mistakes from Rangers keeper Robby McCrorie handed Celtic the Glasgow Cup as they clinched the trophy for the fourth time in eight seasons at Hampden. Josh Kerr took advantage when the Scotland under-17 star came for a corner and missed it to put the Hoops in front before McCrorie dropped a Mark Hill free kick over the line. With Old Firm bosses Ronny Deila and Stuart McCall looking on, it was the former who left happiest after seeing Tommy McIntyre’s side record a deserved victory.

Both teams line up ahead of the match which was played behind closed doors at Hampden Park . And as only local schoolkids and their parents were allowed in following trouble among fans at the last three finals, the match passed without any major off-field problems. Rangers took the game to their opponents but early headers from Aiden Wilson and Ross McCrorie ran past either post. Celtic hit back and began to dictate play, sitting further up the park the more time wore on and pressing well for an opener. Nine days after the Parkhead club’s first team was denied a clear penalty in the Scottish Cup against Inverness, their youths had another good claim. But Kyle Bradley’s handball in the box from a Regan Hendry shot went unnoticed by referee Stephen Graham before the midfielder fired the rebound straight at Robby McCrorie. Calvin Miller then shot just over from 20 yards, Hendry was denied again by McCrorie and Miller screwed another long-range drive inches wide as the Hoops looked more likely to net. Kerr fires the ball into the net to give Celtic the lead against Rangers in the 74th minute . Kerr slides along the Hampden pitch in celebration after putting Celtic ahead . Mark Hill (third left) is congratulated by his team-mates after doubling Celtic's lead . Just when it seemed they would get themselves in front, Hendry nodded past from close range when Miller picked him out with a great right-wing cross and it was a poor miss. Rangers were being restricted to playing on the counter and offered little in attack, with a low Ross Lyon shot that ran tamely wide being as close as they came. It took some strong defending to keep them level at the break too, with two last-gasp tackles from Wilson and Ross McCrorie being just enough to deny Hendry. Celtic kept pressing after the restart, with Theo Archibald firing a volley over and Rory Currie’s low attempt flashing off target. They almost paid for their slackness in front of goal, with Gers’ Sam Jamieson forcing a terrific tip over the bar from keeper Ross Doohan.

Rangers manager Stuart McCall (centre), assistant Kenny Black (left) and goalkeeping coach Jim Stewart watch the match from the stands at Hampden . The Light Blues took heart from that and began coming forward more but were just as sloppy with their finishing as Wilson nodded a Lyon corner over. Celtic responded once again, with Robby McCrorie smothering Mark Hill’s attempt, Dan Higgins aiming too high from 20 yards and McCrorie gathering Archibald’s grasscutter. Rangers made their best chances through Lyon and substitute Jamie Barjonas but rued their misses as Celtic scored twice in as many minutes and McCrorie was culpable both times.

"A monkey that was thought to have died out more than 50 years ago has been discovered alive in the remote rain forests of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Primatologists working in Ntokou-Pikounda National Park have captured the first ever picture of the Bouvier's red colobus monkey. Their discovery proves that the primate - which was first discovered in 1887 and is only known from three specimens - is not extinct. Scroll down for video . This is the first ever photograph of the Bouvier's red colobus monkey, which was thought to have been extinct . The image captured by researchers Lieven Devreese and Gaël Elie Gnondo Gobolo appears to show a mother with her young. Researchers now hope to study the monkey in an attempt to learn more about it. A new species of monkey has been discovered after scientists learned to distinguish it by the appearance of its penis. The white-cheeked macaque was discovered in the remote highland forests of south-east Tibet after researchers set up camera traps. The monkey has a distinctive rounded penis rather than the arrow shaped genitalia found on other species in the area. Officially named Macaca leucogenys, it earned its common name due to the pale whiskers on its chin and the side of its face. Dr Pengfei Fan, one of the researchers who discovered the new species and a biologist at Dali University, Yunnan, in China, said the new macaque had long been misidentified as another species. He said that due to the remoteness of the location in Medog County of Tibet, few biologists had been there. Mr Devreese said: 'Our photos are the world's first and confirm that the species is not extinct. 'No one knows anything about them. They live in an area where scientists rarely go, along the banks of a river a in a very inaccessible area.' Mr Devreese spent three months, after setting off in February, searching the jungles of Congo in an attempt to find the Bouvier red colobus monkeys, or Piliocolobus bouvieri. Together with his Congelese colleagues, he visited remote villages to ask locals if they had seen them and traced the locations of unconfirmed reports of sightings. A group of the monkeys were discovered living in the forests that sit along the Bokiba River in the Ntokou-Pikounda National Park. However, they found that the creatures appear to be extremely vulnerable to hunters involved in the commercial bushmeat trade in the area. Red colobus monkeys are among the largest primates in the forests of Congo and are prized by hunters. The animals are also poor at recognising threats, often believing they are safe in the trees. Rather than fleeing, red colobus monkeys tend to look down at humans from the trees. The last unconfirmed sighting of a Bouvier's red colobus monkey was in the 1970s and they are mentioned in a book from 1949 as living in swamp forests aong the Likouala and Sangha rivers. In his attempt to rediscover the monkeys, Mr Devreese launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise funds for the expedition on Indiegogo. A video is shown above . The Bouvier's red colobus monkey lives in stretches of jungle alongside rivers in the Congo (pictured above) The only previous examples of them had been collected more than 100 years ago. In his attempt to rediscover the monkeys, Mr Devreese launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise funds for the expedition on Indiegogo. Dr Fiona Maisels, from the Wildlife Conservation Society, said: 'We’re very pleased indeed that Lieven and Gaël were able to achieve their objective of not only confirming that Bouvier’s red colobus still exists, but also managing to get a very clear close-up picture of a mother and infant. 'Thankfully, many of these colobus monkeys live in the recently gazetted national park and are protected from threats such as logging, agriculture, and roads, all of which can lead to increased hunting.' James Deutsch, vice president for conservation strategy at the WCS, added: 'Confirmation that Bouvier’s red colobus still thrives in the this area reminds us that there remain substantially intact wild places on Earth, and should re-energize all of us to save them before it is too late.'",Bouvier's red colobus monkeys was last sighted in the Congo during 1970s .

"(CNN)There's an old saying which states the Cape Verde Islands are home to a greater number of musicians per square kilometer than any other country in the world. In truth, such a definitive claim may be nigh on impossible to prove. But there is a certain factual accuracy behind the legend: the important and proud relationship the Atlantic island country of just 500,000 people has with music. Situated roughly 350 miles off the west coast of Africa, Cape Verde has long been a mesh of cultures, history and races. The former Portuguese territory was once a key location for the transatlantic slave trade, a target for 16th century pirates and a refuge for exiled Jews. From this diverse melting pot were born the unique sounds of the batuque, morna, funana and other distinct musical styles. Now, Cape Verde is seeking to tap-into the spoils of this rich cultural heritage in a bid to help its economy flourish. Bereft of oil, gas, gold, diamonds or the conventional natural resources that have fueled growth in many other African countries, Cape Verde has had to look for alternative sectors to aid its development. And what's more alternative than a jiving, swinging, musical economy? ""Besides fish, it is pretty common (for Cape Verde) to say 'our biggest richness is in music and culture,'"" said Christine Semba of Womex, an international networking platform for the world music genre. The economic potential of music has been also acknowledged  by Cape Verde's prime minister, Jose Maria Neves, while the country's ministry of culture is run by Mario Lucio de Sousa, himself a popular musician. ""The future of our country lies in our capacity to create, our capacity to innovate,"" Neves said in reference to the music and the arts at a World Trade Organization conference in 2013. Other elements of the creative economy include handicrafts, fashion and visual arts to name but a few. However, a 2013 report from the UN Conference on Trade and Development noted that Cape Verde's creative sector remained a relatively small part of its economy with much room for improvement and long term planning. But that doesn't mean there hasn't been some promising early signs that music has the potential to play a key role in the future. One early musical success has been the Kriol Jazz Festival. The event, which is celebrating its seventh edition, took place in the capital city of Praia this past weekend. Artists including Grammy-winning U.S. singer Esperanza Spalding have been invited to perform, as have acts from the likes of Luxembourg, Brazil and, of course, Cape Verde. According to Harold Taveres, a liaison to the mayor of Praia involved with promoting the festival, ""KJF has become one of the most spectacular events in Cape Verde. ""We breathe the music in Cape Verde, we live with the music,"" he added. ""Now the festival has brought people from every corner in the world (to share in this)."" During the festival, bars, hotels and restaurants are full to the brim while taxi drivers are seldom unable to find a fare during what locals refer to as ""the week of party."" It's a lucrative trade, for sure. Yet in order to take full advantage of this bustling scene the country's ministry of culture, alongside some enterprising private sector figures, thought a deeper relationship with the music business was required. Enter the Atlantic Music Expo, a three-year-old conference and networking event that seeks to help Cape Verdean artists secure international exposure. This year's AME took place in the days before the Kriol Jazz Festival. Delegates, local musicians and their management teams were exposed to roundtables, workshops and talks on the intricacies of the global music business. ""We try to invite lots of producers and a lot of journalists from around the world to see the festival and the musicians from Cape Verde,"" said Jose Da Silva, long time manager of the late Cape Verdean songstress Cesaria Evora. Da Silva is one of the driving forces behind AME as well as being the founder of the Lusafrica and Harmonia record labels that aim to discover a new generation of artists from Cape Verde. He hopes that by exposing musicians to a range of experienced industry professionals and top-level musicians, they will become equipped with the tools and ambition to take the music of Cape Verde across the globe. Not only will this help launch the careers of artists and musicians (with all the respective behind the scenes business structures such developments require) but it will garner valuable attention for the country. This is where the greatest potential economic benefits lie. Tourism is expected to account for 20% of the country's GDP by 2024, according to research from the World Travel and Tourism Council. Getting Cape Verde's name out on the world stage through recognition of its rich musical culture is therefore increasingly important. ""Economically it's beneficial for the country because the money we would have to spend on the market to give the country this exposure in the world would be too big,"" Da Silva said. ""This way it costs less money."" Semba agrees with this, and highlights the joined up thinking of the government and private sector actors like Da Silva for special praise. ""In the long term, the whole country is behind this event,"" Semba said, adding ""this is a very innovative approach which we would like to see in many more countries."" It must be noted, however, that few countries have the same natural resources for music as Cape Verde. More from Marketplace Africa .",Cape Verde seeking to tap-into rich cultural heritage .

"Foreign workers will have to pay an average of £22,000 in tax before they can claim benefits under Tory plans to be unveiled this week. Migrants arriving in the UK will be banned from receiving handouts from the welfare state for four years, forcing them to pay tax and national insurance the state. Home Secretary Theresa May said the Tory manifesto will spell out plans to negotiate a new deal with Europe, including curbing access to benefits. Home Secretary Theresa May said the Tory manifesto will spell out plans to negotiate a new deal with Europe, including curbing access to benefits . Under the proposals, unemployed EU migrants in Britain will be banned from receiving state support, and would be deported if they do not get a job within six months of arriving. For those in work, they would be barred from claiming handouts like housing benefit or tax credits until they have being in the UK for four years. It means a migrant workers on an average wage will pay £22,600 in tax and national insurance over four years before they are able to receive state support. There will also be a ban on 'exporting' child benefit for children living in other EU countries. The crackdown was ordered after the government failed to meet David Cameron's target of cutting net migration to the tens of thousands. Latest figures show that in the year to September, 298,000 more people arrived in the UK than left. Mr Cameron rowed back from plans to limit freedom of movement across the EU after a backlash from German Chancellor Angela Merkel. But Mrs May today said the benefits changes would act to limit the appeal of coming to Britain from poorer parts of the EU. 'Our plan would remove a huge financial incentive for European migrants to come to Britain for the wrong reasons,' she told The Sun. 'Instead of claiming in-work benefits, under our plans the vast majority will pay into the system, contributing thousands of pounds.' Net long-term migration to the UK was estimated to be 298,000 in the year ending September 2014, a major rise on the 210,000 figure a year earlier . She said the Tories had made the immigration system 'fairer and more effective' than it was in 2010, but more was needed. The Home Secretary said: 'That's why our manifesto, which will be published this week, will spell out our plan to negotiate a new deal with Europe. 'The changes to welfare to cut EU migration will be a key part of our renegotiation with the EU, and we will put our reform package to the British people in a straight in-out referendum by the end of 2017. 'Labour oppose this plan, as they have opposed all the steps we have taken to create a fairer immigration system since 2010. Ukip talk a lot about immigration - but they don't have a serious plan for action.' Under the plans, migrants with jobs will only receive in-work benefits, such as tax credits, and social housing once they have been in the UK for four years.

Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said immigration was important for Britain but it needed to be 'controlled and managed'. Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said immigration was important for Britain but it needed to be 'controlled and managed' She told Sky News' Murnaghan programme: 'The practical policies are that we want to make sure we have stronger border controls and that means having 1,000 more border staff to actually do proper checks to follow up on visas.' Labour, she added, would change the benefit rules so that people coming to Britain could not claim benefits until they had been in the country for more than two years. She said: 'It's not happening, what have they done in the last five years, they haven't dealt with it. And the thing that is different about our approach compared to any other party is we would deal with the exploitation by agencies, recruitment agencies and employers, who are exploiting immigration to undercut wages and jobs, that makes the system unfair. 'You've got some recruitment agencies who are recruiting from abroad, we would change the law, make exploitation a crime.' The Conservatives, she added, should not be trying to restrict overseas university students at the same time as 'doing nothing' about illegal immigration.","Conservatives will ban in-work benefits for migrants for four years .

"Tony Pulis has discussed pre-season plans with Saido Berahino in an indication he plans to keep the striker beyond the summer transfer window. Berahino is likely to be away with Gareth Southgate’s England under 21 side in the Czech Republic until late June so Pulis has begun his preparations early. West Bromwich Albion were open to bids of £20million for Berahino in January and the 21-year-old has said he would leave to fulfil his desire to play in Champions League football. West Brom manager Tony Pulis has talked pre-season plans with Saido Berahino in an indication the England under 21 striker will remain at The Hawthorns beyond the summer . Berahino has been linked with a move away from West Brom after saying he wants to play European football . Pulis said: ‘Hopefully he's away with the under 21s so I have had a chat with him about pre-season and the time he'll have off but I haven't spoken about anything else to him. ‘I think the kid is happy here, he has played that way and certainly worked that way. We're more than happy to have him here because he has been very good.’ Berahino shares the same agent as Raheem Sterling, Aidy Ward, who was criticised by Brendan Rodgers over the Liverpool player’s contract stand-off. Pulis said: ‘Agents can have a massive influence on players in lots of respects. My argument to that is in the same in life, you get good agents and you get bad agents. Berahino is likely to be included in the England under 21 squad for this summer's European Championships . Berahino scored a vital goal in England's under 21 play-off with Croatia back in October . 'Professional footballers have been given a gift and they have a lifespan of about 10-12 years. We should never forget that. To be the best is what they should be aiming for. ‘If I had an agent I'd just say, 'Look after the money, make sure when I finish this job I have enough to look after my family'. I wouldn't be talking to my agent about football.’ Pulis added: ‘I can’t speak for Sterling and I can't speak for the agent as I haven't dealt with that but the one thing I have said about Saido, he has been fantastic here. ‘There's been a real change in his attitude, his commitment to everything we've tried to do has been brilliant.’",Pulis has spoken with his striker about pre-season plans .

"(CNN)A photo of a baby boy being pulled from the rubble of the Nepal earthquake has become the defining image of a disaster that has devastated the country. His tiny face is coated in dust from the debris that crashed around him as the earth shook on Saturday, April 25, killing more than 5,000 people and injuring at least twice as many more. His name is Sonit Awal, and he's just four months old. On Saturday, Sonit was at home in Muldhoka, Bhaktapur, east of the capital Kathmandu, when the 7.8-magnitude quake sent tremors through Nepal and neighboring countries, according to Kathmandu Today. The house collapsed, burying the child, leaving his father Shyam Awal frantically searching for him amid the rubble. A desperate Awal called the Nepalese Army, and they too scrambled through the dirt and debris until midnight, before giving up hope and leaving. Sonit's father had lost all hope of finding his son alive, the paper reported, until he heard faint cries from below. On Sunday morning, the soldiers returned and at 10 a.m they lifted Sonit clear of the fallen rocks, beams, bricks and dust that had trapped him for 22 hours. His rescuers held him high in their hands to the sun, though his eyes were still wedged tightly shut. Sonit's face was exposed during the whole ordeal, though a hooded top and shawl protected his head and body during the cold night spent under rubble. The baby was taken to Bhaktapur Hospital and found to be uninjured; . His unlikely rescue provides some hope to a country that has experienced so much loss.","Baby Sonit Awal found in rubble of Nepal earthquake, Sunday morning .

"A young Star Wars fan, who wrote a heartwarming note to the movies’ creator George Lucas asking whether he would allow Jedi Knights to marry in the future, was elated to receive a reply granting his request. Seven-year-old Colin Gilpatric, an aspiring Jedi Knight, was devastated to learn that achieving his dream might mean never being able to marry, as forming emotional attachments is said by the rules of the fictional order to lead Jedis to the 'dark side'. Desperate for a solution, Colin, who has autism, went directly to the man in charge: Star Wars director and writer Mr Lucas. Plea by post: Seven-year-old aspiring Jedi Colin sent a letter to George Lucas asking him to change the rule that bans the Knights from marrying . As character Anakin Skywalker's marriage to Princess Amidala led him to become a villain - and lord of the malevolent Sith Order, Darth Vader - Colin wanted to avoid the same fate, and pleaded with the Star Wars creator to make a change to the rules. 'With Colin, he was obsessing about it,' Colin's mother Peggy Gilpatric told Inside Edition: 'Finally, I was like, you know what, write to George Lucas and tell him how you feel and that's all that you can do.' 'Dear George Lucas,' Colin wrote in his letter. 'I don't like that a Jedi cannot get married. I want to get married without becoming a Sith. Please change the rule. 'P.S. I want to come to Skywalker Ranch please, Love Colin.' Soon enough, a package from Lucasfilm arrived for Colin in the mail, and his mother Peggy was on hand to film him opening it up. The letter: Colin, desperate not to end up like Anakin Skywalker - aka Darth Vader - in the film series, made his case to the Star Wars creator . The big reveal: Colin's mother filmed her son's ecstatic response as he realizes the package contains a plethora of Star Wars merchandise . In the video, Colin is ecstatic to find a stash of Star Wars goodies in the bag, including books and toys, accompanied by a letter addressing his question. 'It sounds like the Force is strong with you, and you are showing great wisdom by asking your question,' it said. 'To be a Jedi is to truly know the value of friendship, of compassion, and of loyalty, and these are values important in a marriage. The Sith think inward, only of themselves. 'When you find someone that you can connect to in a selfless way, then you are on the path of the light, and the dark side will not take hold of you. With this goodness in your heart, you can be married.' The letter was signed 'Your friends at Lucasfilm'. 'The Force is strong with me!': Colin is elated to have his question answered . Quite the response: Lucasfilm sent this letter to seven-year-old Colin to ease his mind about one day being able to get married . In the video showing Colin reading the letter for the first time, the young fan is delighted to say the least, exclaiming: 'I can get married? No way!' According to Colin's mother, the obsession with Star Wars has been a godsend for her son, who, as a result of his autism, struggles to share his emotions. 'A lot of autistic kids have a hard time understand processing emotions and the entire Star Wars universe has helped us that way,'she told Inside Edition. 'It’s very black and white. There’s a dark side and good side. 'It helped open up a dialogue about it feelings and emotions. There is a conception that some autistic kids don’t have emotions, but they do. It’s just finding the right outlet for them and the right way to express it.'","Traditional Jedi rules forbid any knights from marrying because it is thought it will lead them to the ‘dark side’ Colin Gilpatric, from Sacramento, was therefore concerned that if he became a Jedi, he wouldn’t be able to find a wife . The aspiring Jedi, who has autism, penned a letter to George Lucas to see if he would consider changing the rules .",352717cc7a4f41c9b24edc7c4b809cf57dc256a2
"A mutilated fox: hardly the most glamorous prop Ashley James has ever posed with, but in this case, that is precisely the point. The former Made In Chelsea star has joined forces with animal rights crusaders PETA on a hard-hitting anti-fur campaign directed at Harvey Nichols after the national department store abandoned its ten-year anti-fur policy. 'Harvey Nichols: Here's the Rest of Your Fur Coat,' the slogan reads, alongside an image of the 26-year-old animal lover, who is brandishing what appears to be a skinned fox - a fake one we've been assured. Scroll down for video . Dark: The former Made in Chelsea star has joined forces with animal rights crusaders PETA on a hard-hitting anti-fur campaign directed at Harvey Nichols after it abandoned its fur-free policy - (the fox isn't real) PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) is currently in talks with a number of billboard companies in the hopes of getting the poster mounted outside Harvey Nichols. 'I love animals,' Ashley told MailOnline. 'Having educated myself about the fur industry, it breaks my heart to think people allow such cruelty to continue by buying fur products.' Harvey Nichols, which has 12 locations around the world and previously stood against the fur industry, backtracked last year when it quietly re-introduced it. Priced between £300 and £1,500, the department store's current range includes coyote fur courtesy of Canada Goose, raccoon fur from Charlotte Simone and plenty of rabbit pelts from Vince. 'When I see people I know wearing fur, I will initiate the conversation by asking them if it's real or not. If they confirm that it's real, I express disgust,' Ashley said, . 'If they are interested, then I will tell them more about this cruel industry. I just want people to make informed decisions with their purchases. Anti-fur: 'I love animals,' Miss James, pictured, tells MailOnline. 'Having educated myself about the fur industry, it breaks my heart to think people allow such cruelty to continue by buying fur products' Boycotter: Miss James, pictured in London this week, leads a mostly vegan lifestyle and shops at fur-free stores including Liberty London, Selfridges, House of Fraser, Topshop and Oasis . 'If they know about the industry and still choose to wear fur, then that's fine - although I can't personally understand how they could do that. 'But I think a lot of people prefer to live in ignorance, and that's really frustrating.' In a statement to MailOnline, Harvey Nichols said: '[We are] committed to sustainable and responsible practice across all areas of [our] business, and ethical trading is an important part of this programme. 'We only source products from reputable brands, which includes seeking the assurance that the fur they use in products has been sourced responsibly.' However, in a recent exposé fronted by Paloma Faith, PETA went undercover on 'Origin Assured' fur farms, a label which is meant to give fur-stocking stores assurances about the animal welfare and conditions in which animals are bred and slaughtered. It found raccoons, rabbits and minks kept in filthy wire cages, sometimes alongside the rotting corpses of other animals. 'These animals were left to suffer from untreated injuries, including missing limbs,' PETA reports. 'Frightened and distressed, they often mutilate themselves and others in the cage, only to be slaughtered in the name of fashion.' Party line: In a statement, Harvey Nichols said, 'We only source products from reputable brands, which includes seeking the assurance that the fur they use in products has been sourced responsibly' Put a name to the face: Priced between £300 and £1,500, Harvey Nichols' current designer range includes fur from coyotes (left), raccoons (center) and foxes (right) When MailOnline asked reps at Harvey Nichols to clarify their position on exactly what made them change their minds on their anti-fur policy, communication ceased and they declined to make any further comment. PETA's foundation director Mimi Bekhechi points out: 'All fur is the product of a bloody, violent industry. We encourage consumers not to be deceived by Harvey Nichols' claims of selling 'humanely and ethically' obtained furs.' Before Ashley James knew anything about the industry, she admits she owned a rabbit fur coat. 'Needless to say I don't any more,' she said. 'I gave it to a Romanian charity called K-9 Angels, which use donated furs to keep rescued dogs warm in winter.' Cruelty-free: Miss James is a particular fan of designer Stella MCartney, who has been a lifelong vegetarian and refuses to even use leather in her collections. Pictured, her 2009 A/W campaign, starring an (alive) fox . Poster girls: Stars including Natalie Portman (left), Charlize Theron (center) and Jessica Chastain (right) are all vocal anti-fur campaigners . Just say no: Abbie Cornish (left), Ellen DeGeneres (center) and Sia (right) are also vegetarians who are strongly opposed to the trend . Ashley, who now leads a mostly vegan lifestyle, praises designers like Stella McCartney, another avid anti-fur protester, and shops at fur-free stores including Liberty London, Selfridges, House of Fraser, Topshop and Oasis. Harvey Nichols is not the only entity, or person, to have broken its anti-fur promise. Supermodel Naomi Campbell, who once posed for PETA’s infamous ‘I’d rather go naked than wear fur’ campaign, then went on to become the face of fur couturier Dennis Basso in 2010.

Naomi then went on to become the face of fur couturier Dennis Basso in 2010 (pictured) Lady Gaga, who also once spoke out against fur, did a very public reversal on the subject when in 2012 she declared that she ‘admired’ the beauty of animals in fashion, stating: ‘You see a carcass, I see a museum pièce de résistance.' Still, notable celebrities who strictly avoid fur include, but are not limited to; Natalie Portman, Abbie Cornish, Jessica Chastain, Sia, Charlize Theron, Pamela Anderson, Pink, Kesha, and Ellen DeGeneres.

"Paul Smith, having bravely lost his two challenges to Arthur Abraham in Germany, now finds himself in pole position for a third successive joust against a reigning world super-middleweight champion. Only this time the elder of Liverpool's fine family of four fighting brothers will not be boxing for a title, even though it is against a far more formidable champion. Andre Ward, still ranked by many among the top five pound-for-pound boxers in the world despite 17 months out of the ring, sees Smith as the ideal warm-up opponent, possibly before a rematch with Carl Froch.

"The producers of the TV show Made In Chelsea pride themselves on featuring some of the poshest young ladies and gentleman in London. But even by their standards, Mark-Francis Vandelli is well-to-do - the privately educated son of a multimillionaire industrialist and model wouldn't have to work a day in his life if he chose not to. But if you weren't already envious of the reality star, he has now opened up his watch collection to the Evening Standard, showing off some of the 16 eye-wateringly expensive timepieces that he has been collecting since his teens. Scroll down for video . Made In Chelsea star Mark-Francis Vandelli is a keen collector of expensive watches . The 26 year old has got into the habit of buying a new watch each year, so that he will have an impressive collection by the time he reaches middle age. Many watch enthusiasts would argue that Mark-Francis has already reached that goal - he currently owns a number of pieces that are worth several thousand pounds. In a new interview with the newspaper, he revealed his favourite items and the history behind them. The include a Bulgari Bulgari Chrono 42, a Cartier Tortue Collection Privée and a Rolex yellow gold Oyster Perpetua. Mark-Francis's most expensive watch is a Cartier white gold Moonphase, which he bought from a shop on Sloane Street in Chelsea earlier this year. Mark-Francis's most expensive watch is a Cartier white gold Moonphase (left), while one of his flashiest is a  Bulgari Bulgari Chrono 42 (right) It cost £32,000 and caught his eye because it has a sun or a moon than move on rotation depending on the hour of the day. One of the flashiest watches in his collection is the Bulgari Bulgari Chrono 42, which he purchased on holiday in Italy and can be bought secondhand on the internet for £6,5000. He said of the item: 'When I was 16 my grandmother gave me the first prototype of the Bulgari Bulgari, which the Bulgari family had given her in the 1950s - I think it's one of the only ones that was actually hand engraved around the bezel.' Mark-Francis ended up buying this modern version after he fell into a river wearing his grandmother's version while out rowing at school. Mark Francis favours a Cartier Tortue Collection Privée timepiece because it is no longer made (left), while he wears a Rolex yellow gold Oyster Perpetual when out raving in East London (right) While many of his watches are hard to come by, Mark Francis favours a Cartier Tortue Collection Privée timepiece in particular because it is no longer made, meaning he would be unlikely to be caught out wearing it at the same time as another man. Similar versions can be bought on the internet for around £9,000. He told the newspaper: 'Cartier doesn't make this one any more, which I love. I did see someone else wearing it once, however -  I was at the Wolseley and it was this fat American, I was mortified.' And finally, for the man who has a watch for every occasion - the timepiece that he wears when visiting East London... a Rolex yellow gold Oyster Perpetual. Similar watches can be bought on the internet for £8,000. He said: 'You can swim in it, sleep in it, throw it around, go to a rave.

The star, 27, says she's always been a fan of the range and has been using it for years so when they asked her to work with them, she was 'over the moon' The star also spoke about how important looking good was to her and how she takes a 'less is more' approach to make-up. Her beauty regime is fairly minimal and she simply cleanses, tones and moisturises every day and treats herself to a facial every other week to rehydrate her skin. She swears by Simple face wipes, Origins serums and Garnier and Kiehl's moisturisers. In terms of her diet, Michelle has been using the SoulMateFood delivery service and says she will be continuing the healthy eating plan when she comes back to Manchester while filming over the next couple of weeks. Loved by Daisy Lowe and Una Foden, the alkaline food delivery service allows you to create your own healthy menus, which are delivered straight to your front door. 'It's perfect for me as I am always on the go at the moment and I can always have it with me,' she said of the meal service. When she's cooking for herself at home, Michelle starts the day with scrambled egg on brown toast with tomato, followed by a high protein banana smoothie with peanut butter. For lunch, she has a turkey or chicken salad sandwich on brown bread and dinner is salad with chicken or prawn. The flawless star, who found fame on Coronation Street, reveals that her simple but effective beauty secrets are  drinking lots of water and always taking her make-up off before bed . The actress likes to snack on fruit, nuts and her favourite treat: popcorn. Bodywise, Michelle says she tries to work out as much as possible and whilst there's 'always an excuse not to go', she ends up feeling better after a workout. 'I've been very busy at the moment but if I have time, I go to the gym 3-4 times per week.' She doesn't, however, do any cardio and simply sticks to weight training to tone up. 'Cardio is good for getting you sweating but it slims you down and I think it makes me look too skinny,' she admitted. She also swears by the 8-minute abs YouTube video, which she does when she gets home from the gym. As for the future, Michelle says she 'may consider' doing an accessories and jewellery range but for now, she's focussing on her acting duties. 'I start filming next week for new movie,' she revealed. 'I am also in talks for another film, so fingers crossed it will go well.' In between posing in beauty shoots and designing her own Lipsy range, Michelle has been filming for new projects and is in talks for a new movie .","Michelle unveils sneak peak of Lipsy designs ahead of launch on Wednesday .

"(CNN)Michele Bachmann is comparing President Obama to the co-pilot of the doomed Germanwings flight. ""With his Iran deal, Barack Obama is for the 300 million souls of the United States what Andreas Lubitz was for the 150 souls on the German Wings flight - a deranged pilot flying his entire nation into the rocks,"" the Minnesota Republican and former representative wrote in a Facebook comment posted March 31. ""After the fact, among the smoldering remains of American cities, the shocked survivors will ask, why did he do it?"" Andreas Lubitz, the co-pilot of Germanwings Flight 9525, is accused by authorities of deliberately crashing the plane in the French Alps. He died in the crash along with 149 other crew and passengers. The motive of the March 24 crash is under investigation, though investigators are looking in to whether Lubitz feared a medical condition would cause him to lose his pilot's license. Many comments posted on her Facebook page blasted the former representative. Melissa Coca wrote, ""Comparing this tragedy to anything is moronic and despicable."" Michael J Pristash wrote, ""Your allusion is so inappropriate and divisive, not to mention disrespectful on so many levels. Shame on you."" Some also accused her of taking desperate measures to stay in the public eye. Lynda Anderson wrote, ""Posting outrageous things in a pathetic attempt to stay relevant?"" Negotiations are coming down to the wire between Iran, the United States and other nations on restricting Tehran's nuclear program to prevent the ability to develop an atomic bomb.

Bachmann is no stranger to voicing her opinion on the President's dealing with Iran, personally telling him to ""bomb Iran"" during the 2014 White House Christmas Party. ""I turned to the president and I said, something to the effect of, 'Mr. President, you need to bomb the Iranian nuclear facilities, because if you don't, Iran will have a nuclear weapon on your watch and the course of world history will change,'"" she told the Washington Free Beacon.

"The widow of US Navy SEAL Chris Kyle has revealed the painful moment she first broke the news to their two children that their father had been murdered. Taya Kyle told ABC's Robin Roberts she gathered her son, Colton and daughter, McKenna and prepared to tell them. 'I remembered just closing my eyes, the tears rolling down and me just trying to breathe,' said Kyle. Reveal: Taya Kyle had to do everything she could from falling apart in front of her kids when she explained to them their father had been killed . Recovery: Taya has given an interview to 20/20s Robin Roberts about her life since Eddie Ray Routh was convicted of killing her husband, American Sniper, Chris Kyle . Taya, 40, was speaking to Roberts for a special edition of ABC News' 20/20 which will air on Friday, May 1 and will catch up with the widow of Kyle, whose story is portrayed in the blockbuster movie, American Sniper. It will be the first in-depth interview that Kyle has given since former Marine Eddie Ray Routh was found guilty of capital murder on February 24 for shooting dead Chris Kyle and his friend, Chad Littlefield. He was automatically handed a life sentence without the possibility of parole and Taya Kyle broke down in tears on the stand when she gave evidence on the first day of the trial. During the course of their interview, Kyle jokes with Roberts that she never thought she would marry 'a cowboy' but was 'excited' by falling in love with him. 'I never probably thought a cowboy would want me,' she said. 'And I said I would never marry somebody -- a SEAL either. So… 'there you go with your plans again,' right?'

Taxing and emotional testimony: Taya Kyle wipes the tears from her eyes as she gives evidence from the stand during the trial of Chris Kyle's killer, Eddie Ray Routh in February . Eddie Ray Routh pleaded not guilty to killing Chris Kyle and said that he shot him and his friend Chad Littlefield dead because he was suffering PTSD. The jury decided he was guilty of murder and knew what he was doing . Taya has also written a new book, 'American Wife: A Memoir of Love, War, Faith and Renewal' which will go into detail about her marriage and the aftermath of Chris's death. The book is released on May 4 and Taya hopes it will draw a line under her recent events. In March, Taya published a heartbreaking letter to mark their 13th wedding anniversary. Taya Kyle pledged to love her late husband 'all the days of my life' in the touching tribute in which she described the moment her future husband gave her two dozen roses during one of their first dates. Kyle, who was the subject of last year's Clint Eastwood-directed movie American Sniper, was gunned down by fellow war veteran Eddie Ray Routh at a shooting range in Rough Creek, Texas, on February 2, 2013. Taya Kyle was the first witnesses called during the trial. The judge also allowed her to attend the public gallery afterwards to watch the trial . American Sniper: Eddie Ray Routh shot Chris Kyle dead in February of 2013. In February of 2015 he was found guilty for the death of the war hero . That day, Kyle had offered to help Routh deal with his post traumatic stress disorder but was instead shot dead along with his friend Chad Littlefield. Now, in the wake of a turbulent year that involved her husband's killer's trial and an appearance at the Academy Awards for the film made in his name, Mrs Kyle has written of her enduring love for her husband. Posted on Facebook in March, her letter said: 'I feel you in my heart and soul so strongly. I am more blessed to have been your wife than anything else in my life. 'Today, I am thinking of our new relationship, when you rented a boutique hotel room in San Diego and surprised me with two dozen long stem pink roses when we arrived. You got us tickets to a local improv type play. I knew then I was the luckiest girl in the world to be with tough, romantic, loving you. 'Today, I have a choice. I can bury myself under the covers and acknowledge the pain of missing you and mourn the future anniversaries without you. Or, I can celebrate never having a day without you in my heart because you loved me enough to leave me a lifetime of memories and beauty. 'I am somewhere in between today. I loved you yesterday, I love you know, and I will love you all the days of my life.'

"Rome (CNN)The Italian navy has boarded and retaken control of a fishing boat that had been seized hours earlier by gunmen off the coast of Sicily, the Italian military said Friday. The boat, named Airone, was intercepted some 90 kilometers (56 miles) from the Libyan port of Misrata, according to a statement from the Italian Joint Forces. An Italian naval unit boarded the fishing boat and took custody of a Libyan soldier on the vessel, according to a statement by the Italian Navy. It said during the operation, rifle shots were accidentally fired, and one of the seven fisherman on board was slightly injured. The Airone, carrying three Sicilians and four Tunisians, had embarked from Mazara del Vallo in Sicily five days earlier to fish for shrimp. The Airone's captain said there were about 10 other ships in the area when it was seized, according to Vito Mazzarino, the boat's owner. ""At a certain point a tug boat came up and flanked the fish boat and some Libyans came on board,"" Mazzarino said, quoting the captain, Alberto Figuccia. ""They were armed. And at that point chaos erupted."" Italy is a major gateway to Europe for migrants from North Africa. Thousands of people each year make the dangerous sea journey from North Africa to Europe's Mediterranean coast, to flee war and poverty. Italy registered more than 10,000 migrants in the first three months of 2015, according to the International Organization for migration. On Monday, gunmen on a speedboat fired shots in the air and sped away with a wooden boat that was being used to transport migrants, according to Frontex, the European Union's border management agency. That incident occurred 60 nautical miles from the Libyan coast. The 250 migrants on board had already been transferred on to a different boat, Frontex said on its website. ""This is a sign that smugglers in Libya are running short of boats and are more willing to use weapons to recover those used to transport the migrants,"" said Fabrice Leggeri, Frontex's executive director, in a news release.

"A virulent strain of bird flu continues to hammer the Midwest and the virus recently took its biggest toll yet after it hit a farm in Iowa that held nearly 10 percent of the state's egg-laying chickens. Poultry producers and scientists had been hoping warmer weather would knock down the deadly bird flu virus. But the U.S. Department of Agriculture said Monday that the H5N2 bird flu virus had been found at a farm in northwest Iowa's Osceola County - prompting a massive bird cull. Bird flu: Chickens stand in their cages at a farm near Stuart, Iowa. Discovery of the bird flu on an Iowa turkey farm has raised serious concerns that the bird killer could find its way into chicken barns in the nation's top egg-producing state and rapidly decimate the flocks that provide the U.S. with its breakfast staple . The confirmation means up to 5.3 million hens there must be destroyed in a state that produces one in every five eggs consumed in the country. Seven other Midwestern states have also been hit by the virus, dooming nearly 7.8 million turkeys and chickens since March. The virulent strain in question is the H5N2, a highly contagious virus that kills commercial poultry quickly once it gets into a barn. Yet the risk to the public is considered low and infected birds are being kept out of the food supply. So far, only two egg operations have been hit — the one in Iowa and one in Wisconsin. Except for a couple of backyard flocks, all the other cases in the Midwest have been at commercial turkey farms. Minnesota has had 28 turkey farms hit, far more than any other state. Turkey farm: In this photo provided by Bethany Hahn is a flock of turkeys at a Minnesota poultry farm. The country's poultry industry may have to live with a deadly bird flu strain for several years according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture . Precautions: Most commercial poultry barns are shut tight to keep the diseases out, and poultry farms with good biosecurity strictly limit who is allowed in - but is does not always protect poultry from bird flu . Officials say that's because Minnesota is the top turkey-producing state, and its thousands of lakes and ponds are attractive to migrating ducks and other waterfowl. H5N2 and other highly pathogenic strains have also been found since late last year among wild birds, backyard flocks and commercial farms in some western states and British Columbia. U.S. Department of Agriculture officials say the virus could be a problem for several years. The USDA's chief veterinary officer, Dr. John Clifford, said last week that while new cases should drop close to zero once the weather warms up and kills off the virus there's 'very likely' to be a resurgence this fall when the wild waterfowl that are natural carriers of avian influenza fly south for the winter. An outbreak that kills tens of thousands of birds certainly can cost a farm dearly. The government doesn't compensate producers for birds that die of the disease itself, but it does reimburse them for birds that have to be euthanized as a precaution. That gives farmers an incentive to report suspected outbreaks and deal with them swiftly. Outbreaks do not always drive up the cost of turkey eggs and chicken as the toll nationwide represents just a small part of U.S. production. Hormel Foods Corp., which owns Jennie-O, said Monday that it will sell less turkey this year because of the outbreaks. Turkey prices around the holidays often have nothing to do with the costs of production. Retailers often sell turkeys at a loss just to draw in customers who'll stock up on stuffing mix, cranberries, sweet potatoes, pies and other traditional favorites. However, several precautions have been put in place at farms to control the outbreak and stop the spread of bird flu. Most commercial poultry barns are shut tight to keep the diseases out, and poultry farms with good biosecurity strictly limit who is allowed in. Other precautions  include workers often having to shower on their way in and out, wear protective coveralls and step in disinfectant to kill viruses on their boots. Equipment coming in and out is typically sanitized. But despite these measures, the system doesn't always work. According to experts, the only way it can work is if everyone does everything right all of the time - which can prove difficult. And if rodents and wild birds sneak into a barn it can bring the virus that way. Farms tend to be extremely diligent at handling  bird flu as turkeys die quickly and know how to spit the early warning signs. Less severe symptoms can be similar to colds and flu in humans, or a flock turning quiet. While vaccines have been used around the world to protect flocks against various bird flu strains ahead of time, this strain is new to North America. Once an infection is confirmed at a farm, all surviving birds on the property are typically killed to prevent it from spreading. These flocks are usually killed by pumping a water-based foam into the barn, following guidelines from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The foam suffocates the birds within minutes. If birds die they usually cover them in compost in the same barn where they died. Composting is a widely used and approved method throughout the industry to dispose of dead birds. It's thought to be an effective method as the heat generated by composting is enough to kill flu viruses and other pathogens commonly present in poultry such as salmonella. The compost is then used as fertilizer.","The deadly H5N2 bird flu virus has been found at a farm in northwest Iowa . Up to 5.3 million hens must be destroyed in the state to contain outbreak .

"Carol Chandler at Southwark Crown Court to answer charges of historic sexual abuse . A female teacher accused of abusing a pupil at Chancellor George Osborne’s old school appeared in court today. Carol Chandler, 53, allegedly molested a boy, under the age of 14 who was a pupil at top independent school St Paul’s in Barnes, south west London, during the 1980s. She is facing three counts of indecent assault and two counts of gross indecency between 1983 and 1985. Chandler appeared at Southwark Crown Court in a mint green wool skirt suit, black court shoes and silver jewellery. The charges have not yet been formally put and Chandler has not entered pleas. Judge Jeffrey Pegden QC told Chandler: ‘Yes madam, you have heard the next important hearing date for the case is going to be on 9 July.’ He added: ‘I renew your bail until that date on the single condition that is obviously necessary and I am sure you wouldn’t dream of it anyway - not to contact directly or indirectly any prosecution witnesses.’ Occupying a 45-acre site beside the Thames, near Hammersmith Bridge, St Paul’s boasts facilities including a purpose-built art gallery and 230-seat theatre, which are second to none. Famous former pupils of the top school, established in 1509, include the Chancellor, who attended the £32,000-a-year school in the eighties, Mumford and Sons banjo player Winston Marshall and TV presenter Dan Snow.

"If it feels as though summer has come early, that’s because we’re already enjoying August temperatures. This week’s remarkable spell of sunshine in southern England is to continue – and warm up. The temperature in the South is forecast to reach 24C (75F) today and 25C (77F) tomorrow, surpassing the highest seen so far this year, the 21.9C (71.4F) recorded in London on Friday. The delightful weather, caused by warm air blowing up from the Azores, is creating conditions we might usually experience in July or August. Scroll down for video .

Stunning: A fog bank rolling onto Portsmouth from the Solent, after cool air moved quickly over the surface of the warm water . Britons are so confident of a scorching summer that bookmakers are receiving tens of thousands of pounds in bets on this year breaking records. The record for the hottest day ever in Britain was set more than a decade ago in August 2003 when temperatures hit 38.1C (101F) in Gravesend, Kent. Coral’s price on this summer being the hottest on record has fallen from 10/1 to 2/1, while Ladbrokes has 5/6 on this spring being the warmest ever. There has been a surge in bets after the recent warm weather, and William Hill has 8/1 odds that the temperature will exceed 100F (37.8C) this year. Ladbrokes is also offering 8/1 that the April record of 29.4C (84.9F) set in 1949 in Camden, north London, will be broken by the end of the month. The forecast for today is actually warmer than the 18C (64F) average daytime temperature in August, and way ahead of the 11C (52F) normally expected in April. This weekend will be slightly cooler than the dizzy heights expected tomorrow, but the clear skies and above-average temperatures are forecast to last well into next week. Met Office spokesman Laura Young said last night: ‘We are expecting some really good temperatures over the next few days. Unless you are in north-west Scotland, which will see quite a lot of rain, it will be dry and sunny. ‘On Tuesday we could see 23C to 25C (73F to 77F) in prolonged sunshine. That is double the daytime average for this time of year. ‘Wednesday will be 22C to 25C (72F to 77F) or higher in places. Thursday will probably be slightly cooler but still in the high teens. Wednesday warmth: Most of England and Wales will enjoy sunshine over the next few days with temperatures hitting 24C later this week .

After that we can be less certain.’ The spell of warm weather, which has now lasted more than a week, has seen people flocking to the nation’s beaches. Among them were swimmers in the South-West who were stunned to see giant jellyfish in the waters. Barrel jellyfish, which have tentacles up to six feet long, were spotted near Hope Cove in south Devon. The species are usually found in the sunnier climes of the Mediterranean, but the rising temperatures and warmer seas have meant that more plankton becomes available and the jellyfish have headed closer to shore. The species is harmless to humans, but with the weather warming up then other jellyfish could be heading our way. Beachgoers are advised not to touch jellyfish in case they have chanced upon a species with a powerful sting. Devon vet Rupert Kirkwood, whose son Henry had an encounter with one of the jellyfish while kayaking, said: ‘No doubt they are encouraged to put in an appearance by the sunny weather. I have never seen them so early in the year. Could be the start of a bumper jellyfish year.’ After the bad smog seen late last week in the South-East, the air will be relatively clear for most parts over the next few days.

Over the water: Sunrise near Cullercoats bay in North Tyneside, as Britain basked in the hottest temperatures of the year so far . But pollution levels will increase again on Thursday and Friday, particularly in the South-West, where Cornwall and Devon are expected to see fumes rise to dangerous levels. The Met Office three-month contingency forecast for public officials predicts that there is an average chance of a warmer than usual summer. But thankfully the chances of it being much colder than usual is just 10 per cent. A spokesman said: ‘Unfortunately, the weather we get in April doesn’t necessarily tell us anything about the kind of summer we can expect. ‘We’re still in the midst of spring, so it’s far too early to say what the months of June, July and August may hold.’ Ladbrokes spokesman David Williams said yesterday: ‘The money flooding in on weather bets is unusual and has taken us a bit by surprise. ‘This is the first time we have seen quite significant sums wagered on this specific bet - so obviously people out there sense something hot is coming.’ And Nicola McGeady from Coral added: 'The British public are obsessed with the weather and that is reflected in the interest in weather betting.'

Green for cold, red for hot: These graphics from Netweather show the forecast temperatures for tomorrow (left) and Wednesday (right) A third of weather bets to Ladbrokes have come from punters in the South East - the area that has enjoyed the best conditions over the past week. And the bookmaker said its biggest bet of the year so far has been £1,000 on 2015 to be the hottest year on record at 8/1 - placed in January. Meanwhile, Coral - MailOnline's official betting partner - said it has even had a request from someone asking to bet on rain every day this summer. The Met Office has confirmed that hotter-than-average temperatures are more than twice as likely than below-average conditions until June. It said in a long-range forecast that ‘much of the tropical Pacific Ocean remains warmer than average and close to El Nino thresholds’. El Nino - the warming of Pacific sea surface temperatures - can trigger drought in south-east Asia and Australia as well as floods in South America. The Met Office says most climate models ‘now suggest that sea surface temperatures will exceed El Nino thresholds in late spring or early summer’. With Britain set to bask in its hottest temperatures of the year so far this week, thousands of parents and children are expected to head to the beach. But firefighters have warned those thinking about stripping off and diving into the water - with more than 650 water-related deaths in the UK in 2013. The act, known as ‘tombstoning’, can lead to people suffering ‘cold water shock’ when the air temperature is much higher than that of the water. London Fire Brigade assistant commissioner Peter Cowup said: ‘Rivers, lakes and canals may look inviting, especially on a hot day and after a drink. ‘But it’s important to realise that open water has hidden dangers that can hurt you and at worse, kill you.’ On the first-ever Drowning Prevention and Water Safety Week, firefighters added that the 16-30 age group was worst-hit by water deaths in 2013. Giant jellyfish are being spotted off Britain earlier than normal thanks to the warm weather, it was claimed yesterday. Kayaker Rupert Kirkwood, a seasoned sea watcher, was stunned to see the giant creatures off Hope Cove in Devon. The barrel jellyfish, which have tentacles up to 6ft long, were pictured floating next to Mr Kirkwood’s kayak in the sun-drenched blue waters. Up close: Rupert Kirkwood's son Henry had this encounter with a barrel jellyfish near Hope Cove off the coast of south Devon . The species are usually found in more tropical areas such as the Mediterranean Sea. But the rising temperatures and warmer seas have meant more plankton is available - and the jellyfish have headed closer to shore.

The Red Cross says that anyone who does get stung should not try to use urine to provide relief as the healing properties of this are an urban myth. Vinegar is said to be far more effective. Vet Mr Kirkwood said: ‘No doubt they [are] encouraged to put in an appearance by the sunny weather. ‘I have never seen them so early in the year.

"Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini is braced for a ferocious derby clash at Old Trafford this weekend. The fading Barclays Premier League champions take on Manchester United on Sunday having unexpectedly fallen behind their arch-rivals in the table. For most of the season City, if not looking like mounting the strongest of title defences, at least seemed destined for a top-two finish. Manuel Pellegrini is relishing the prospect of taking on Manchester United with Manchester City on Sunday . David Silva (centre) leaves the pitch looking despondent after City's 2-1 loss to Crystal Palace on Monday . Sergio Aguero (centre) is blocked out by Damien Delaney (left) and James McArthur of Palace . That is now far from certain following a dramatic slump in fortunes while United, ordinary for much of the campaign, appear to have clicked into gear in the last month. With just a point separating them in third and fourth, the stage is set for a battle of high intensity. Pellegrini said: 'It is difficult to have a more intense match than you have in the Premier League every week but of course you add a little bit more for a derby of the city. Both teams want to win. 'It is important to be the winning team in the city - that gives an extra plus for the game, not only intensity is better but quality. 'Both teams have very good players and both managers like to play an attacking system so I hope (for a good game for) the fans, for whom you play, and after that I hope we can win.' City have held the edge over United in recent contests and could register a fifth successive derby win for the first time in their history with victory this weekend. A win would also see them become the first club to beat United five times in a row in the Premier League. United had the last laugh over City after the first of their current sequence of derby wins by winning the league in 2013 but since then the blues have had the bragging rights. Pellegrini said: 'I think that they have a lot of respect for our team because last year it was the team that dominated not only the derby but I think we dominated also the Premier League. It is not easy for a team. 'In the last three years we won two and in the other we were runner-up. This year we have been runner-up the whole year. 'We have to play seven games more and we will see what happens at the end of the season and in which position we will stay, but I think for them, they must try to beat the team that has been better in the last few years.' City are likely to come up against an altogether different opponent than the Crystal Palace side that frustrated them last Monday. Louis van Gaal's United have been fluid of late, winning impressively against Tottenham, Liverpool and Aston Villa to take their run of victories to five. Facing a side that is not inclined to sit back could suit City but Pellegrini is dismissive of suggestions that might make it easier than in their most recent away losses at Palace and Burnley. The Chilean said: 'You never know but I don't think it will be easy. It will be different. 'United are a big team that like to play - especially with Van Gaal. He's always an attacking manager. We hope we will see a good game. 'We have a different problem, we have to make sure we don't make mistakes because they have important and technically very good players.' Despite a wretched run of just four league wins in 11 games since pulling level at the top with Chelsea on New Year's Day, Pellegrini maintains all possibilities remain open to his side. City boss Pellegrini remains positive about City's achievements this season despite dropping down to fourth . Vincent Kompany is an injury doubt for Manchester City's clash against Manchester United on Sunday . 'I never think in a negative way,' said the 61-year-old, who will await the outcome of a fitness test on captain Vincent Kompany's hamstring injury. 'I don't think of one, two or three points difference when you have to play seven games. 'When you have mathematical options in football you must never give up and always believe you can do it.'","Manchester City are in fourth, a point behind rivals Manchester United .

"Given the inexorable march of the past 12 months in one direction, perhaps it is only appropriate that Rory McIlroy should spend the eve of the Masters on Wednesday with a member of the celebrated boy band of that name. But it is not lookalike Harry Styles who will carry the Northern Irishman's bag in the par-three tournament but keen golfer Niall Horan as McIlroy looks for a little light relief before his first attempt to complete a career Grand Slam. One Direction released their debut album in 2011, the same year McIlroy won his first major, so you could say they have mirrored each other, hit for greatest hit. Rory McIlroy watches a tee shot during a practice round prior to the start of the 2015 Masters Tournament . McIlroy alongside his caddie Caroline Wozniacki during the 2014 Par 3 Contest  in Augusta . McIlroy celebrates with his  Wozniacki on the 9th hole during  the Par 3 contest at Augusta National Golf Club . At last year's Masters, McIlroy piqued the interest of one or two photographers when then fiancee Caroline Wozniacki donned the caddie's famous white boiler suit. He might find the curiosity levels are even greater this time, for One Direction are even more popular in the US than in Britain. Between them, Niall, an honorary member at Mullingar, Westmeath, and Rory might do more to stir up interest in golf among the young than any number of 'old fogey' initiatives. 'We met in Australia at the end of last year and he was saying he had never been to The Masters,' said McIlroy. 'I said if you're available on the Wednesday you're more than welcome to carry the bag. Niall's really excited.' Niall Horan will swap girls screams for Augusta greens as he caddies for golfer McIlroy . McIlroy hits a putt in the rain during a practice round prior to the start of the 2015 Masters Tournament . McIlroy looked more subdued than excited at his press conference yesterday, possibly because he knew what was coming. On the one hand, he feels as ready as he ever will for his tilt at history. On the other, he had to spend 30 minutes with journalists wanting to trawl over his poor record at Augusta. Here is a sample: Why is your record so bad on the par fives, Rory? Why have you never birdied either the first or the 10th holes? Why have you left here for the past five years with at least one 77 on your score card? What the hell's wrong given all the advantages offered by your length off the tee? McIlroy  walks over the Nelson Bridge with caddie J.P. Fitzgerald during a practice round . To be fair, he answered them all with politeness. After all, there was nothing there he had not analysed and dissected countless times himself. McIlroy knows better than anyone he has no chance unless he does better on the long holes. He brought up the point raised in the Sportsmail graphic from last Saturday, which compared his record on the par fives last year with that of winner Bubba Watson. 'Just look at the two par fives on the back nine on Sunday,' he said. 'I had a nine iron in my hand for my second shot on both and I walked off with two sixes. Two fours I'd have finished third. McIlroy waits under an umbrella during a practice round prior to the start of the 2015 Masters Tournament . 'It's something I've been thinking about a lot. Look at Bubba, who played them in eight-under for the week to my level par and beat me by eight shots. 'I've just been too aggressive at times. I had four sixes on par-fives last year, so if I can clean up those, I'll have a chance to win.' As for those 77s, he said: 'It's not like I'm having a bad 18 holes. It's always just a bad nine holes that causes the damage and it's usually on a Friday, like last year. But I am better equipped now to handle it if things don't go right way. Mentally, I'm in a far better place.' McIlroy conceded that the circus surrounding Tiger Woods's return had not been unhelpful and the draw has worked out pretty well, too. The place you do not want to be come Thursday is in one of the last two groups, like Woods, but McIlroy has been treated kindly, with a mid-morning threesome alongside Americans Phil Mickelson and Ryan Moore. 'I don't think I've played alongside Phil at Augusta so that's perfect,' he said. 'We always get along well and he has a great record here. It will be fun to watch him.' It was this time last week, while practising in Florida, that McIlroy pronounced himself ready to go. 'It's been great not to have to think of anything technical while I'm playing,' he said. 'I've been able to enjoy the build-up.' Rory McIlroy waits with his caddie Fitzgerald in the rain during a practice round  at Augusta National Golf Club . Asked who he saw as favourite, McIlroy went for Bubba — ironic given a recent ESPN survey among the pros ranked Watson as the least favourite. 'I take it as I need to improve as a man,' said Watson, with the sort of annoying comment that explains his unpopularity in the first place. As for McIlroy, he knows where he needs to improve. 'You look at this course and it should fit me perfectly from tee to green,' he said. After One Direction on Wednesday, it'll be his turn to generate some roars.","One Direction star Niall Horan will caddie for Rory McIlroy on Wednesday . 1D released their debut album in 2011, same year McIlroy won first major .

"Dele Alli has set his sights on the Toulon Tournament with England Under 20s as he aims to cap a season that will live long in his memory. The 19-year-old's impressive performances for Milton Keynes Dons earned him a dream move to the Premier League with Tottenham Hotspur in a £5million deal rubber-stamped in January. Loaned back to the Dons for the remainder of the season, Alli's 14 goals have helped keep them in touch with the automatic promotion places in League One.

Dele ALli has impressed for MK Dons this season leading to Tottenham signing him for £5m in January . Alli laid on two assists for team-mate Carl Baker during the Dons' 3-0 home win over Doncaster Rovers on Tuesday night, a result that leaves them a point behind second-placed Preston North End with two matches to play. The season has seen progress for Alli on the international scene too, with good performances for Sean O'Driscoll's Under 19 team. His absence through an ankle injury was a big blow as the team failed to qualify for the Under 19 European Championships but Alli could compensate for that by winning a place in Aidy Boothroyd's Under 20 squad for Toulon next month. Alli told The FA.com: 'I'm not going to lie and say it isn't [a target]. You want to do as well as you can. The aim is to eventually get into the first team. Alli keeps his eyes on the ball as he shoots  during MK Dons' victory against Doncaster Rovers on Tuesday . Alli was named Football League Young Player of the Year at the Football League Awards last Sunday . 'Obviously the next step to that is the Under 21s and that's the aim for me to try and break into that squad or the Under 20s. 'I really enjoyed playing for the Under 19s last year, especially with the team we had and the manager. 'We played a real attractive game, and we liked to play football and that is what I'm used to so it wasn't like I was going away and playing a whole new story. 'I've really enjoyed it and obviously my aim is to eventually get into the seniors. So any age group I play in, the better for me. 'The aim next year for me is to play at the highest level I can for England.' Alli poses alongside FA chairman Greg Dyke (left) at the Awards in London on Sunday night . England have been drawn in Group B of the Toulon Tournament with China, Ivory Coast, Mexico and Morocco. They begin their campaign against Morocco on May 28. His influential performance against Doncaster continued another good week for the midfielder, who was voted Young Player of the Year at the Football League Awards on Sunday night. 'It was a real honour to win it - especially with the players I was up against in Patrick [Bamford of Middlesbrough] and Nathan Redmond [of Norwich]. 'They're great players, and from playing with Patrick last season [during his loan spell at MK Dons], I know just how good he is, so it was a great honour and achievement for me. 'But it wouldn't have been able to do it without my team-mates.'",Dele Alli is hoping to be selected to play for England Under 20s next month .

"That's not a light lunch, it's just bad lighting, say administrators at a Virginia School standing up for their FLOTUS approved school meals. A concerned mother took a photo of her child's lunch consisting of a dull looking fish fillet, a whole wheat bun, and corn and then posted it to social media this week. Virginia’s Portsmouth Public Schools say that their lunches are in compliance with Michelle Obama's federal lunch rules. Scroll down for video . Look appetizing?: A corned mother took a photo of her child's lunch, a dull looking fish fillet, a whole wheat bun, and corn and then posted it to social media this week . Reasoning: Virginia’s Portsmouth Public Schools say that their lunches are in compliance with Michelle Obama's federal lunch rules . After the photo began circulating the web, Food Service Coordinator Jim Gehlhoff said the lunch was 'concerning' but that it may not actually be as bad as it looks, reports EAG News. 'Poor lighting and food presentation make this lunch unappealing,' he said in a statement released to the media. 'The meal in this photo and other meals served by Portsmouth Public Schools meet nutritional and USDA requirements,' said Gelhoff. According to the school district's lunch menu from their website, Tuesday’s lunch options included spicy Cajun fish with brown rice, a cold cut turkey sandwich, a chef's salad, fresh orange or canned fruit, and 1 per cent skim milk. Wavy took a poll asking people if the though the lunch seemed acceptable and 92.3 per cent of people who voted didn't believe that the lunch looked palatable. 'No child should go to school hungry – it’s that simple,' committee chair Rep. John Kline said at a House Education and Workforce Committee this week. 'Today’s discussion is not about whether we agree on this basic principle; I am confident we all do. Instead, our discussion today is about beginning a larger effort we will continue in the coming months to ensure the best policies are in place to help reach this goal,' he continued. Another paltry lunch: This lunch posted in October shows another American student's dissatisfaction with the school meal . Squeamish: This school lunch allegedly shows a maggot found in a child's green beans . The School Nutrition association doesn’t think Michelle Obama's lunch regulations are to blame but they think a funding increase is needed for the National School Lunch Program. ‘That will help school food authorities afford the foods that we must serve, but unfortunately that won’t make students consume it,’ SNA President Julia Bauscher said during testimony. ‘And that’s what we’re also focused on…finding ways to ensure students will eat the healthy foods that we’re making available to them and not throw it in the trash.’ Two months ago Michelle Obama again came under fire for the 'shortcomings' of her Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act scheme. Students and parents  posted photos of Michelle Obama's 'measly' school lunches in February and in October of last year. The images, which were all posted on Twitter with the hashtag #ThanksMichelleObama, range from a slice of moldy salami in a wrap and a green hotdog to a small portion of salad with a side of cheese, to a maggot found in a child's green beans.

"If you struggle to get your child to go to school in the morning, don’t blame them - it could be your fault. Our willingness to learn - or lack thereof - is significantly influenced by our genes, according to a large study. The researchers found that 40 to 50 per cent of the differences in children’s motivation to learn could be explained by their genetic inheritance from their parents. Our willingness to learn is significantly influence by our genes, according to a study by Goldsmiths University in London and Ohio State University. More than 13,000 twins aged nine to 16 took part in the research (stock image shown) Psychologists from Goldsmiths University of London, and Ohio State University in the US studied more than 13,000 twins aged nine to 16 from six countries, including the UK, Canada, Japan, Germany, Russia and the US. The researchers said they were surprised by the results, believing that the twins’ shared environment - elements such as the teachers and the family that they had in common - would be a larger factor than genetics. Instead, genetics and non-shared-environment factors had the largest effect on the children’s motivation to learn, whereas the shared environment had negligible impact. Genetics and non-shared-environment factors were found to have the largest effect on the children’s motivation to learn, whereas the shared environment had negligible impact (stock image shown) A review of 308 studies involving more than 1.1 million children has now completely overturned this long-held stereotype. The study, which looked at data from 1914 to 2011, suggests that girls do better in school than boys - and have been doing so for at least 100 years. The research also claims that girls do better at all ages, in all subjects and all over the world. According to the data, compiled by the University of New Brunswick in Canada, girls have been outperforming boys throughout their academic careers, from infant school to secondary school. Accordingly, we should not jump to conclusions that a poor teacher or the child themselves is to blame for a lack of motivation in the classroom, the researchers said. ‘We had pretty consistent findings across these different countries with their different educational systems and different cultures,’ said Professor Stephen Petrill, of Ohio State University. ‘It was surprising. The knee-jerk reaction is to say someone is not properly motivating the student, or the child himself is responsible. ‘We found that there are personality differences that people inherit that have a major impact on motivation. ‘That doesn’t mean we don’t try to encourage and inspire students, but we have to deal with the reality of why they are different.’ The results don’t mean there is a specific gene for how much children enjoy learning, he added, but they suggest a complex process, involving many genes and gene-environment interactions that help influence a child’s motivation to learn. The study will be published in the journal Personality and Individual Differences.","Willingness to learn is significantly influence by our genes .

"Ethel Rider, who has severe dementia, fell from her bed at the Half Acre Care Home in Radcliffe, when she was being turned to prevent bed sores . Two care home workers who left a mute dementia patient in agony after she fell on the floor, then lied about what had happened, have been jailed. Ethel Rider, 87, suffered a broken pelvis and was left ‘cowering’ in pain after falling from her bed. But even though the grandmother was in agony, her carers failed to seek medical help and simply lifted her back into bed. Because she is mute, Mrs Rider was unable to tell anyone what had happened. It was only 24 hours later that a nurse realised she was in agonising pain and called an ambulance. The injury occurred because one of her carers, Susan Logan, had tried to turn her by herself – against the proper procedure at the private home. But when asked what had happened, Logan and her supervisor, Lauren Gillies, lied, saying Mrs Rider had fallen out of bed. Yesterday both were beginning six-month prison sentences after a judge branded them ‘idle’, saying they had cut corners to give themselves longer breaks. Afterwards the pensioner’s family slammed the carers’ ‘disgusting’ betrayal and said they were pleased both had been jailed. The Daily Mail’s Dignity for the Elderly campaign has repeatedly highlighted examples of poor care in residential homes and on NHS wards. Mrs Rider, a retired factory worker, moved into the Half Acre Care Home in Radcliffe, near Manchester, where staff working in pairs were meant to turn her in bed every two hours. But on May 19 last year, Logan, 59, was trying to turn Mrs Rider by herself when the pensioner fell out of bed. Bolton Crown Court heard how it may have been some time before the emergency alarm was called and Gillies, 25, arrived to find the grandmother in pain and on the floor. ‘She was left on the floor for 40 minutes,’ said Jonathan Turner, prosecuting. ‘She was then hoisted back into the bed. No ambulance was called and the story was devised between the two of them.’ The court heard how Mrs Rider, who now has the mental capacity of a baby, is mute and would have been unable to convey the pain of being hoisted back into bed with a broken pelvis. Care workers Lauren Gillies, 25 (left) and Susan Logan, 59, (right) have been jailed for six months each . Logan, of Radcliffe, and Gillies, of Ramsbottom, admitted wilful neglect. Judge Timothy Stead told them: ‘What you did between the two of you was outrageous. Your decisions have been described as stupid, but I would use a stronger word. They were criminally wrong.’ Mrs Rider’s daughter Julie Murphy, 52, from Radcliffe, said: ‘I am satisfied they have been jailed. What they did is disgusting.’ Four Seasons Health Care, which runs the home, said: ‘We are very sorry for the distress caused to Mrs Rider and her family as a result of the actions of the carers.’ A spokesman for the care home said they were 'very sorry for the distress caused to Mrs Rider and her family'","Ethel Rider, 87, dropped from her bed at Half Acre Care Home in Radcliffe .

"An Oregon lawmaker proposed legislation Monday creating uniform standards for hand dryers in public restrooms. The bill says that the recent proliferation of powerful dryers is efficient, but can sometimes trigger ringing of in the ears, or cause discomfort for people with development or sensory disabilities. The measure would require all new or replacement dryers to operate at a noise level no louder than 84 decibels. According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that is about as loud as a school cafeteria. A measure proposed to the Oregon legislature would require all new or replacement dryers to operate at a noise level no louder than 84 decibels, about as loud as a school cafeteria. (File photo) It also wouldn't allow hand dryers blowing air downwards to blow air faster than 115 mph, in case the hand-dryer manufacturer doesn't label the decibel level. Bill sponsor Democratic Sen. Chris Edwards told the Senate Committee on Business and Transportation that the new generation of hand dryers used to elicit episodes in his autistic son, who would cry and cover his ears when he heard them. It's not the hand-dryer motor that's too loud, Edwards said, it's the 'air knife' against the hand that can cause a sharp, shrill sound. 'I almost didn't bring this bill because this is not the most consequential bill of the legislative session. We all know that,' Edwards said. Democratic Senator Chris Edwards (left) sponsored the bill after his autistic son had episodes after hearing loud hand dryers. Republican senator Chuck Thomsen (right) says he prefers paper hand drying . 'But nonetheless there are those of us that just find these hand dryers to be extraordinarily obnoxious and disruptive to family members.' The bill would also 'requires downward blowing hand dryer to not blow air at an air velocity that exceeds 115 miles per hour'. High-speed, efficient new hand dryers, such as the Dyson Airblade or the Excel Xlerator, are fast replacing the old models, which often left hands still dripping wet. Still, there are some who would prefer if hand dryers were a thing of the past altogether. 'The new ones are faster, but I still would ban them all and go back to paper,' said Republican Sen. Chuck Thomsen of Hood River. The bill, SB 488, is scheduled for a hearing on Wednesday.",Bill would require all new dryers to be no louder than 84 decibels .

Michael Koncz said: 'It's a real mess right now... I can only surmise the motivation is greed and an attempt to manipulate the tickets, otherwise why the hold up?

"Hit rap trio Migos have been arrested on the first leg of their U.S. tour after police discovered drugs and guns inside their van during a college gig. Rappers Quavious Marshall, 24, Kirschnick Ball, 20, and Kiari Cephus, 23, were escorted off the Georgia Southern University campus mid-performance on Saturday night and taken into custody. According to NBC News, all of the band members have been denied bond - meaning they might not be able to fulfill their upcoming tour dates. Migos were next due to perform at the Ksu Convocation Center in Georgia before traveling on to a number of other states including Wisconsin, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania and New York. From left to right: Hip hop rappers Quavious Marshall, 24,  Kirschnick Ball, 20, and Kiari Cephus, 23, have been arrested on the first leg of their U.S. tour after drugs and guns were found in their van . Authorities said that they suspected the music stars were in possession of drugs when 'a very potent smell' of marijuana was detected coming from their two tour buses. When Migos left to perform at Georgia Southern University's Hanner Fieldhouse arena over the weekend, investigators seized the opportunity to conduct a search. Multiple guns, marijuana and another undisclosed drug were discovered inside the vehicles,  officials said. They added that the discoveries 'were intensely concerning' as they had been brought to a university-sponsored event where over a thousand students were congregated. In the spotlight: According to NBC News, all of the band members have been denied bond - meaning they might not fulfill their upcoming tour dates . Bad habits? Migos pose with friends for a group photo, posted to social media . The three band members - best known for their 2013 single Versace and their 2014 track Fight Night - were arrested after leaving the stage. They reportedly face charges of drug possession; possession of firearms in a school safety zone; and possession of firearms during the commission of a crime. It wasn't known early Monday if they had attorneys. Phone calls and emails to the group's management team by the Associated Press were not immediately returned. About a dozen other suspects - all occupants of the two vans - were also taken into custody following the concert. Information about them and the charges they face were not immediately available. The arrests took place during the school's annual spring concert. Migos - which formed as a group in 2009 - had contracted with Georgia Southern to perform at the event, the sheriff's office said.","Quavious Marshall, 24, Kirschnick Ball, 20, and Kiari Cephus, 23, were escorted off the Georgia Southern University campus  on Saturday night .

"(CNN)Ever had a headache so big, you felt like drilling a hole in your head to let the pain out? In Neolithic times trepanation -- or drilling a hole into the skull -- was thought to be a cure for everything from epilepsy to migraines. It could even have been a form of emergency surgery for battle wounds. But while there is still conjecture about the real reasons behind the mysterious procedure, what is known is that the implement often used to carry out the primitive surgery was made from one of the sharpest substances found in nature -- obsidian. Obsidian -- a type of volcanic glass -- can produce cutting edges many times finer than even the best steel scalpels. At 30 angstroms -- a unit of measurement equal to one hundred millionth of a centimeter -- an obsidian scalpel can rival diamond in the fineness of its edge. When you consider that most household razor blades are 300-600 angstroms, obsidian can still cut it with the sharpest materials nano-technology can produce. Even today, a small number of surgeons are using an ancient technology to carry out fine incisions that they say heal with minimal scarring. Dr. Lee Green, professor and chair of the Department of Family Medicine at the University of Alberta, says he routinely uses obsidian blades. ""The biggest advantage with obsidian is that it is the sharpest edge there is, it causes very little trauma to tissue, it heals faster and more importantly it heals with less scarring,"" he said. ""It makes for the best cosmetic outcome."" He explained that steel scalpels at a microscopic level have a rough cutting edge that tears into tissue, a function of the crystals that make up the metal. Obsidian, meanwhile, cleaves into a fine and continuous edge when properly cut. Dr. Green said he once helped documentary makers produce a program on surgical technology in ancient Egyptian, setting up a blind test on the cutting power of obsidian. Using cultured-skin burn dressing, a substance composed of skin cells, he made an incision with a modern scalpel and a parallel incision with an obsidian scalpel. The host of the program was then invited to look at the cuts under a video microscope and tell the difference. ""It wasn't hard to tell the difference at all -- as soon as he turned around everyone in the studio was like 'Ohhh',"" Dr. Green said. ""Under the microscope you could see the obsidian scalpel had divided individual cells in half, and next to it the steel scalpel incision looked like it had been made by a chainsaw."" Modern obsidian scalpels look nothing like the decorative flint-knapped knives of Neolithic man, often resembling their modern counterparts in everything except for the blade edge, but Dr. Green said they are a very different animal. ""The feel is very different because obsidian has no 'bite,'"" he said. ""If you look under the microscope at a steel scalpel edge it looks almost like a saw, it has teeth, whereas obsidian is smooth even microscopically. ""It's a very different feel to work with and you have to practice before you start using it in surgery. ""You also have to be careful not to nick yourself with it because you don't even feel it!"" And Dr. Green believes incisions made with these blades heal faster. He said a colleague who needed a mole removed agreed to undergo an experiment where half the procedure was carried out with an obsidian scalpel and the other half was removed with steel. ""What's really fun is seeing it heal,"" he said. ""Four weeks later the difference was quite remarkable -- there was very much a difference in scarring."" In Germany, the manufacturer Fine Science Tools produces obsidian scalpels which can be used in situations where the patient may have an allergy to steel or metal. ""For studies where trace metals from ordinary scalpel blades cannot be tolerated, these very special obsidian scalpels may provide the answer,"" the company says. At €99 per scalpel ($107.40), they represent a considerable saving on their diamond cousins which the company prices at €712.50 ($772.60). But there has been little academic research into the efficacy of obsidian blades compared to steel scalpels, and they do have disadvantages: Obsidian scalpels are not Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved, and they are extremely brittle and prone to breaking if lateral forces are applied -- meaning they are unlikely to ever be in widespread use. Dr. Green, whose scalpels were manufactured for him by an expert flint-knapper and archaeologist Errett Callahan, concedes the Stone Age scalpels are not for everyone. ""If it was let loose on the market there'd be far too many injuries from it,"" he said. ""It's very fragile and it's very easy to break pieces off.""",Obsidian can produce cutting edges many times finer than even the best steel scalpels . Some surgeons still use the blades in procedures today .,029f5f6775ecd8b5fad0dc0e55ab4a9754fcad8f
"Ed Balls has been accused of treating the public with 'contempt' after dismissing as a 'joke' the infamous Labour note admitting the party had blown the nation's finances. The shadow chancellor said the letter, left in the Treasury by the former Labour minister Liam Byrne in 2010, was just a 'jokey note'. Mr Byrne's glib note to his successor as Treasury Secretary stated: 'Dear Chief Secretary, I'm afraid there is no money. Kind regards – and good luck! Liam.' Scroll down for video . Damaging: Labour's Liam Byrne sent left this handwritten note to his successor before he left the Treasury in 2010 . The note has become emblematic of Labour's fiscal irresponsibility in office and was used by David Cameron in the seven-way leaders' debate earlier this month. When the Coalition took office in 2010 the budget deficit had reached more than £150billion – more than 10 per cent of the entire size of the economy. But Mr Ball insisted the note admitting that Labour had blown the nation's finances should not be taken seriously. He told BBC West Midlands: 'Liam Byrne's note was a jokey note… of the course the money hadn't run out.' Mr Balls said Labour would cut the deficit – still running at £90billion a year – every year. He said: 'Nothing in our manifesto is going to require additional borrowing. I think in tough times, people want a government which will make tough decisions, and will make the sums add up, and that is what we're saying very clearly today.' But he was asked if Labour was 'credible' and could be trusted with the economy. Mr Balls said: 'I think people want to know the sums add up. People know that the global financial crisis wasn't caused by Labour's spending – it wasn't Labour's spending on nurses and doctors which meant the Lehman Brothers investment bank went bankrupt in New York. 'Liam Byrne's note was a jokey note, of course the money hadn't run out.' Ed Balls, pictured in Birmingham today, said the letter, left in the Treasury by the former Labour minister Liam Byrne in 2010, was just a 'jokey note' Mr Balls blamed the Lib Dem minister David Laws for leaking the note. He said it was supposed to be a private note, adding: 'It was supposed to be a piece of humour. In fact, in that year, the government spend hundreds of billions of pounds, so of course the money hadn't run out, but there was a large deficit, and we had to get it down, and we needed to get it down in a fair way. 'The reason why we're more credible than the Tories now is that they're not people who understand the need for change in the economy, it's not been all in it together, they've not even balanced the books – it's going to take a Labour government to do it.' Former Treasury Secretary Liam Byrne left the note to his successor David Laws in 2010 . The Tories this morning slammed Mr Balls's remarks – claiming they showed that he had not learnt the lessons from the great economic crash. Treasury minister David Gauke said: 'The fact that Ed Balls thinks the debt they left the country was a 'joke' goes to show the contempt they hold the public in. 'It is clear Labour has not learnt the lessons of the past and would do the same all over again - more taxes, more borrowing and more debt.' The letter has haunted Labour for years, allowing Tory and Liberal Democrat ministers to prove the nation's coffers were empty. The letter consisting of just 18 words it offers no apology or justification for the state of the nation's finances, only a glib 'good luck' to whoever was left to clear up the economic mess. Written in blue ink on government note paper, it was opened by Lib Dem David Laws who became Chief Secretary to the Treasury when the coalition was formed. Lib Dem Mr Laws said: 'He left a note which frankly does sum up precisely the state of the Treasury when he left it. I think it is refreshing that a Labour politician has been prepared to admit that.' Mr Byrne has admitted he will regret it for the rest of his life. He said: 'It was a very foolish thing to do. 'I suppose I did think there was a convention amongst honourable members that private correspondence would stay private. 'There's obviously a very old tradition of these notes that goes back to the 1930s. I felt disappointed that some very old conventions had been cast aside for political advantage.'","Letter was left in the Treasury by the former minister Liam Byrne in 2010 .

"Stock market returns have averaged 16 per cent a year under David Cameron's Conservatives party, compared to just under nine per cent under Labour . Shares have performed nearly twice as well under Conservative governments than under Labour over the last 45 years, according to figures published today. Stock market returns have averaged 16 per cent a year under the Tories compared with just under 9 per cent under Labour and just over 9 per cent under the current Coalition. The figures, in an analysis for the Daily Mail by investment company Hargreaves Lansdown, are a further boost for David Cameron and George Osborne ahead of the general election on May 7. Ed Miliband is struggling to win over business men and women as well as investors who are worried about a Left-wing Labour government’s attitudes to enterprise. A survey of FTSE 100 bosses this weekend showed 70 per cent believe a Labour government under Mr Miliband would be a ‘catastrophe’ for the economy. The analysis by Hargreaves Lansdown shows investors – including millions of workers saving for a pension – fare better under the Conservatives. Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ‘The stock market has performed twice as well under a Conservative government as it has under Labour, according to performance statistics dating back to 1970.’ The analysis shows that companies have also performed better under the Tories with profits up by an average of 11 per cent a year under the Conservatives and 6 per cent under Labour. Writing in the Daily Mail, Mr Khalaf said: ‘Over the last 45 years there have been five Conservative governments, five Labour governments, and the current Coalition. ‘Over that time the UK stock market has returned on average 16 per cent a year under Conservative rule, compared with 9 per cent under Labour. ‘Markets can be capricious beasts in the short term, but on average this trend reflects the growth in UK company profits under the two parties.’ However, he said events on the global stage ‘are far more important to the UK stock market than the next resident of Number 10’. He added: ‘Looking back over the last 45 years, the waxing and waning of the stock market has been driven in large part by overseas influences, and is not commanded from Westminster. This makes sense when you consider how globalised most industries are.’ Experts have warned that a hung parliament could send financial markets into a tailspin and the pound and shares crashing. A survey of FTSE 100 bosses  showed 70 per cent believe a Labour government  would be a ‘catastrophe’ for the economy. The analysis by Hargreaves Lansdown shows investors fare better under the Conservatives . All the major pollsters are predicting that no party will win an overall majority. George Buckley, UK economist at Deutsche Bank, said: ‘The 2015 UK general election is set to be the most unpredictable for nearly a century. ‘Polls suggest that neither of the two major parties may have sufficient support to secure an outright majority. ‘There may be no good outcome for investors.’ A hard-hitting report by BlackRock, the largest fund manager in the world, said ‘a soothing outcome for the markets is hard to imagine’ given Labour’s anti-business policies and Tory plans to hold a referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union. ‘Labour would be tough on business – and might be perceived as lacking fiscal responsibility,’ the US giant said in the report. ‘A Conservatives-dominated Cabinet would pave the way for an unsettling referendum in 2017 on the UK’s EU membership. ‘Whoever wins – and the result could take some time to emerge – will lead a weak government likely to pass only watered-down legislation.’","Shares have performed nearly twice as well under Tories, new figures show .

"Aaron Hernandez left behind his life as a millionaire star athlete today, swapping a designer suit for a set of gray scrubs at a prison  where he will begin a life sentence for murder. It is perhaps fitting that Hernandez was booked at MCI Cedar Junction in Walpole, a prison just across the freeway from Gillette Stadium where he used to play for the New England Patriots. Hernandez hasn't set foot in the stadium since June 2013, when he was arrested under suspicion of murdering Odin Lloyd, who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fianceé at the time. On Wednesday, a 12-person jury found Hernandez guilty, sentencing him to life in prison without the possibility of parole due to some especially heinous aspects of Lloyd's killing. Scroll down for video .

Nothing to smile about now: Hernandez slumped down in his chair on Wednesday as a guilty verdict was read (left). Pictured on the right during happier times, playing for the Patriots . Hernandez was shocked by the decision, mouthing 'You're wrong', before slumping to his seat - perhaps seeing the riches to rags reality of his new life. Hernandez has vowed to appeal the decision. Directly after court, Hernandez was taken to the 700-inmate facility that will serve as a stark contrast to his former home - a $1.3million mansion. Hernandez arrived at Cedar Junction around 1pm for booking and was given the prison number W106228. The booking process took about two hours, and was probably not the most comfortable of experiences. According to a report by WBUR, new inmates at the facility are taken downstairs into the basement where the intake center is located. It is there that they change into their new uniform of gray scrubs and laceless canvas shoes, turning over their personal clothes to be either incinerated or mailed home. New home: Hernandez is starting his sentence at maximum-security prison MCI Cedar Junction in Walpole, Massachusetts (pictured above) Stately: Before his arrest, Hernandez lived in a $1.3million mansion in North Attleborough, Massachusetts (pictured above . They then post for a new mugshot and are fingerprinted before sitting in a special chair that scans their bodies for possible hidden objects. All new inmates receive a paper bag containing seven pairs of underwear and a specially-designed razor and pen that can't be used as a weapon. Jerry-rigged weapons are something Hernandez should be concerned with, according to Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hogson. Sheriff Hogson spoke with WHDH after the ruling on Wednesday and said that as the focus of a high-profile case, Hernandez will be targeted in the prison. 'It depends how he's classified or where he'll be, but it's always a possibility, always a concern,' Hodgson said. Labor: Workers at Cedar Junction's prison manufacture license plates for 50 cents an hour - a far cry from the $40million contract extension Hernandez received from the Patriots in 2012 . The food at Cedar Junction was described by a Boston Globe reporter as 'marginally edible'. Hernandez pictured above eating chicken after a Patriots game . Some other aspects of prison life may not be up to Hernandez's standards either - such as the 50 cents an hour inmates are paid to manufacture license plates. In 2012, the Patriots extended Hernandez's contract for five years in a $40million deal that was unprecedented for a tight end. Also in 2012, he signed a deal to be a spokesman for shoe brand Puma. And for a former professional athlete who's used to eating large satisfying meals, Hernandez may lose his appetite in the cafeteria where the food was once described by a Boston Globe reporter as 'marginally edible'. Cedar Point is where all male inmates are booked when they start their sentences in Massachusetts, so Hernandez will eventually be moved to another facility in the coming weeks or months, .

"She's won the London Marathon three times but this weekend Paula Radcliffe says she'll be happy to finish at all regardless of her position. The 41-year-old mother-of-two has battled back from injury to take part in the 26.2 mile race in the capital and a result won't be running with the other female elites but with the masses. She said this week: 'I'm going in unfit and unprepared for a marathon, but I'm hoping my body can remember once it gets out there how it's supposed to do it.' Scroll down for video . Paula Radcliffe finishes the London Marathon on Sunday after running with the masses to bring down the curtain on her professional running career . Paula was delighted she could return to London to run the marathon again . The mother-of-two has won the London Marathon three times, including in 2003 when she set her phenomenal word record time of 2 hours 15 minutes and 25 seconds . 'Unfit' for Paula actually means a time most runners can only dream of, and she's still likely to clock one of the fastest times of the day from a British woman. It will be an emotional run for Paula who will be presented with the the inaugural John Disley Lifetime Achievement award in honour of her achievements, which include setting a still unbeaten world record time of 2 hours 15 minutes and 25 seconds in London in 2003. Her great success over the years has also come with some heartache as she has never won an Olympic medal and often been let down by her body as she's pushed it to her limits. So as she prepares to run the marathon - supposedly for the last time - FEMAIL looks back on the career of the inspirational running super mother... Paula started running for Bedford and County from a young age, left, and won numerous races as a junior before progressing to take the European cross-country in 1998, right . The GB vests kept coming but she missed out on a medal at the Sydney Olympics in 2000 . Paula gave her all at the 2000 Olympics but was out-sprinted in the final moments and finished fourth . Paula's talent for running was evident from a young age and, under the coaching guidance of Alex Stanton at Bedford and County Athletics Club, she became accustomed to winning races on the domestic circuit. By the time she was a teenager, she had pulled on the first of her many Great Britain vests, winning junior races at the World Cross Country Championships and on the track. As a student at Loughborough University, she gained a first-class degree in modern languages while continuing to keep up her training regime. It was as student that she met her husband, Gary Lough - himself a talented middle distance runner - who went on to become her manager and training partner as well as the father of her two children. After leaving university, Paula embarked on her career as a full-time athlete and continued to have success in cross country races and on the track. She again lost out on a medal at the 2001 World Champs - which led to a public spat with husband Gary Lough who shared her disappointment . It was in Edmonton that Paula also made her stance on drugs in sport clear . But at major championships her valiant efforts to win a medal kept resulting in her getting out-sprinted in the home straight. She was fourth in the 5000m at the 1997 World Championships, fifth at the European Championships over 10,000m a year later and then fourth at the Sydney Olympic Games. At the World Championships in Edmonton in 2001 she was determined to make the podium - but after front-running she was again out-kicked in the final lap. This disappointment was her most famous as it led to a very public row with Gary - who criticised her race tactics when many thought he should have been consoling her. Gary was portrayed as a villain in the press - something that hurt the couple deeply. Success came on the track in 2002 as she won gold at the European Champs . She also took the gold in the 2002 Commonwealth Games 5k in front of a home crowd in Manchester . Her popularity soared as she was awarded an MBE in June 2002 and later that year was voted the BBC's Sports Personality of the Year, pictured here holding the coveted trophy . Speaking to the Evening Standard in 2012,  Paula said such heated arguments occur because: 'Gary understands what makes me tick and wants to support me as much as he can to achieve that. 'Sometimes that can cause blow ups - we are both strong-minded individuals but we have always said to each other that we should say what we want all the time. We never sleep on an argument because that is dangerous.' It was also in Edmonton that Paula made a public stand against drugs cheats holding up a banner saying 'EPO cheats out'. She's remained a staunch anti-drugs campaigner throughout her career and has called for tougher testing measures. Despite this, she's also had to face accusations that she couldn't have achieved her marathon World Record clean - as it's a time that hasn't been surpassed in 12 years. She said earlier this year she finds such unfounded accusations 'horrible'. 'I get it all the time. People saying ""she couldn't have run 2.15 clean"" but I know I can be totally proud,' she said. In 2003 she smashed the marathon world record as she won in London . In 2003 her form on the roads continued as she set also world records over 5k and 10k . But at the 2004 Athens Olympics, she was forced to drop out of the race despite being favourite to win . Paula was devastated she couldn't finish the Olympic marathon as her body was depleted by medication she had to take following a collision with a bike in training beforehand . The athlete felt she'd let everyone down and cried at the press conference . 'It makes you think we have to put a system in place that protects clean athletes. There will be some Russians athletes who are not cheating, there are a lot of Kenyan athletes out there who are not cheating and they are all being lumped together. It spoils it so we have to do something to protect them and the sport.' Paula bounced back from the disappointment in Edmonton to have a victorious year in 2002 over all terrain. She won the World Cross Country Championships and the London Marathon and finally took gold medals on the track at the Commonwealth Games and then the European Championships. She bounced back from the Olympic disappointment to take victory at the London Marathon again in 2005 . But the race will be remembered for the toilet stop she took en route . She also won a gold medal at the World Champs in 2005 over the marathon distance . Her popularity soared as she was awarded an MBE in June 2002 and later that year was voted the BBC's Sports Personality of the Year. In 2003 she ran her incredible world record marathon time pushing the pace from start to finish without another competitor in sight. She also set world records over 10k and 5k on the roads in the same year. As a result, in 2004 she went into the Athens Olympics marathon as the firm favourite and hopes were high that she would finally win the gold Olympic medal she deserved. But it was not to be. In training before the race, an collision with a cyclist led to an injury for which she had to take anti-inflammatory medication. The medicine depleted her system but she was determined to still race. However, her weakened body could not take the pace and she was forced to drop out of the race in tears. She later said the time that followed was 'traumatic' as she felt like she'd let the nation down and Gary admitted in ITV4's Sports Life Stories that the media attention almost led to him having 'a nervous breakdown'. The following year her success winning the London Marathon again was overshadowed by the fact she had to stop for a very public loo break on the side of the road. At the press conference afterwards, Paula laughed off the embarrassing incident explaining her need for the toilet was giving her stomach cramps and 'the main thing was to win the race'. Later that year, she won another gold medal in the World Championships over the marathon distance. Paula and Gary moved to Monaco and started a family as daughter Isla was born in January 2007. Less than a year later, Paula was back to winning ways taking victory at the New York Marathon. Daughter Isla was born in 2007 and months later, Paula won the New York marathon . But in 2008, she was disappointed to finish 23rd in the Beijing Olympics as her training was interrupted by injury in the build up. She's pictured here being consoled by friend and fellow GB runner Liz Yelling . Son Raphael was born in 2010 but injury again ruined her attempts to resume her running career . Once again she became an inspiration and proved to other elite female athletes that you can combine motherhood with a successful running career. In 2008, Paula lined up at the Olympics again but injury in the build-up to the race meant she missed vital training and she wasn't fit enough to compete with the best on the day. She finished in 23rd place and was once again upset she couldn't fulfill her potential at the Olympics. Later that year she won the New York marathon and then took another career break to have son Raphael. Since then, she returned to competitive running but was often thwarted by injury causing her to pull out of major competitions. In 2012, Paula had surgery on a long-standing foot problem in the hope it would mean she could run again . The surgery worked and Paula will now return to run the streets of London this weekend . The athlete said she's delighted to be back in the capital and Sunday's race will be 'really special' A foot problem meant running in the London 2012 Olympics was out of the question - in fact doctors were worried she may never run again. She kept up her interest in athletics becoming a commentator for the BBC and supporting grassroots running. Following surgery in 2012, she was relieved to be able to run again and is delighted she can now run the London Marathon again, albeit not at full fitness. She said of Sunday's race: 'I know I am not going to be competitive but to get the chance to take part in this race one more time is something that is really special.'",41-year-old mother-of-two has battled back from injury .

"For a player known for his fearsome, fire-breathing nature in the centre of Arsenal’s midfield, who would protect goal like it was a pot of gold, it is fitting that he is preparing to be a football manager at Dragon Park. Patrick Vieira is set to complete his UEFA Pro Licence this summer leaving Manchester City’s Head of the Elite Development equipped for the top job. He has been taking his coaching badges with the Welsh Football Association under their technical director Osian Roberts. Given Manuel Pellegrini’s capitulation at City, the timing of their conclusion could not be better with Vieira itching for a chance to test himself amongst the best. Patrick Vieira has been part of the coaching team at Manchester City since he retired . Vieira worked as Football Development Executive at City before becoming reserve team manager . Vieira is one of the potential candidates in the frame to replace Manuel Pellegrini - if he were to leave . Under Premier League rules, there is nothing stopping Vieira taking charge now as they allow coaches without the full qualifications to take charge for 12 weeks. There is currently no real hurry, but in the coming months City’s top echelons will have some important decisions to make. Vieira’s contract at City is due to expire this summer and he is not prepared to hang around forever waiting for a chance at the helm. City’s teenagers are in awe of the man, having grown up watching him torment the Premier League for a decade at Arsenal and City and across Europe. Vieira played for Manchester City towards the end of his career after spells at Juventus and Inter Milan . Vieira was signed by former manager Roberto Mancini in 2011 . One of their brightest prospects on loan at Lille, Rony Lopes, told Sportsmail in an interview: ’It was like a dream just to meet someone like Vieira. For him to be the coach, it was the best thing in the world. From the first day, he was always very friendly, talking to me a lot, trying to pass on his knowledge and make me grow up as a player and a person. That was he wanted. He is very important to me. He keeps in touch with me, asking how I am.’ After a poor start to his time in charge of City’s young players they have made it to the UEFA Youth League quarter-finals for two successive seasons, enhancing Vieira’s reputation. Young Portuguese player Rony Lopes spoke highly of Vieira . The Frenchman also has allies in the first team, having played with Vincent Kompany and Joe Hart in his one season at the club in 2010/11. When Vieira joined City in a coaching capacity in June 2013 his aim was to see how he progressed in ‘the next few years,’ suggesting he is coming to a decision-making juncture in his career. He chose the Welsh FA and Roberts, who works alongside his deputy Carl Darlington, to complete his badges because the pair are known for developing individual coaches through their personality. Vieira is best remembered for the nine years he spent at Arsenal . Vieira made his name in England at Arsenal where he won seven major honours . Vieira has his own idea of how he wants to manage a side. ‘My coaching style is a combination from my experience of working with Arsene Wenger, Fabio Capello and Jose Mourinho,’ he told Sportsmail in an interview. ‘There is a little bit of all of them, plus my own experience to deliver my message. The relationship with the players is so important. I want to trust them but they must trust me, too. I like it because I want to be close with them. ‘ . In February he added another stellar manager to his list of influences when he spent time at Bayern Munich with Pep Guardiola and his backroom staff. City’s academy director Mark Allen described how he likes his sides to play: ‘We play out from the back, through the thirds, into midfield and then a possession-based game but with fast, attacking play. We want to keep the ball, have full-backs bombing on and work on a very fast recovery. Press, press, press and play again.'",Patrick Vieira set to complete his UEFA Pro Licence this summer .

"A shrine created in memory of those killed during the Germanwings crash has revealed the first picture of the hero pilot who tried to break into the plane’s cockpit. Staring straight ahead, eyes firmly on the camera, this is the only photograph to have emerged of Patrick Sonderheimer, the pilot of the doomed flight. Yet the shrine, which was erected in memory of the staff killed during the tragedy, controversially also includes a picture of co-pilot Andreas Lubitz. Scroll down for video . A memorial display at Dusseldorf airport has revealed the first photograph of hero captain Patrick Sondheimer left) who tried to break down the cockpit door to stop killer pilot Andreas Lubitz (second from left) from crashing the aircraft . Mr Lubitz is the man who orchestrated the disaster by steering flight 9525, from Barcelona to Dusseldorf, into the mountains killing all of those on board. It has since emerged that Mr Lubitz had carefully planned the attack using the online pseudonym ‘Skydevil’, according to the German newspaper Bild. As the plane plummeted towards ground, Mr Sondheimer, 36, a father-of-two, tried in vain to save the lives of the 144 passengers and five crew members on board. Moments before, he had left the cockpit in the hands of his co-pilot in order to use the bathroom. When he returned, the door was locked and co-pilot Lubitz, 27, ignored desperate pleas from his colleague to let him back in. In a desperate attempt to stop the fatal crash, Mr Sondheimer spent up to five minutes attempting to smash his way into the cockpit using an axe. Mr Sondheimer used an axe to try to break down the door to the cockpit after Lubitz (right) locked him out before accelerating into a mountain . All of the 144 passengers and five crew members died in the crash. Lubitz, 27, had been plotting the disaster online under the name Skydevil . On recordings retrieved from the plane’s black box Mr Sondheimer can be heard shouting: ‘Open the goddam door’ in the moments before his death. The display in memory of the staff who died was created before it was revealed that Mr Lubitz had intentionally crashed the plane in the French Alps on March 24. Alongside the two men, sit the photographs of the other four crew members killed during the tragedy. All four are seen smiling broadly at the camera. The picture was taken at Dusseldorf airport, according to German newspaper Bild am Sonntag. Last night, Mr Sondheimer’s heartbroken mother paid tribute to her ‘hero’ son at her home 15 miles from the German town of Dusseldorf. Mrs Sondheimer said: ‘He died a hero but he still died, and we are devastated. The light has gone out of our lives. I am too upset to say any more.’ Shortly before the crash, Mr Sondheimer, the father of a six-year-old girl and a three-year-old boy, had switched from long-haul to short-haul flights in order to spend more time with his young family. During a memorial on March 29, his grandmother Marianne Sondheimer said her grandson’s lifelong dream was to become a pilot. She said: ‘My grandson is dead and all because of an idiot who did this to his whole flight and killed so many people.’ During the service, Captain Sondheimer was described as a man who ‘radiated happiness’. Black box recordings revealed Mr Sondheimer frantically appealed to Lubitz to open the door as the plane plunged further towards a mountain. He was described as a hero by his family .",Mr Sondheimer frantically tried to break down cockpit door before crash . Photograph of the captain is the first to have been released since disaster .

"Kingsley Burrell, 29, died in police custody on March 31 2011, four days after he was arrested and sectioned in Birmingham city centre . A mentally ill father-of-three who died in police custody was handcuffed for six hours, wet himself after being denied access to a toilet, and was repeatedly punched by officers, it was claimed today. Kingsley Burrell, 29, was taken into custody on March 27 2011 after calling police to say he was being threatened with a gun while out shopping in the centre of Birmingham, a court has heard. However, when CCTV showed that in fact nobody had approached him, he was sectioned under the Mental Health Act, and died four days later at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital (QE). An inquest into his death at Birmingham Coroner's Court heard that he was arrested in the Haymer corner shop in Winson Green while he was going swimming with his son, four, and niece. Trainee security guard Mr Burrell called police himself, saying two men had threatened to shoot him, but when they arrived he was handcuffed and taken to the QE hospital. Today, Kadisha Brown-Burrell, the victim's sister, described the moment she saw Mr Burrell following his arrest. She said: 'When he walked out he walked over stiff. He couldn’t move his head, couldn’t move his body, couldn’t move his shoulders. 'Kingsley had three lumps, one on his forehead. I said to Chantelle, ""Take a picture of that"". 'Kingsley said to me, ""I can’t move"". He couldn’t move the upper part of his body. He was barefoot and had pyjama bottoms on. 'I could see that he was really upset, saying, ""How can they put me in here knowing I was calling for help because there were a couple of guys after me?""' When she and Mr Burrell's partner Chantelle Graham returned to see him the following day, he told them he had been handcuffed for a number of hours after being taken to the hospital. Ms Brown-Burrell said: 'He said that while he was in the QE during assessment he was on the floor, and all he wanted was a glass of water. Mr Burrell was taken into custody after calling officers and claiming three men had threatened him with a machine gun. When CCTV showed that nobody had approached Mr Burrell, he was sectioned . Today an inquest into Mr Burrell's death was told his claims that police beat him, and left him handcuffed for six hours  pictured left to right, his family Janet Burrell, Lorraine Burell and Kadisha Burrell) 'They had made him incontinent and he had wet himself. He was on the floor for five or six hours and all he wanted was water and for them to release the cuffs.' Mr Burrell told her a police officer had offered to loosen the cuffs for him, but 'instead he tightened them', she told the court. Mr Burrell also told her he had been involved in a struggle in the back of the ambulance, and that three members of hospital staff had watched while police officers 'injected me into my brain'. She said: 'When I went to see Kingsley he said the police gave him injections into the top of his head, while three mental health staff looked through a window.' Ms Brown-Burrell described her brother, as 'calm, collected and outgoing', but said that he had been worried about a paternity issue with an ex-girlfriend. The woman, Charmaine Clarke, had been claiming that her son was not Mr Burrell's, and had named the child after another man. The inquest heard that Mr Burrell had been trying to get his former partner to take a DNA test to confirm whether he was the father. Mr Burrell believed that the two men had come into the shop to threaten him over the issue, adding that the only reason he wasn't shot was because he had his son with him . Mr Burrell's sister Kadisha (front right) also told the inquest her brother's allegations that police had left him without access to a toilet so he had wet himself . Among Mr Burrell's other allegations, related to the court by his sister and former partner, were that police had kept him in uncomfortably tight handcuffs, and had injected him three times in the head . In a 999 call played to the jury Mr Burrell repeatedly said that 'two black youths and one Asian' put a 'Mach 10' machine gun to his head, and were waiting for him outside the shop. Mr Burrell also claimed that one of the men was the leader of the Burger Bar Crew, a notorious Birmingham gang. But CCTV footage played to the court showed no sign of armed men in the shop. Instead all it showed was Mr Brown looking agitated and gesticulating wildly near the counter. Andy Gillespie, a firefighter who was one of the first on the scene, said Mr Burrell was 'very distressed', struggled to make eye contact was gesticulating and animated while on the phone. In a previous statement Mr Gillespie said that when he approached Mr Burrell he told him he was a 'f****** dead man', adding: 'Two people are trying to kill me. I will be dead in 24 hours.' He said Mr Burrell told him: 'I want everyone here for protection, I am a dead man. Somebody put a gun to my head, there is guys down the road, I am a dead man.' Footage showed Mr Burrell repeatedly pressing his hands together in prayer, and Mr Gillespie said he was saying: 'Praise God, praise Allah'. He said: 'It was almost that he felt relieved that he hadn't been shot.' Kadisha Brown-Burrell (pictured) said that on the first day she went to visit her brother in hospital, after he was arrested, he was 'walking stiff' and couldn't move the upper part of his body . Mr Burrell's partner, Chantelle Graham, said her son, who was with Mr Burrell as he was arrested, repeated 'the black police officer hit my daddy' after she took him home . Ms Graham told the inquest that when she went to pick up her son from a police station an officer told her Mr Burrell had 'gone berserk' in the ambulance . The officer alleged that Mr Burrell had banged his son's head against the wall and that he had to be restrained in order to get the boy away from him. But her son told her a black police officer had started hitting Mr Burrell, the court heard. Ms Graham said: 'Kayden just kept saying, ""The black police officer hit my daddy"" to anyone who would listen. That is what he told everyone, even at school.' Ms Brown-Burrell also said that in the days after Mr Burrell's death, Kayden had said, 'The naughty black policeman did that to daddy.' The inquest also heard that Mr Burrell had been carrying a CS canister on the day he was detained, as well as claims that he was a gang member and drug dealer. The inquest continues tomorrow and is expected to last six weeks.

"When Hillary Clinton steps off her road-trip van on Tuesday at a rural Iowa community college, she might not be greeted by cheering throngs. Daily Mail Online spoke to students at Kirkwood Community College's regional center in Jones County, where the former secretary of state will hold her first low-key campaign event. The outlook isn't sunny for the kickoff of her 'listening tour': Of the ten students interviewed in the school's public lounge, only two would speak kindly of Mrs. Clinton. 'She's going to push some emotional thing on us,' predicted student Hallie Corum in between classes. 'What else is she supposed to do?' 'She's going to be, like, talking s**t.' 'TALKING S**T': Hillary Clinton launched her presidential campaign on Sunday and hit the road in a van, en route to a skeptical bunch of community college students in Monticello, Iowa . Corey Jones said he suspects that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama want immigration reform because it would result in a new generation of grateful Democratic voters – and he plans to ask her about it on Tuesday . Kirkwood Community College's outpost in rural Monticello serves hundreds of students, including some who are still high school juniors and seniors . Corum declined to be photographed, flashing an impish grin. Corey Jones, a graphic design student, is among those chosen to question Mrs. Clinton in a roundtable setting on Tuesday. He said his teachers chose him to join a group of 'from 6 to 8' students whowill participate because 'I pay attention to politics,' something his friends around a table agreed with. 'I didn't know Hillary Clinton was running,' one young woman said. 'Is she running? Go ask Corey. He's up on all that stuff.' Jones said he plans to ask Hillary about illegal immigration. 'It's – well, Immigration reform,' he told Daily Mail Online. 'You know, Obama's plan was to make the illegal immigrants legal.' 'She's part of all that. And some people think – well, I think maybe – it's just a tactic to have more Democratic votes' from millions of grateful new citizens. Jones, like Corum, will vote in his first presidential election next year. He said Clinton is holding her first campaign event at a community college 'because she's trying to appeal to youth, to young voters.' 'She announced it on YouTube. That's targeted at people my age, right?' Clinton set off on a 1,000-mile road trip Sunday in her home town of Chappaqua, New York, and headed to Iowa – where the nation's first primary caucuses will start the machinery that chooses major parties' presidential candidate. She announced Sunday afternoon that she was officially in the race. A female student who declined to be named speculated about Clinton's motives for taking ground transportation instead of a jet aircraft. 'Can you imagine if she stepped off a private jet in Des Moines or Iowa City and walked down a set of steps in realy expensive shoes and a thousand-dollar outfit?' she asked. 'That would be, um, a really bad idea. I like the van better. Is it a minivan? God, I hope it's not a minivan.' Future chef Ross Vander Peut said gay marriage is a 'deal-breaker' for him but worries that Hillary Clinton 'seems like, kinda like a control freak' Monticello, Iowa is a sleepy farm town whose main street is lined with shops sporting signs that look like relics from the mid-twentieth century . Most students in Monday's random sample chose not to talk about Mrs. Clinton. All of the will be old enough to vote next year for the first time in their lives. Three said they didn't have an opinion about the Democratic front-runner. One looked up, shook her head, and put a pair of earbuds on. Two more said they would rather remain silent. 'You know, it's that ""If you don't have something nice to say, don't say anything at all"" deal,' a young woman offered from behind her tablet computer. Moments later a group of young men walked down a hallway mimicking Bill Clinton's infamous 'I did not have sexual relations with that woman' press conference – and laughing uproariously. One who would talk is Bri Parks, a speech and psychology student who wants to be an FBI profiler because she likes 'trying to figure out how the human brain works.' Clinton can work to earn her vote, Parks said. 'If I heard her opinions and liked her ideas, I would support her.' But 'I hope people don't vote for her just because she's a woman.' Asked for the nicest thing she could say about Mrs. Clinton, Parks said 'she's not going at this saying, ""Look, I'm a woman, so vote for me."" She's not using her sex to prove a point.' 'She's looking at herself as a politician, not as a woman.' Students like these gathered in a Kirkwood Community College lounge and spoke with Daily Mail Online before and after classes on Monday . Bri Parks, a Kirkwood Community College student, said she hopes Americans don't vote for Hillary Clinton 'just because she's a woman' 'I don't think we should be putting people in extremely high political positions because of race, sex, or whatever,' Parks explained. 'Then you're doing things just because of what people look like.' Kirkwood serves between 22,000 and 26,000 students taking college-credit courses at sites in seven Iowa counties, according to a school official. The Monticello outpost is canceling many classes on Tuesday, making some students scratch their heads since 'this is the smallest part of Kirkwood,' as one pointed out. 'They could have had it somewhere else.' As it is, Kirkwood's students who do have class will have to dodge Secret Service agents and TV news cameras to get through the lobby. Some of them are recent high school graduates while others are finishing their 11th- and 12th-grade years collecting college credits one day per week. Ross Vander Peut, a self-described future chef, is one of the youngest. He's 16, a high-school junior, but will turn 18 just before the election. Vander Peut described himself as a libertarian – 'I like government to leave me alone,' he said – and gay marriage is 'a deal-breaker.' 'Equal rights, homosexual rights, it's one thing I will not sway on,' he told Daily Mail Online. 'If you are against gay marriage, you've lost my vote. There's nothing you can do to change it.' He hedged on Hillary, saying she 'seems like, kinda like a control freak.' 'But she also seems very strong-willed and determined. When she wants something done she probably does it herself.'","Daily Mail Online spoke to ten students at Kirkwood Community College's satellite campus in rural Iowa where Hillary Clinton will be Tuesday . One student is among those picked by teachers to question the former secretary of state . He wants her to comment on his suspicion about immigration reform – that Democrats are pushing the policy because they need new loyal voters .

"(CNN)A fiery sunset greeted people in Washington Sunday. The deep reddish color caught Seattle native Tim Durkan's eye. He photographed a handful of aerial shots of the sunset warming the city's skyline and shared them on CNN iReport. The stunning sunsets were the result of raging wildfires in parts of Siberia. ""The dramatic sunsets began showing up over the weekend and had Seattle locals wondering where the amber-colored haze was originating from,"" Durken said. The fires were started in southeastern Siberia, by farmers burning grass in their fields. But on April 14, it is believed that the flames quickly grew out of control because of strong winds and spread throughout the region, according to CNN affiliate KOMO-TV. As a result, the fires have destroyed dozens of villages in the region. Rescue crews were able to put out the flames. However, the lingering smoke from the widespread fires were picked up by atmospheric winds. The winds carried the smoke from Siberia across the Pacific Ocean and brought it to the Pacific Northwest. Parts of Oregon, Washington and British Columbia are seeing the results of the smoke, wind and solar light combination. The reason people are seeing an intense red sunset is a result of smoke particles filtering out the shorter wavelength colors from the sunlight like greens, blues, yellows and purples, KOMO-TV said. That means colors like red and orange are able to penetrate the air unfiltered. The colors are especially intense during sunrises and sunsets because there is more atmosphere for the light to travel through to get to a person's eye. As the smoke starts to dissipate, air quality will get better and these fiery sunsets will lose their reddish hue.","Smoke from massive fires in Siberia created fiery sunsets in the Pacific Northwest .

"(The Hollywood Reporter)Richard Dysart, the Emmy-winning actor who portrayed the cranky senior partner Leland McKenzie in the slick, long-running NBC drama ""L.A. Law,"" has died. He was 86. Dysart, who also played Coach in the original 1972 Broadway production of Jason Miller's Pulitzer Prize-winning ""That Championship Season,"" died Sunday at home in Santa Monica after a long illness, his wife, artist Kathryn Jacobi, told The Hollywood Reporter. The acclaimed ""L.A. Law"" — created by Steven Bochco (who eventually handed off the series to David E. Kelley) and Terry Louise Fisher — aired for eight seasons from 1986 to 1994. For playing the founder of the firm McKenzie, Brackman, Chaney and Kuzak, Dysart was nominated for the Emmy for outstanding supporting actor in a drama series for four straight years, finally winning the trophy in 1992. ""I always had him in mind for that role,"" Bochco said in a 2002 interview with the Archive of American Television. ""He's so avuncular. So I reached out to him. You know, Dick is sort of an old hippie. So he went into his closet and tried to find a lawyer outfit, and he came to meet us wearing a suit and tie. He was perfect."" ""We got together, mapped out the character's past to give us a basis from which to work, and it's all gone smoothly since then,"" Dysart said in a 1990 interview with The Seattle Times. ""Sometimes I worry — it's all been going too well — a role I love to play in a series that's about as good as you can get. Something's wrong!"" Perhaps Dysart's most memorable character arc on the show was when he was found in bed with power-hungry competitor Rosalind Shays (played by Diana Muldaur). He was one of the few actors to appear in every episode. Dysart's range of authority -figure parts ran right to the top. He limned Harry Truman in the CBS telefilm ""Day One"" and in the ABC miniseries ""War and Remembrance,"" both of which aired in 1989, and he was Henry L. Stimson, the 33rd U.S. president's Secretary of War, in the 1995 HBO telefilm ""Truman,"" starring Gary Sinise. Similarly, he played the Secretary of Defense in ""Meteor"" (1979). Hollywood Reporter: Most powerful people in N.Y. media . Dysart also performed extensively in the medical- (movie) field, performing enough doctor roles to, perhaps, qualify to practice. His two most memorable came in classic satires: in Paddy Chayevsky's scathing ""The Hospital"" (1971), starring George C. Scott (a good friend), and in ""Being There"" (1979), as Melvyn Douglas' doctor. He also was a doctor who died a gruesome death in John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" (1982) and a physician in such films as ""The Terminal Man"" (1974), ""The Falcon and the Snowman"" (1985) and ""Warning Sign"" (1985). Dysart portrayed J. Edgar Hoover in the 1993 USA telefilm ""Marilyn & Bobby: Her Final Affair"" and in Mario Van Peebles' ""Panther"" (1995). Dysart also excelled as cranky coots and shifty sorts. He portrayed a motel receptionist in Richard Lester's ""Petulia"" (1968); was the bad guy who battled Clint Eastwood in ""Pale Rider"" (1985); stood out as a power player in Oliver Stone's ""Wall Street"" (1987); and sold barbwire in ""Back to the Future III"" (1990). Dysart was born March 30, 1929, in Boston and raised in Maine. Following high school, he attended the Gould Academy in Bethel, Maine, for a year, served in the U.S. Air Force and attended Emerson College, where he graduated with a master's degree in speech communications. At the time, he was interested in a career in radio (he became fascinated with the medium in first grade, when he was bedridden for a year because of rheumatic fever) but was soon tempted by acting. He moved to New York on a whim and was able to land minor roles on TV and a part in an off-Broadway production of ""The Iceman Cometh"" opposite Jason Robards. In the mid-1960s, he joined the American Conservatory Theater and toured the country doing plays, then landed roles on Broadway in ""All in Good Time,"" ""The Little Foxes"" and ""A Place Without Doors."" He received a Drama Desk Award for his performance in ""That Championship Season."" Hollywood Reporter: Q&A with Liz Smith . Dysart's credits include an eclectic array of movies, including ""The Crazy World of Julius Vrooder"" (1974), ""The Day of the Locust"" (1975), ""The Hindenburg"" (1975), ""An Enemy of the People"" (1978), ""Prophecy"" (1979), ""Mask"" (1985) and ""Hard Rain"" (1998). On television, he was top-notch in the telefilms ""The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman"" (1974), ""The People vs. Jean Harris"" (1981), as Dwight D. Eisenhower in ""The Last Days of Patton"" (1986) and as studio chief Louis B. Mayer in ""Malice in Wonderland"" (1985). Survivors also include his stepson Arie and daughter-in-law Jeannine Jacobi, mother-in-law Lenore, brother and sister-in-law Nadine and John Jacobi and grandchildren Abby and Levi. A private memorial is being planned. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations be made to the Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum, an outdoor theater in Topanga Canyon in the Los Angeles area. Dysart and Jacobi had a second home in the forests of British Columbia. He was lured out of retirement for his last onscreen appearance, the ""L.A. Law"" reunion telefilm of 2002. ""They remain timely, with cases about points of law that are still current,"" he said of watching ""L.A. Law"" reruns in a 2002 interview with The Bangor Daily News.

"This gruesome video shows how a man popped a huge cyst in his arm with a needle, screwdriver and a pair of pliers. The man, known only as Jason, from Vancouver, uploaded the clip to YouTube after his wife filmed the stomach-churning moment. It begins with him explaining exactly how he will pop the grape-sized growth on his wrist. He says: 'We have the pliers, they're going to hold onto the needle which will then be smashed into my cyst with the end of a screwdriver. 'It should be pretty cool.' The man, known only as Jason, uploaded the video to YouTube of his unique way of popping a cyst - using a needle, a pair of pliers and a screwdriver. Pictured is his sister in law putting the needle into the swelling . As Jason's sister in law hammers the needle deeper into the cyst with the handle of a screwdriver, he emits loud cries of pain . First, he lays his left arm down on some kitchen roll on a table so the lump is easily accessible. His sister-in-law then inserts the needle into the cyst and holds it in place with a pair of pliers as he winces. She then begins the horrifying process of hammering the needle deeper into the growth. Sharp cries of pain are heard from Jason with each hit. Astonishingly, though the process seems too agonising to bear, Jason says: 'I think we can go a little deeper'. After one last hammer – which was once again met with a loud moan – he says: 'It's in there pretty good. Now we've got to pull it out. Dr Arun Ghosh, a private GP in Liverpool, condemned Jason's method of popping his cyst with a needle, pliers and a screwdriver. He told MailOnline: 'We advise not draining minor ganglions. 'They just get bigger and bigger. We only drain it if they are very large and hindering the use of the hand. 'It’s wrong to pop a ganglion with a needle and a screwdriver on so many levels. Traditionally, ganglions would be 'bashed with the family bible', but doctors do not advise this . 'From a hygiene point of view you’ve got to sterilise your equipment. We would never insert a needle that would be used in the house. They are covered in millions of bacteria. 'You can never control the force by using a screwdriver, and that’s dangerous. 'There are very fine arteries and nerves in the hand, and they’re so easy to damage. 'If they are damaged you get irreversible pain. If you think how often you use your hand that can be debilitating. 'There used to be a myth that you should bash a ganglion with a family bible to burst it. 'That’s caused problems with the fluid going into the wrist joint, causing carpel tunnel syndrome: swelling inside the wrist. 'If we did treat it, we’d do a needle aspiration, which means sucking out the glue-like pus. 'But that would be what is known as ""aseptic"", meaning the pus would be drawn out into the syringe and would never touch the wound, to prevent infection. 'We would also do it under ultrasound so as not to damage the fine veins and arteries in the hand. 'If you have a ganglion or a swelling you must go to your GP and they will advise whether its OK or whether it’s best to be left alone. 'Then it will be followed up and receive proper after care.' 'I'm going to see if we can get the fluid squirting out if it does.' Moments later, he takes the needle out and asks the camera to zoom in on his arm. As he squeezes the cyst, sticky, translucent jelly comes rushing out and gathers in a pea-sized ball. 'Let's see what the consistency looks like,' he said as he rubs the gluey substance between two fingers. He adds: 'This is probably the grossest thing I've ever seen – since the last time I've done this. 'This will probably do the trick for three or so months until I have to pop it again.' Uploading the video to YouTube under the name 'The Wrist Cyst', he promises to upload another video in another three months time when he pops the cyst again. Unsurprisingly, medical professionals do not advise using Jason's method to treat lumps found on the body. Dr Arun Ghosh, a private GP in Liverpool, explains that Jason's cyst is a ganglion, a fluid-filled swelling that develops near a joint or a tendon. They are made up of a thick jelly-like fluid called synovial fluid, which surrounds joints and tendons to lubricate them during movement - and occur when this fluid leaks out and collects under the skin. Ganglions can occur alongside any joint in the body, but are most commonly found on the wrist, hand and fingers. Generally harmless, if they do not cause any pain, they can be left alone and will disappear without any treatment. Dr Ghosh said: 'We advise not draining minor ganglions. They just get bigger and bigger. We only drain it if they are very large and hindering the use of the hand. 'A ganglion is a fluid-filled sack. If you start the drainage process, the bigger and bigger the sack will fill. 'This is the issue this gentleman has caused, he’ll need to drain it more often.' Traditionally, ganglions were treated by being 'bashed with the family Bible', but this is no longer recommended, as this could cause the fluid to disperse and cause carpel tunnel syndrome - a swelling in the wrist - he added. Dr Ghosh added Jason's method was also not advisable either. He told MailOnline: 'It’s wrong to pop a ganglion with a needle and a screwdriver on so many levels. It’s unhygienic, you can’t control the force and you could damage the nerves in the hand. 'From a hygiene point of view you’ve got to sterilise your equipment. We would never insert a needle that would be used in the house. They are covered in millions of bacteria. 'You can never control the force by using a screwdriver, and that’s dangerous. 'There are very fine arteries and nerves in the hand, and they’re so easy to damage. If they are damaged you get irreversible pain. If you think how often you use your hand that can be debilitating.' He removes the needle and squeezes the cyst, and a ball of sticky, see-through jelly-like fluid emerges . Jason rubs his fingers together to show the sticky consistency of the fluid that comes out of the growth, which doctors explain is synovial fluid, which surrounds joints and tendons to lubricate them . At the end of the video, Jason says the cyst will need draining again in three months. But doctors strongly advise against his method - and say ganglions do not normally require treatment . If the cyst needs treatment, the fluid should be drained out with a needle and syringe by a doctor, or cut out in a surgical procedure. Dr Ghosh added: 'If we did treat it, we’d do a needle aspiration, which means sucking out the glue-like pus. 'But that would be what is known as ""aseptic"", meaning the pus would be drawn out into the syringe and would never touch the wound, to prevent infection. 'We would also do it under ultrasound so as not to damage the fine veins and arteries in the hand. 'If you have a ganglion or a swelling you must go to your GP and they will advise whether its OK or whether it’s best to be left alone.

"Manchester City have decided to listen to offers for Yaya Toure and Samir Nasri this summer as the Barclays Premier League champions look to repair the damage of a disastrous title defence. City manager Manuel Pellegrini is under intense scrutiny following Sunday’s 4-2 defeat by neighbours Manchester United. But as the City board refuse to give up on their manager just yet the decision has been made to jettison high-profile players who the club believe have failed them. Manchester City have decided to listen to offers for Ivorian midfielder Yaya Toure this summer . The Premier League champions are also open to allowing Samir Nasri leave the Etihad Stadium . Toure will be made available before his value in the market dwindles. Nasri, meanwhile, has barely played since his lame showing in the Champions League at Barcelona. Defender Aleksandar Kolarov and striker Edin Dzeko are also short of admirers within the club, while midfielder James Milner is out of contract this summer. Toure may be difficult to sell as he earns in excess of £1million a month. Pellegrini is vulnerable but may be saved by a relatively undemanding fixture list up to the end of the season and by the fact that City’s No 1 choice to replace him, Pep Guardiola, is contracted to Bayern Munich for another year. However, City fear captain Vincent Kompany will miss a few weeks of the run-in with a thigh injury.",Manchester City were beaten 4-2 by their rivals United at Old Trafford .

"Two former police officials who quit their jobs in Parma, Missouri, have revealed what they say are the real reasons they stepped down. A black woman, Tyus Byrd,  was recently elected mayor of the town over the white incumbent candidate Randall Ramsey, MailOnline reported earlier this week. Six city officials quit their jobs shortly after Byrd won, according to multiple reports. Two of those individuals - Trish Cohen, Parma's former police chief, and Rich Medley, the town's former assistant police chief - recently spoke to NBC News. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Trish Cohen, Parma's former police chief, and Rich Medley, the town's former assistant police chief,  quit their jobs with the city. Tyus Byrd, who is black, was recently elected mayor. Cohen has said she and Medley feared for their safety, and their home addresses had been shared online by Byrd's family members . Cohen alleged in the interview with the news outlet that she and Medley feared for their safety, and said their home addresses had been shared online by Byrd's family members. Referring to Byrd, Cohen told NBC News 'You can't have an anti-police mayor, and that's the way she made me feel.' 'My decision was not, did not, come lightly. At all,' Cohen also said. 'It has nothing to do with race. If it had anything to do with race, I'd done never went to work in the town.' Medley told NBC News 'From the moment [Byrd] announced her candidacy, she never approached any of us, never advised us what her plans were or anything. Never asked us to stay or told us that the moment she took office that we weren't going to have a job. 'We were in the dark on it, and then in hearing from her supporters that she was going to fire all of us, might as well start looking for something else.' Mayor: Tyus Byrd, pictured, has said she doesn't know what the 'safety issues' were and that she 'never said anything about cleaning house' Six city officials quit their jobs shortly after Byrd was elected to serve as Parma's mayor . Byrd, meanwhile, told NBC News she did not know the reason the city employees quit. She also told the news outlet she did not believe race played a role. In an interview with the media outlet, Byrd said 'It was cited to me that it was safety issues. I would love to know what those safety issues are. 'I wish we could have sat down and came to whatever the reasons were, that maybe we could have came to some type of agreement and understanding.' Speaking to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Byrd said 'I don’t understand. I never said anything about cleaning house.' The newspaper reported that while speaking to the Post-Dispatch, 'Medley acknowledged that Byrd had never threatened to fire officers, nor publicly indicated that she would interfere with police.' Medley told Daily Mail Online on Thursday, referring to the remarks Byrd earlier made to NBC News about wanting to have discussed issues together, 'She never made any attempts to talk with us during her candidacy or after winning the election. It's very hard to believe someone truly wanted to work with the police department in regards to their concerns when no effort is made. 'Add to that the information we were receiving from her supporters about firing us when she took office. It's not hard to understand that we did not believe we would have jobs after April 14th at 5p.m.' Cohen did not respond to a message seeking comment on social media Wednesday, and on Thursday her Facebook page appeared to have been taken down. Byrd did not respond to a request for comment on social media Wednesday, and did not immediately return requests on Thursday.

Many gays and lesbians point to Clinton's 2011 speech in Switzerland as Secretary of State in which she declared: 'Human rights are gay rights and gay rights are human rights.' In the video released yesterday announcing Clinton's candidacy for president, two gay couples were included. Among them, two lesbians who look lovingly into each other's eyes. However, in her 2008 campaign, Clinton did not support gay marriage. It took her five years - to publicly say that she supported gay marriage. President Barack Obama publicly announced his support for gay marriage nearly a year earlier in March 2012. The Economist called Clinton's stance on gay marriage, 'cautious to the point of cowardice.' 'It is not convincing to argue, as her supporters do, that she is only free to make her views known now that she has stepped down as America's chief diplomat. Her successor at the State Department, John Kerry, and has not been stoned as a blasphemer on any of his stops around the world to date,' the magazine's US columnist wrote. Critics also point out that as First Lady, she did not oppose her husband signing 'Don't Ask Don't Tell,' which banned being openly gay in the military or the Defense of Marriage Act, which banned gay marriage at the federal level.","LPAC, a pro-LGBT Super PAC, launched Lesbians4Hillary on Monday .

Bayern remain on course for three trophies, leading the Bundesliga by 12 points and will meet Borussia Dortmund in the German Cup semi-final. The Bavarians won the treble under then coach Jupp Heynckes in 2013, just before Guardiola took over. The current Bayern boss also won the treble with Barcelona in 2009, when they became the first Spanish club to win the domestic league and cup as well as the Champions League in the same season. Ahead of the visit of Porto, Guardiola said on Monday that France winger Franck Ribery is highly unlikely to recover from an ankle injury in time to feature for Bayern. Ribery has been out for more than a month and Guardiola said it was more likely the player would miss the second leg of the quarter-final in Munich as the Germans look to recover from a stunning 3-1 defeat in Portugal last week. 'I do not think that Franck can play,' Guardiola told reporters. 'I will speak with the our doctor but my feeling is that he can't make it.' Guardiola's hopes of turning the tie around have been hampered by a string of injury absences, including to key players Arjen Robben, David Alaba, Javi Martinez and Medhi Benatia. Bastian Schweinsteiger is also fighting to get fit in time for the game and Guardiola said the Germany captain would train with the team late on Monday for the first time.

"A 33-year-old professional skydiver who has made more than 6,000 dives was killed during a dive in Florida on Wednesday, after her chute apparently collided with another mid-air. Jessica Edgeington, of Villa Rica, Georgia, was a skilled diver known for a type of high-speed sport called 'swooping', where divers speed down to land and sweep over buoys and other obstacles on the surface of a pond as competition. She died after plummeting to the ground at the Skydive DeLand in DeLand, Florida. It is the second death at the skydiving center this year, after Navy SEAL William Marston died after landing heavily in January. It is unclear what type of dive Edgeinton was maneuvering, but she appears to have run into a problem in the air. First responders arrived about 4.10pm and Edgeington was pronounced dead at the scene. Tragedy: Jessica Edgeington, 33, a professional skydiver, was killed in a dive on Wednesday in DeLand, Florida, after apparently colliding with another dive mid-air . Professional: Edgeington had made over 6,000 jumps and competed in a sport called 'swooping', where divers speed down to land and swoop over buoys and other obstacles on the surface of a pond as competition . Investigation: It is unclear what type of dive Edgeinton was maneuvering, but she appears to have run into a problem in the air, but the crash is under investigation . Scene: Edgeington was pronounced dead at DeLand Municipal Airport on Wednesday about 4.10pm . Local media reports say Edgeington collided with another diver, causing a problem with her parachute. However the crash is currently under investigation. According to The Tampa Bay Times,  'swoopers' like Edgeington jump from the plane at 5,000 feet and reach speeds of 90 miles per hour as they descend. The sport is about how the person can handle their parachute and make maneuvers, including turns and twists. Edgeington gave an interview with the Associated Press in May last year while competing for a spot on the U.S. Parachute Team. 'It's not necessarily scary to jump out of the plane anymore,' she said. Killed: Jessica Edgeington, seen here at a swooping course,  died Wednesday afternoon after flying out of Skydive DeLand in Florida on Wednesday . Edgeington continued in the interview: 'I get competition nerves when I'm at something like this. 'So that's probably the most nerve wracking thing, is getting ready to compete. 'Trying to perform and do your best. Hopefully not mess up.' On her Facebook page, Edgeington lists herself as a 'canopy coach' for PD Factory Team. Canopy coaches educate skydivers of every level, from beginners working on accuracy to advanced semi-pros and elite military personnel. Her page was inundated with messages from family, friends and colleagues following the tragedy on Wednesday. Crash: Jessica Edgeington, 33, of Villa Rica, Georgia, died Wednesday afternoon at Skydive DeLand . It is the second death at the the DeLand field this year. In January, William 'Blake' Marston, a Navy SEAL learning how to skydive, died after hitting the land too hard, according to My News 13. The field is at DeLand Municipal Airport. Tributes: Hundreds of tributes have flooded in for the skydiver, describing her as a 'wonderful soul' Two other men died in separate incidents at Skydive DeLand in 2013. That year, in the 3.2 million jumps that happened across the country, the United States Parachute Associated recorded a total of 24 fatal skydiving accidents. There are thousands of dives at Skydive Delandeach year. It is also the home of SkyDive University, a professional skydiving instruction and coaching organization.","Jessica Edgeington, 33, had made over 6,000 jumps .

"A New York woman has worn the same ensemble to work every day for three years. Matilda Kahl, an art director at Saatchi & Saatchi, wears the exact same ‘uniform’ – an outfit made up of black trousers, white shirt and a custom leather rosette – every single day because, as she explains to DailyMail.com: 'When at work, I want to be judged on my work and my work only.' In an article for Harper's Bazaar, Matilda explained that the unique sartorial idea came to her after a particularly stressful morning when, with 'a fairly important meeting on the horizon' she began trying on a variety outfits to no satisfaction. Scroll down for video . Empowering: Saatchi & Saatchi art director Matilda Kahl has got everyone talking about her everyday work 'uniform' 'I'm given complete freedom over what I wear to the office, but that still left me questioning each piece that I added or subtracted from my outfit,' she wrote. '[I kept thinking], ""Is this too formal? Is that too out there? Is this dress too short?"" I finally chose something I regretted as soon as I hit the subway platform.' Arriving at her meeting late, frazzled and wearing an inside-out sweater, while her male colleagues and new boss looked relaxed and at-ease, left her feeling frustrated and wondering why she'd bothered with the stress of it at all. 'I knew my male colleagues were taken seriously no matter what they wore - and I highly doubted they put in as much sartorial time and effort as I had,' she writes. 'But gender issues aside, I needed to come up with a solution to simplify this morning struggle.' Vowing to never let herself feel that way again, Matilda made the decision to make the same simple, easy wardrobe choices as many of her male colleagues did, wearing the same outfit each and every day, thereby eliminating the seemingly endless struggle to determine what to wear. Simple, yet effective: Matilda achieved her look by buying blouses in bulk and pairing them only with black trousers . She found her sartorial salvation in the form of 15 identical white silk blouses and several pairs of simple black trousers. For a 'personal touch' she added a custom-made leather rosette in homage to her mother, who used to love putting bows in her hair. She also throws on a black blazer for the chillier days. 'I’ve always thought black and white looks stylish, so it was a pretty easy decision on the color,' she explains to Daily Mail Online, adding that she took her time deciding on the exact designs. 'I finally fell for the white shirt for its diagonal button line and the cuts in the sleeves. 'New York gets really hot in the summer, so as an alternative to the 6 pants I bought 2 matte black skirts. Simple and sweet.' With her identical every day look, Matilda is following in the footsteps of many high-powered individuals, from Steve Jobs to Mark Zuckerberg - who says he owns 20 identical grey t-shirts for work. All tied up: Matilda tops off her look with a simple black leather bow, which she calls her 'personal touch' inspired by her mother's affinity for bows in her hair . But despite many people trying out the trend before her, Matilda admitted that she faced 'mixed reactions' to her new uniform idea from her co-workers. She was asked if she had lost a bet, joined a cult and some even assumed she was too destitute to afford other work clothing. But when confronted with endless questions about her new look, she shot back with: 'Have you ever set up a bill for online auto-pay? Did it feel good to have one less thing to deal with every month?' Many critics also wonder: why doesn't she just choose her outfit the night before? 'To me, that would only move the problem to another time of day, not really solving it,' she says. 'It would just make me go to bed later and lose valuable sleep. 'Nor would it solve the pressure of constantly feeling that I have to express my creative ability through my way of dressing, which is something I feel relieved from now with the uniform.' According to Matilda, the criticism has done nothing but reassure her of her choices. 'People have really put it to the test, and I’m happy to say the more questions I get the more sure I become of that I’m happy with my choice of wearing a uniform,' she explains. All in all, Matilda is immensely pleased with her decision, saying it has saved her huge amounts of money– and also removed a source of stress from her life completely. She also claims it has given her a new sense of control. Coming up to three years in her look, Matilda doesn't see herself stopping anytime soon - but insists that if the mood strikes her, she could go back to planning her daily wardrobe. 'I still feel like it does a good job for me so I see no reason for stopping wearing the uniform,' she says. 'But if I would wake up one day and feel like start spending time on picking out an outfit every morning, I’d no problem with giving it up. The uniform is here for me, I’m not here for the uniform.' She does however admit that she has had to re-stock her collection of white shirts - because the 15 that she bought originally have become so worn out that she is no longer able to wear them. 'They are all exactly the same and have been for almost three years, up until a week ago,' she added to Harper's Bazaar. 'The shirts had gotten worn out, others stained....So last weekend I spent two days on a rather intense hunt for a new hero shirt. I finally found it at Zara.'","Matilda Kahl, an art director at Saatchi & Saatchi, owns 15 of the same white shirt and several pairs of plain black trousers . She has just had to invest in 15 new shirts from Zara because the others are now too worn to wear but has no other plans to change her ‘uniform’",1d6607ea1c20193fb61a24a9fec9e58e6f2b631d
"A health expert has slammed parents for not taking vaccination seriously after 19 children attending a primary school in north Brisbane contracted the potentially deadly disease whooping cough. Kilcoy State School is working with Queensland Health after a whooping cough outbreak in the area, but parents have been urged to take vaccination more seriously there. The Sunshine Coast Daily reports that infectious diseases expert Professor Matthew Cooper, a professorial research fellow at the University of Queensland's Institute for Molecular Bioscience, attributed the outbreak to an anti-vaccination trend. Parents have been accused of not taking vaccination seriously after 19 children attending a primary school in north Brisbane contracted whooping cough . 'It's unfortunately just part of a growing trend that many people have decided not to immunise,' he said. 'We've seen this with other diseases that are more serious than pertussis but unfortunately the more people who choose not to immunise the more likely it is we'll get outbreaks.' Although immunisation rates in Queensland have dropped across most age groups there since 2010, in 2014 the Metro North region had the highest immunisation rate in the state. Kilcoy State School (pictured) in north Brisbane is working with Queensland Health after a whooping cough outbreak in the area . There are about 1200 cases of whooping cough every year in the Metro North area. This region covers the Brisbane River to past Caboolture. in total there have been 86 confirmed cases in 2015 - alarmingly 16 in the past week - compared to 113 last year. Statewide, 232 cases have been reported. Parents were urged to take children with any symptoms to their family doctor . Dr Cooper said it was essential to convince parents of the importance of vaccination. He said if vaccination rates continued to fall there could be an increase in unfortunate and preventable deaths.

"Ed Miliband's poor leadership has been mocked by a Labour candidate, who said it was like having 'a manager of a football team that you don't rate, but you still support the team'. Paul Gilbert even joked that he hoped his 'off-piste' comment would not 'find it's way back' to the Labour leadership, because he stands little hope of winning in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. He also blasted Labour's 'entirely unsatisfactory' policy on tuition fees and told voters at a university hustings: 'I don't like where we are.' Scroll down for video . Labour candidate Paul Gilbert mocked Ed Miliband and then joked that he hoped his 'off-piste' comment would not 'find it's way back' to the Labour leadership . Mr Miliband has faced repeated criticism and off-the-record briefing about his leadership among Labour ranks, but most have seen the sense of keeping quiet about their misgivings during the election campaign. But Mr Gilbert felt no such reservations as he appeared at a hustings event with four other candidates. The 52-year-old lawyer was asked for his comments on higher eduction funding by a member of the audience at the packed event at the University of Gloucestershire. He said: 'If I can go off-piste a little, as somebody who has a very realistic idea of what the maths will be in this constituency, maybe what I say isn't going to find it's way back to Mr Miliband and his friends.' He added: 'Now one of the things which has brought me to politics at this very late stage you might think is the wish to make a difference. Now I am a Labour man and I will stand by my party, thick and thin. 'It's a bit like having a manager of a football team that you don't rate, but you still support the team, sometimes. 'What we have to do is work out how we can make the difference best, and from my point of view you're better on the inside making a difference than being on the outside grumbling about it.' To laughter from the audience, he was mocked by one of his fellow candidates for his 'glowing endorsement' for Labour's leader. Ed Miliband, pictured giving a speech in Stockton-on-Tees today, has promised to cut tuition fees from up to £9,000 to £6,000 if he is elected on May 7 . Ed Miliband has revealed his childhood dream was to become a London bus conductor. The Labour leader said a fascination with the ticket machines on the old-style vehicles had made him want the job. Mr Miliband made the admission during a visit to Stockton-on-Tees, where he was asked by a young boy in the audience, Nelson Driscoll, what he wanted to be when he was seven years old. He replied: 'I wanted to be a bus conductor. I tell you why, because on the London buses there used to be these things where you used to turn around the ticket machine. I was particularly fascinated by that.' Mr Miliband is not the only party leader to have dreamed of being on the buses. Conservative former prime minister Sir John Major once failed a test to become a bus conductor. The seat of Cheltenham is held by the Lib Dem Martin Horwood, who secured a majority of 4,920 over the Conservatives in 2010. But the constituency is seen as crucial to Tory hopes of winning an overall majority in the Commons. However, five years ago Labour secured just 5 per cent of the vote. Mr Miliband has promised to cut tuition fees from up to £9,000 to £6,000 if he is elected on May 7. Critics have argued the only people to benefit from the reductions will be wealthy graduates, because most people would never pay back the full amount during their working lifetime. But Mr Gilbert appeared to suggest the party should have gone further in reducing the cost of gaining a degree. He said: 'You know that in the Labour manifesto the fees will come down to £6,000 - it still feels entirely unsatisfactory.' He added: 'But it seems to me with two daughters who are 22 and 20, and they have been saddled with debt as the gentleman in the audience mentioned earlier. 'I find it really silly and really ridiculous that we have not worked this one through sufficiently well. 'We have choices. We have choices for all sorts of things, but we choose to spend the money on other things, and I wish we didn't, I wish we really didn't.' He finished his criticism of his party by adding: 'I don't like where we are, I wish it was different, but I hope we can see it differently going forward.'","Paul Gilbert jokes he hopes 'off-piste' remark will not get back to Miliband . Labour candidate in Cheltenham also blasts party's policy on tuition fees . Says Miliband vow to cut from £9,000 to £6,000 is 'entirely unsatisfactory'",c344595615063df7a5665083c5d10622db458f51
"The Middle East crisis deepened today as the US warned it will not 'stand by' while Iran supports rebels in Yemen. Secretary of State John Kerry said Washington would not accept foreign interference in the country in a direct criticism of Tehran's backing of Shiite Houthi fighters. It comes as a Saudi-led coalition continues to pound anti-government forces in Yemen at the start of a third week of bombing. Scroll down for video . US Secretary of State John Kerry has warned that the US will not 'stand by' while Iran supports rebels in Yemen . A member of the Saudi border guard is stationed at a look-out point on the Saudi-Yemeni border today. A Saudi-led coalition is continuing to pound anti-government forces in Yemen . Mr Kerry told PBS television: 'There have been - there are, obviously - flights coming from Iran. Every single week there are flights from Iran and we've traced it and know this. 'Iran needs to recognise that the United States is not going to stand by while the region is destabilised or while people engage in overt warfare across lines, international boundaries in other countries.' The United States has backed the Saudi-led campaign, which launched air strikes last month as the rebels advanced on Yemen's main southern city of Aden after seizing the capital Sanaa. President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi fled Aden for Saudi Arabia during the Houthi advance and the city has since seen heavy clashes between pro and anti-government forces. Riyadh has accused Tehran, the major Shiite power, of backing the rebels in a bid to establish a pro-Iran state on its doorstep. But Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif insisted his government wanted a swift end to the fighting, which has cost more than 640 lives since March 19, according to the World Health Organization. Military force: Saudi army tanks are seen deployed near the Saudi-Yemeni border, in southwestern Saudi Arabia . Patrol: Saudi guards drive tanks and armed vehicles along the border with Yemen . Mr Kerry, fresh from world powers striking a framework agreement with Iran on its nuclear programme, said Washington was not looking for confrontation with Tehran. 'But we're not going to step away from our alliances and our friendships and the need to stand with those who feel threatened as a consequence of the choices that Iran might be making.' In another sign of growing US support for the Saudi effort, the Pentagon said it had started daily aerial refuelling for warplanes in the coalition. The first refuelling flight took place on Tuesday night with a US Air Force KC-135 Stratotanker providing fuel for a F-15 fighter jet operated by Saudi Arabia and an F-16 flown by the United Arab Emirates, spokesman Colonel Steven Warren said. Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has warned that last week's  framework accord with world powers was no guarantee of a final nuclear deal. And President Hassan Rouhani said separately that the Islamic republic would not sign any final agreement unless 'all economic sanctions are totally lifted on the same day'. 'What has been done so far does not guarantee an agreement, nor its contents, nor even that the negotiations will continue to the end,' said Khamenei, who has the final word on all matters of state. After a week of gruelling last-ditch negotiations, Tehran and the six powers agreed on April 2 on the framework of a deal to be finalised by the end of June reining in Iran's nuclear programme in return for the lifting of international sanctions. 'Everything is in the detail, it may be that the other side, which is unfair, wants to limit our country in the details,' Khamenei said, in his first comments on the deal. Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has warned that last week's framework accord with world powers was no guarantee of a final nuclear deal . Playing down expectations of a deal after the interim accord - which sparked celebrations in the streets of Iranian cities - Khamenei said he had not taken any position until now as 'there is nothing to take a stance on'. 'Officials say that nothing has been done yet and there is nothing binding. I am neither for nor against.' Under the outline text agreed in the Swiss city of Lausanne between Tehran and the so-called P5+1 powers - the United States, Britain, China, France and Russia plus Germany - Iran must significantly reduce its number of centrifuges in exchange for a suspension of sanctions. The outline was a major breakthrough in a 12-year international crisis over Iran's nuclear programme. 'I have always supported and still support the Iranian negotiating team,' Khamenei said. 'I welcome any agreement that protects the interests and greatness of the nation, but having no agreement is more honourable than an agreement in which the interests and greatness of the nation is damaged.' Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said the Islamic republic would not sign any final agreement unless 'all economic sanctions are totally lifted on the same day' He said that retaining a civil nuclear industry in any agreement was vital for Iran's future development. 'The nuclear industry is a necessity, for energy production, for desalination, and in the fields of medicine, agriculture and other sectors,' he said. In a potential obstacle to any final deal, Rouhani said his country wanted sanctions lifted on the day of the implementation of any agreement. 'We will not sign any agreements unless on the first day of the implementation of the deal all economic sanctions are totally lifted on the same day,' he said. The pace at which the sanctions will be lifted is one of the outstanding issues that still has to be agreed in the final accord. Western governments, which have imposed their own sanctions over and above those adopted by the United Nations, have been pushing for it to happen only gradually. 'In return for Iran's future cooperation, we and our international partners will provide relief in phases from the sanctions that have impacted Iran's economy,' US Secretary of State John Kerry said last week. Rouhani, who was speaking on Iran's National Nuclear Technology Day, reiterated that his government remained determined to develop its civil nuclear programme. 'We will have a tanker sortie every day,' Warren said, adding that all flights will be outside of Yemeni air space. The air strikes killed at least 14 rebel fighters in Aden overnight Thursday at positions near the northern edge of the city, a source in pro-government forces told AFP. Air strikes also hit a military camp in the southern Shabwa province that was seized by the Houthis' main allies - security forces who have remained loyal to former strongman Ali Abdullah Saleh, a local official said. The official had no information on casualties among the forces loyal to Saleh, who has been accused of joining with the Houthis after being ousted from power in 2012 after an Arab Spring-inspired uprising. Yemen has been wracked by conflict since Saleh's ouster, with Hadi unable to assert government authority in a deeply tribal country riven by divisions. Supporters of the Shiite Houthi militia brandish their weapons in the Yemeni capital Sanaa. Washington has said it will not accept foreign interference in the country . Conflict: Yemeni supporters of the southern seperatist movement fire towards Houthi rebels during clashes in the southern city of Aden yesterday . As well as the Houthis, who hail from Yemen's north, the government has struggled against Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), considered the most dangerous of the jihadist network's branches. Authorities in Yemen had for years allowed Washington to carry out a drone war against AQAP but US forces pulled out of the country amid the latest unrest. Al-Qaeda has taken advantage of the chaos to seize control of some areas and carried out a series of deadly attacks on both government forces and the Houthis. As the fighting and air campaign drag on, concern has been growing for what aid workers say is a mounting humanitarian crisis. Some aid trickled in to Aden by ship on Wednesday but efforts by the International Committee of the Red Cross to organise flights of cargo planes into Sanaa have so far failed. In Aden, witnesses have said the situation is dire, with bodies lying in the streets and mosques calling through loudspeakers for help.

"A supporter waits the best part of an hour for five seconds with Ryan Taylor. There is a quick picture and good-luck message ahead of Sunday's Tyne-Wear derby. He is, evidently, one of the few players genuinely respected by Newcastle's disillusioned fans. Taylor scored the winner at the Stadium of Light three seasons ago, affording him a terrace tribute – 'Ryan Taylor, over the wall' – as well as a place in black-and-white folklore. But there is more to the Toon Army's admiration than one free-kick against the enemy. A working-class Scouser who came through the ranks at Tranmere and made 100 appearances by the time he was 21 before beating three career-threatening injuries, Taylor 'gets' the proud principles of the North East – appreciation, hard graft, honesty and enjoyment. He has himself been a fan in the crowd during three of the last four derby defeats - he watched the other from a hotel room in America after undergoing surgery on the second of the cruciate ligament injuries which kept him out for 26 months. Newcastle utility player Ryan Taylor (right) shields the ball from Arsenal forward Danny Welbeck . Taylor scores with a superb free-kick against Sunderland to win the game 1-0 at the Stadium of Light . Taylor is congratulated by Newcastle defender Steven Taylor  in the club's last victory over Sunderland . Newcastle supported him through that long rehabilitation, something for which Taylor will always be grateful. But with his current contract at St James' Park set to expire this summer, the 30-year-old does not know what the future holds. He would like to remain on Tyneside. He accepts, though, that this could be his final taste of the fixture which has guaranteed him lifelong worship. 'I have to be realistic, this could be my last derby,' he told Sportsmail. 'I don't want it to be, but that will be in my mind. So I'm not going to let it go the way of the last four - that cannot carry on. 'I've left the stadium gutted after every one of them and I've felt it like a fan. So we owe it to them now. 'I grew up with Liverpool and Everton, but that isn't as big because you live in the same house a lot of the time. 'So I'll be doing everything I can personally do to make sure we're up for it, because our performances in the last four just haven't been good enough.' Taylor returned after more than two years of painstaking gym sessions alone for October's 2-0 win at Manchester City in the League Cup. He was man-of-the-match and was greeted by a standing ovation in the dressing-room, where text messages from the likes of Steven Gerrard and Michael Owen awaited. Ninety minutes against the champions, however, had taken its toll. In the next game, at home to QPR, St James' was stunned into silence when, after half an hour, a tearful Taylor sat himself on the turf clutching the same ill-fated knee. Taylor's injury record at Newcastle has severely limited his first-team appearances over the past few years . The 30-year-old is incredibly grateful to Newcastle for sticking by him and hopes to repay them on Sunday . 'I thought to myself, 'Why me?',' he reflects. 'You start doubting whether the knee will ever be strong enough. I was thinking, 'What have I skipped? What have I done wrong?'. 'Within an hour of the game I'd had a scan and the cruciate was fine, relief isn't the word. I'd probably got through the City game on pure adrenaline. So I think it was my body telling me just take your time. 'I won't lie, the fact I'm out of contract was on my mind and I wanted to be back sooner than the three months it took. 'Every game felt like another game off my career. But we did what was right and now there are no problems at all. 'I'll admit there were times when I thought I couldn't do it and my old man just told me 'no'. 'So when you've had the tears and those dark days, you appreciate every minute.' On the subject of dark days, both Newcastle and Sunderland are horribly out of form going into what has been billed as 'The Desperation Derby'. The Black Cats could be in the relegation zone by the time kick-off arrives, while Newcastle have lost their last three under John Carver. To suffer another loss in the derby could prove unforgivable in the eyes of supporters whose last victory arrived courtesy of Taylor's right boot in August, 2011. 'The good thing is we've got a cracking game now and if anything can rally us for the rest of the season then this is it,' says Taylor, who will start at right back. 'To be on a winning team on the ground where it all started for me would make everything worthwhile, all of the hard work and long days during those two years. 'But I remember that day so well. It was my first derby. I've played in two now and I'm yet to lose. 'Jonas (Gutierrez) won a foul just on the corner of the box. My first Premier League goal – for Wigan against Newcastle – was from that exact position, so I fancied it. 'I remember seeing Simon Mignolet edging out, almost inviting me to put it in the top corner. That's what I did. Steven Taylor tried to claim it, but he was nowhere near it. He tried to celebrate my goal by himself! 'I knew my dad and brother were in the away end celebrating and I just thought, 'Wow. They will be having some time in there'. Taylor is one of the most popular players at Newcastle for his consistent and hard working performances . 'Dan Gosling – one of my best mates – went through on goal in the last minute. Looking back, I'm probably relieved he didn't score to make it 2-0! 'I didn't realise at the time how big scoring the winner was and how much I would be remembered for just one goal. 'It'll be amazing if I'm coming back here in 10 years' time with my two boys and they're still singing that song.' Taylor adds: 'I'll always be a Newcastle fan. This club has been brilliant with me. I could have been the forgotten man but they stuck by me. 'Now I need to show them that I can stay fit. I've had some terrible luck, but I'd like to think I've got a lot left in me. 'So this final part of the season is massive for me – I would love to stay here.' And with that the supporter has his photo. 'What's going to happen on Sunday?' Taylor is asked. '1-0. Ryan Taylor. Over the wall,' he laughs. You can see why they like him in these parts. Taylor is out of contract at the end of the season and admits he does not know what the future has in store .","Ryan Taylor's injury record has severely limited the number of first-team appearances he has made for Newcastle . Still, the 30-year-old utility player is one of the most popular at the club . Taylor etched himself into Newcastle folklore in 2011 by scoring the winner with a superb free-kick against rivals Sunderland . He is out of contract in the summer and Sunday's fixture at the Stadium of Light could be his last derby in a Newcastle shirt .",2c74e9cf11f6b11d160d42bd140b0e9d17173391
"A body found in the Mississippi River over the weekend has been identified as Minnesota fourth-grader Barway Edwin Collins who has been missing for nearly four weeks. Authorities said the body of the ten-year-old was found on Saturday around 1pm by searchers from a Boy Scout troop - about ten feet from the river's edge in Brooklyn Center. Crystal Police Chief Stephanie Revering said authorities have electronic evidence that shows the boy's father, Pierre Collins, 33, was in that area at the time the boy disappeared. However, she did not elaborate on the nature of that evidence. Police said on Sunday that the boy's father is a primary suspect as the case becomes a homicide investigation.

The Hennepin County Medical Examiner said the cause and manner of Barway's death are still being investigated. The case is being considered a homicide based on the autopsy and information from the medical examiner, said Revering. A report last month by Fox 9 said that according to sources, Pierre Collins, took out a life insurance policy in Barway's name totaling $30,000 not long before the child went missing. The boy's father, who has said he is innocent, has not been arrested or charged in relation to the incident, but Revering said authorities have his passport to ensure he stays in the country. Police were stationed at his apartment complex for his own protection after reports of death threats. On Sunday, Pastor Harding Smith, of the Spiritual Church of God who has been acting as the family's spokesman said when the family received the news, there were a lot of tears, according to Twin Cities. 'There were lots of tears and lots of screams,' he said. 'There was disbelief, hurt, sadness. There is a deep sense of loss when you enter that home.' Alexander Collins, executive director of the Liberian Ministry Association, said: 'We also want to make clear to the perpetrator of this tragedy, that wherever you are, you will be found. This evil will be found. 'Wherever you are hiding, under a car, underground, make no mistake our community does not abide this evil.' The Hennepin County Medical Examiner said the cause and manner of Barway's death are still being investigated . Barway, who was a student at Evergreen Park World Cultures Community School, was last seen after school last month. In video released by police (scenes from footage above), Barway says 'there's my dad' and 'there's my uncle' In a March 25 interview with the Star Tribune, Pierre Collins said he was not home when his son disappeared and he was upset to be considered a suspect. 'I've been working with the police just to bring my son home,' he told the newspaper. 'I will do whatever they want just so Barway can come home. I have nothing to do with Barway's missing.' His wife and Barway's stepmother, Yamah Collins, also said she and her husband did not know who took the boy, and they pleaded for his safe return. Pierre Collins (right), accompanied by Pastor Harding Smith (center), the family's spokesman, was interviewed by Nancy Grace last month, saying that he failed the polygraph test because he was very emotional . Police said on Sunday that the boy's father (above) is a 'primary suspect' as the case becomes a homicide investigation . Police released a video of Barway riding a bus after school. In the video, the boy said 'there's my dad' and 'there's my uncle.' 'The father and the party described as an 'uncle' are likely the last known people to have seen Barway,' Revering said, as reported by the Star-Tribune. 'Unfortunately, we have reason to believe that Barway's father has not been completely truthful with us.' Addressing the footage on the bus, Pierre Collins explained to Nancy Grace that in the Liberian community, children commonly refer to adults as 'uncle' or 'auntie.' When pressed by Grace about the failed polygraph test, Collins explained that he was 'very emotional' during the test. 'I wasn't...myself when I took the polygraph,' he said. The boy was reported missing by his father at around 6.30pm on March 18 after the child failed to come home from school (above a massive billboard featuring a missing ad for Barway) Barway, who was a student at Evergreen Park World Cultures Community School, was last seen after school last month. The boy was reported missing by his father at around 6.30pm on March 18 after the child failed to come home from school. A call to the school bus company revealed that the 10-year-old was dropped off outside his building at around 4.15pm. Video surveillance from his apartment complex shows he was about to go inside, but then turned around as if he was called over to the parking lot by someone he knew, and he walked away, police said last month.

A young boy adds a donation for Barway Collins' family to the pile during the vigil last month . The family told the Star Tribune that Barway emigrated from his home country of Liberia, where his mother lives, to stay with his father in 2011. The father said he wanted 'to make him better' and for Barway to eventually go to college. While looking for Barway, local police, federal agents and Hennepin County's sheriff's deputies searched the area with K-9 dogs, reviewing footage from surveillance cameras and interviewing family members and witnesses.","Barway Edwin Collins, 10, went missing from his Crystal, Minnesota apartment complex March 18 after school .

"Militants fighting for the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq are being led by a highly secretive group of strategists and officials that were once senior figures in Saddam Hussein's army. Despite thousands of foreign fighters flocking to join the Sunni extremist group and starring in their propaganda videos, ISIS' leadership is dominated by ex-members of the late Iraqi dictator's military. Almost all of the regional commanders appointed by ISIS' leader and self-declared caliph, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, played prominent roles in the Baathist army before the 2003 invasion of Iraq and became involved with ISIS either in the resulting insurgency or after the dictator's 2006 execution. Influence: Despite thousands of foreign fighters flocking to join the Sunni extremist group and starring in their propaganda videos, ISIS' leadership is dominated by ex-members of the military of Saddam Hussein (pictured) Militants: Almost all the highly secretive officials overseeing the day-to-day running of the Islamic State (pictured) are former members of Saddam Hussein's Baathist army . One of the most prominent former Iraqi Army generals within ISIS was Abu Muslim al-Turkmani (left) who led the terrorists' operations in Iraq until he was killed in an American airstrike last November. Abu Ayman al-Iraqi (right), a former colonel in Iraqi Air Force intelligence now plays a leading role in ISIS' military council . One former Syrian rebel who became an ISIS regional commander told the Washington Post that he found that almost all of the highly secretive officials overseeing all aspects to the terror group's day-to-day business were ex members of Hussein's Baathist army. During one meeting in which he dared to disagree with fellow commanders at an ISIS meeting, the man calling himself Abu Hamza was placed under arrest on the orders of a masked man who had sat silently and almost unnoticed at the side of the room, listening and taking notes. Although the enigmatic commander's real name was never revealed to him, Hamza said that he later discovered that the man had been an intelligence officer for the Iraqi army before joining ISIS. The same went for the other ISIS commanders Hamza met, who either used code names or no names at all in the hope of concealing their past as members of Hussein's army. As well as their extensive military expertise, another key element of the commanders' appointments has been the fact the ex-Baathists have extensive contacts among oil smugglers thanks to Hussein's efforts to avoid international sanctions in the 1990s. Crucially, oil smuggling is considered the most lucrative aspect of ISIS' £2 billion-a-year income. Leader: Almost all of the regional commanders appointed by ISIS' leader and self-declared caliph, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured), played prominent roles in the Baathist army before the 2003 invasion of Iraq . Experience: Former Iraqi Army colonel Haji Bakr (left) was al-Baghdadi's closest advisor and the overall head of his military council until his execution at the hands of Syrian rebels in January 2014. Pictured right is Abu Ahmad al-Alwani - a former Baathist soldier and now an ISIS military council member . The former Iraqi Army generals' connections with oil smugglers are crucial to ISIS' £2 billion-a-year income . Middle East analysts and experts believe one key reason why so many former Iraqi army commanders have joined ISIS is due to the de-Baathification law brought in L.­ Paul Bremer - the American who served as temporary head of the Iraqi state following the ousting of Hussein. The law effectively meant that 400,000 members of the defeated Iraqi army could no longer be employed in government roles and were barred from drawing their military pensions. Many of these highly-trained commanders joined the insurgency in the country in the mid-2000s, which was dominated by ISIS who at the time were known by the name Al Qaeda in Iraq. When al-Baghdadi took control of the group in 2010, many of these commanders were given prominent leadership roles in the hope they might win the support of the Sunni tribes who dominate Western Iraq and who have been largely ignored by the country's Shia-led Baghdad government. The process had, however been started by al-Baghdadi's predecessor Abu Omar al-Baghdadi who was himself a former Iraqi Army officer and therefore more trusted by the military than the Jordanian criminal, former gangster and ex-alcoholic who founded ISIS, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Past: The process of giving former Iraqi commanders senior roles was started by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's predecessor Abu Omar al-Baghdadi (left) who was a former Iraqi Army officer and therefore more trusted than the Jordanian criminal, former gangster and ex-alcoholic who founded ISIS, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi (right) Heartbreaking: The highest estimate for the number of recruits killed in the Speicher massacre is about 1,700 . Discovery: The graves were found last Wednesday on the late Saddam Hussein's presidential compound . One of the most prominent former Iraqi Army generals within ISIS was Fadel Ahmad Abdullah al-Hiyali, who used the code name Abu Muslim al-Turkmani, and was in charge of all the terrorists' operations in Iraq until he was killed in an American airstrike last November. He had previously been a colonel in military intelligence and served in Hussein's Republican Guard. Other senior figures include Abu Ali al-Anbari, who currently acts as Baghdadi's deputy leader in Syria and is a former military general in Hussein's Iraqi Army, and Abu Ayman al-Iraqi, a former colonel in Iraqi Air Force intelligence and now plays a leading role in ISIS' military council. Less prominent militants with an Iraqi Army backgrounds include Abu Ahmad al-Alwani - a former Baathist soldier and now an ISIS military council member, Abu Kassem - a former Iraqi officer and now in charge of ISIS suicide bombers and foreign fighters. Another former Iraqi Army colonel was Haji Bakr, who is widely considered to have been al-Baghdadi's closest advisor and the overall head of his military council until his execution at the hands of a rebel group known as the Syrian Martyr's Brigade in January 2014. It is widely believed that all of the senior ISIS figures killed over the past year - including Haji Bakr - have been replaced by former members of the Iraqi Army. Horror: Images like this one of the soldiers being led through Tikrit shocked Iraq and the world . This morning Iraqi forensic teams in the newly liberated city of Tikrit have started exhuming bodies from mass graves believed to contain some of the hundreds of soldiers killed by ISIS last year. Kamil Amin, from Iraq's Human Rights Ministry, said the work on eight locations started yesterday inside Tikrit's complex of presidential palaces, where much of the killing is thought to have occured. ISIS overran Saddam Hussein's hometown last June, capturing around 1,700 soldiers as they were trying to flee Camp Speicher, an air base previously used by U.S. troops on the outskirt of Tikrit. The fall of Tikrit was part of the ISIS onslaught that stunned Iraqi security forces and the military, which melted away as the militants advanced and captured key cities and towns in the country's north and west. Later, ISIS group posted graphic images online that showed gunmen massacring scores of the soldiers after forcing them to lay face-down in a ditch with their arms tied behind their backs. After weeks of bitter clashes, Iraqi forces and allied Shiite militias, succeeded in retaking Tikrit from ISIS. Their victory was helped by U.S.-led coalition airstrikes.",ISIS leadership is dominated by former members of Hussein's Iraqi Army .

"Two teenage girls were savagely beaten by a crowd of people, including parents and other adults, in a New Jersey park as onlookers videotaped the riot and encouraged the violence to continue. Destiny Cooke, 16, and Lajahia Cooke, 17, were brutally kicked, punched, stomped and shoved around by the mob, who can be heard laughing during the five-minute video filmed in Trenton. Lajahia said one girl ripped out her earring out before the girl's mother threw a rock at her ear, leaving a gash that required 12 stitches. Scroll down for video . Sisters Destiny Cooke, 16, and Lajahia Cooke, 17, were brutally kicked, punched, stomped and shovedy a crowd of people, including grown adults and parents, in a park in Trenton, New Jersey . People can be heard laughing throughout the video and chanting 'they gettin' busy!' or 'let her get her!' And Destiny has been left with a bald spot after someone grabbed a chunk of her hair. Throughout the video various people hold the girls down so that others can punch them over and over again. One guy can be heard gleefully screaming 'they gettin' busy!' At one point, according to ABC 7, someone tries to break up the fight but an adult is determined to let it continue, screaming 'let her get her!' But perhaps the most disturbing part of the video is when, while Destiny is on the ground, her skirt rides up and men proceed to laugh and take pictures, one even exclaiming 'somebody smack that!' Destiny said she was play fighting with her friend at the park on a nice day during spring break last Monday before the riot broke out. She said people saw her and her friend and got the wrong idea. They came back with a crowd of people who, she said, were looking for a fight. When Lajahia tried to step in and help Destiny, all hell broke loose. 'It just escalated from there,' Destiny told NJ.com. 'Just like a riot broke out, they just started hitting us.' Destiny said she called her mother and asked her to pick the girls, telling her there were 'grown women' walking up to the sisters. That's when then the 16-year-old first got hit, causing her to drop her phone. 'I just had to defend myself,' she told MY 9 NJ. The girls said they saw multiple police cars at the park as they left. Destiny said no one got out to offer the girls any help, even as Destiny's nose was bleeding. Destiny (pictured) has been left with a bald spot after people pulled on her hair throughout the fight . Lajahia said one girl ripped an earring out of her ear, and then the girl's mother threw a rock at her ear, leaving a gash that required 12 stitches . 'They just stayed in their cars and just looked at us,' Destiny said. 'I just felt like we were out there by ourselves and there were people stomping us on our head,' she told NJ.com. 'Nobody was out there trying to help us - nobody.' According to police spokesman Lt. Stephen Varn, patrol officers received a 911 call for a reported street fight. Two patrol units arrived at the scene of the brawl and reported that no other police officers were needed. Trenton Mayor Eric Jackson released a statement saying he was angered 'by the lack of good Samaritans who should have stepped forward to come to the aid of these victims'. A park ranger has since been installed to monitor Greg Grant Park. Police Captain Eddie Gonzalez called the video 'sickening' and said the department had identified 'a number of individuals that were a part of this'. 'We will take swift action with them very, very shortly,' he said. 'Warrants will be issued in the very near future.' Destiny said police just 'stayed in their cars' and stared as she and her sister Lajahia (pictured) left the park after being brutally beaten .","Destiny Cooke, 16, and Lajahia Cooke, 17 were beaten by a mob in Trenton .

"Gemma Redhead was left terrified after her former partner telephoned her after he was released from prison, following a conviction for raping her . Brutally raped at knifepoint and left fearing for her life, Gemma Redhead believed her ordeal was over after her attacker was jailed. But as she attempted to rebuild her life, the young mother had a sickening reminder of the attack – from the man who carried it out. After he was released from prison, having served only half his sentence, he defied a restraining order to phone her. Miss Redhead said the 46-second call ‘reawakened all of the fear and terror of the attack’, leaving her unable to sleep or eat. ‘As soon as I heard his voice I realised who it was, and it disturbed something deep down inside of me,’ she said. Miss Redhead, 33, who has waived her right to anonymity, was left with post-traumatic stress disorder after being repeatedly raped by her former partner, Philip Kirby. She endured eight years of violence at the hands of bullying Kirby and his attacks became so brutal she lived in fear every day, thinking he would kill her. In August 2010 the mother-of-four, who has a child with Kirby, decided to break up with him. After they separated, Kirby, 32, refused to acknowledge the end of their relationship and begged Miss Redhead to take him back. He continued to harass her and eventually forced his way into her home before subjecting her to a harrowing ordeal. After the first horrifying attack, Miss Redhead begged him to leave, but he told her: ‘I’m already going to jail for a long time so what difference does it make?’ before raping her again. Kirby, of Newcastle, initially denied rape. But on the first day of his trial he changed his plea, admitting four counts of rape. In April 2011, he was jailed for eight years with a five-year extended licence period. He was also handed a restraining order which banned any contact with Miss Redhead for the rest of her life. Meanwhile she began counselling, including cognitive therapy, and medication to help her overcome her post-traumatic stress disorder. But she says her hopes of rebuilding her life have now been shattered. She said: ‘It is a daily struggle and an ongoing battle to deal with this. After his initial arrest I was hopeful for the future and felt free and that I could begin to rebuild my life. Philip Kirby had been sentenced to eight years in prison but was released after three years, and phoned his former partner. The rapist had been banned from contacting her for life and will now not be released until 2023 . ‘I now feel it will never be so and he will not leave me alone.’ Referring to the chilling phonecall, Miss Redhead added: ‘But at the same time I was not surprised. I had always felt as though he would come after me once he was released.’ She said Kirby had tried to ‘destroy’ her and she feared he would continue to harass her for the rest of her life. ‘We tried so hard to rebuild our lives after he virtually destroyed it,’ she said. ‘He will never leave us alone. We just can’t escape him. We feel trapped by his behaviour. Why can’t he just leave us alone to get on with our lives? I just want my family to be left in peace.’ Miss Redhead described herself as being in an ‘extreme state of anxiety’ since the phone call from Kirby. She said: ‘I will no longer go outside on my own. I can’t eat or sleep and when I do sleep I have constant nightmares and flashbacks. I am really scared. Ms Redhead was left with post traumatic stress disorder after the attack. She is pictured (above) with Kirby during their relationship . ‘Despite telling probation he wouldn’t contact me, he has. Prison has not been a deterrent for him. I feel very fearful of what he would do next. ‘I am still full of fear. I would like to be free of fear and not constantly worrying about his next release date.’ After the phone call Kirby was hauled back to court and he admitted breaching his restraining order. On Friday, Newcastle Crown Court heard that Kirby was released from prison in November last year and after drinking vodka he decided to contact his victim last month. He was sentenced to a further six months and will not be released until 2023, serving his full jail term. Judge Deborah Sherwin said: ‘What makes this matter particularly bad is the effect she suffered at your hands originally. ‘It is not part of my function to sentence you again in respect of that but it is the legacy of that, that she feels vulnerable and afraid, therefore any phone calls made by you would have a greater effect on her than they might do to any other person.’","Philip Kirby was jailed for eight years in 2011 for raping Gemma Redhead .

"Keeping David de Gea at the club would be the biggest signing Manchester United could make this summer, says Phil Neville.

"A Michigan father convicted of abusing his then-11-week-old daughter who might lose parental rights to his only child claims his baby was never abused. Joshua Quincy Burns, formerly of Brighton, was sentenced to three years' probation with the first served in Livingston County Jail for second-degree child abuse earlier this month. Joshua Burns and and his wife, Brenda Burns, say he is innocent, and that he grabbed their daughter Naomi's face when she slipped from his lap as he ended a phone call with his wife in March 2014. He claims he was trying to save her from hitting her head on a coffee table in their home. His now-one-year-old daughter suffered several injuries, including seizures, hypothermia, hypotension, bradycardia, apnea and retinal hemorrhages. But the couple call it 'an accident', not child abuse. Scroll down for video . Joshua Burns (right) was sentenced to three years' probation with the first served in Livingston County Jail for second-degree child abuse after his daughter Naomi (in his arms) suffered several injuries. He and his wife Brenda Burns (left) maintain Joshua Burns's innocence . Brenda Burns has refused to allow social workers and Michigan's Department of Human Services to see Naomi, according to the Livingston Daily. She was not charged criminally in the case, and a civil jury - when the state was seeking to end parental rights - found Brenda Burns not accountable for Naomi's injuries. The couple started a website called TornFamily in hopes of raising awareness of their situation and reunite their family. They will also be sharing their story on an episode of Dr Phil on Monday, and Joshua Burns maintains his innocence throughout the episode. 'I never abused my daughter,' he claims in the preview for the show. Joshua Burns claims he never abused little Naomi, and she suffered injuries after she slipped off his lap while he was ending a phone call with his wife and in an attempt to save his daughter from hitting her head on a coffee table he grabbed her by the face . Brenda Burns (right) has fled from Michigan to Colorado with Naomi in an attempt to escape being watched by DHS. Their oversight has been put on hold until a June hearing where Joshua Burns's parental rights will be determined . After the incident, baby Naomi suffered several injuries, including seizures, hypothermia, hypotension, bradycardia, apnea and retinal hemorrhages . 'Then why are you in jail?' Dr Phil asks in return. Brenda Burns claims that a Child Protective Services worker and five police officers entered their home and searched her house when the incident occurred. 'I literally thought: Do you have the right family?' she said to Dr Phil. Brenda Burns's attorney Elizabeth Warner said that the mother has the right to not be monitored by the government, and 'certainly not by the agency that takes children' because she was not held responsible for the injuries and is seen as 'the fit parent' Earlier this month, Judge Miriam Cavanaugh said the DHS's supervision of Naomi would continue but is on hold pending the decision as to whether or not Joshua Burns will continue to have parental rights, according to the Free Press. Joshua Burns continues to claim he's innocent. In an episode of Dr Phil airing Monday, he says, 'I never abused my daughter' Even though her husband has been jailed, Brenda Burns supports her husband and agrees that the incident was 'an accident', not child abuse . Brenda Burns fled to Colorado to avoid being watched DHS, which she believes is unconstitutional. Naomi's court-appointed attorney has reportedly seen the child and says told the Livingston County Circuit Court that the baby is doing well. Warner, Brenda Burns's attorney, said that Naomi is 'doing very well' and that 'she's pretty advanced for her age'. She said: 'You can see pictures of a sick child with tubes in them and think she's going to be brain damaged forever. 'In fact, if this was a misdiagnosis as we think it was, I think the fact Naomi is so well really supports the parents' position this wasn't abuse. It was a misdiagnoses by a doctor. 'It's something she recovered from.' The hearing over the potential termination of Joshua Burns's parental rights is in June.

"Many people might think that trust issues, long distances and cheating scandals are the biggest strains on a relationship. But they are wrong. It's IKEA. A psychology expert has confirmed that shopping at or assembling furniture from the Scandinavian store chain can be a serious source of friction between a couple, thanks to the high levels of stress caused by both activities. 'The store literally becomes a map of a relationship nightmare,' Ramani Durvasula, a clinical psychologist in Santa Monica, California, told The Wall Street Journal. Scroll down for video . Can your relationship handle it? Experts say that shopping at IKEA can cause serious friction between couples - and assembling the store's wares makes it even worse . 'Walking through the kitchens brings up touchy subjects, like who does most of the cooking. Then you get to the children’s section, which opens up another set of issues. And that’s before you've even tried assembling anything,' she said. Ramani revealed that so many couples admitted to her that they were prone to fighting while assembling furniture, that she decided to include furniture assembly in her therapy sessions. And her couples are not alone; a report by CivicScience states that 17 per cent of couples confessed that they would argue every time they assembled furniture together, and therapists reported to WSJ that couples who are able to successfully assemble furniture together as a team actually have a healthier relationship. 'The Divorcemaker': This Liatorp home entertainment unit requires two people for assembly and involves putting together a large amount of shelving . Shopping for trouble: Clinical psychologist Ramani Durvasula brings furniture assembly into therapy sessions after so many couples described fighting while putting together IKEA items . Getting into particulars, Ramani explained that the more complicated the assembly, the more likely your new IKEA buy will leave you and your partner at odds. She revealed that a smaller unit like a Nornäs coffee table won't put too many demands on your relationship, but it's a different story for a large wall unit like the $1,199 Liatorp unit, which Ramani has dubbed 'The Divorcemaker'. The description of the item on IKEA's website includes a lengthy 'Good To Know' section outlining the different ways you can mess up the unit's assembly, saying that you need two people to put it together. 'Handle with care!' it reads. 'A damaged edge or scratched surface can in exceptional cases cause the glass to crack suddenly. However, never into sharp fragments, only into small pieces. Avoid collisions from the side - this is where the glass is most vulnerable.' Its relationship-ruining qualities don't seem to be doing the the home furnishings giant any harm however, as it has 298 stores in 26 countries, and boasts a revenue of more than $36 billion a year. As for how to avoid having the dreaded 'IKEA meltdown' with your partner, Janice Simonsen, design spokesperson for IKEA US, recommends to WSJ that you agree on a style before walking into the store.","A psychology expert has revealed that the stress of a visit to the store can cause serious friction between couples .

"Claudia Martin, 33, has been convicted of suffocating her newborn baby daughter . A mother-of-five has been convicted of killing her newborn baby girl by filling her mouth with toilet paper and hiding her body in a suitcase. Claudia Martins gave birth alone at her sister's flat having kept her pregnancy secret from her family and friends. Paramedics were called after the 33-year-old, a Portuguese national, was found sitting in the bath with 'a lot of blood' and she was taken to hospital. Earlier she had killed the infant by stuffing toilet paper down its throat. She then wrapped the baby girl in towels and a plastic bag and hid the body in a suitcase - where it lay undiscovered for three days. Martins was acquitted by a jury of a single charge of murder but convicted of manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility. During her trial at Bristol Crown Court the jury was told she gave birth alone at her sister's flat in Knowle, Bristol on September 12 last year. Adam Vaitilingam QC, prosecuting, said: 'She told no-one of her pregnancy and gave birth in as secretive a way as she could, for someone living in a crowded flat, and kept the fact of that birth secret from all those around her and closest to her, including her sister. 'She placed the body of the baby in a suitcase, hidden from anyone. 'No doubt, we suggest she intended to dispose of it but was prevented from doing so by the arrival of the paramedics, who took her off to hospital.' Two days later, her sister Vilma raised the alarm after noticing a smell coming from a suitcase in the defendant's bedroom. Police were called to the flat and discovered the body of a newborn baby inside Martins' small, black suitcase, on September 15. Martins, described as having an extremely low IQ, was arrested and admitted she had given birth but said the baby was stillborn. A post-mortem examination found a wad of toilet paper inside the baby's mouth, which experts claim was 'deliberately inserted'. The jury heard Martins is originally from Mozambique in Africa but moved to Portugal before settling in Bristol in 2011, living in a two-bedroom flat with her sister Vilma Marshall, Ms Marshall's partner, and five children. Giving evidence, Martins told the court: 'I did not kill my daughter. I did not put tissue paper in her throat. I didn't kill her. No, I did not kill my daughter.' Mr Justice Teare remanded Martins, of Marshall Walk, Knowle, Bristol into custody to await the preparation of reports. She will be sentenced at a later date. Detective Inspector Neil Meade, of Avon and Somerset Police, said: 'The death of a baby is always a tragedy but the unique circumstances make this a particularly emotive case for everyone involved. 'We carried out a sensitive and comprehensive investigation into the circumstances of the baby girl's death and obtained statements from medical experts specialising in this field. 'We've also worked closely with the Crown Prosecution Service from the outset. The jury has listened to the evidence and convicted Claudia Martins of manslaughter. 'Our thoughts are very much with the victim's wider family as they are struggling to comprehend how and why this tragedy happened.'

"Her brother-in-law has led a personal crusade against poaching and protecting vulnerable wildlife. So Pippa Middleton’s decision to enjoy a plate of whale meat on holiday may have been rather difficult for Prince William to swallow. The 31-year-old, who styles herself as a food and lifestyle writer, has told of eating Minke whale – even though it is largely banned worldwide. She boasted of tucking into the delicacy in Norway, to the horror of environmental campaigners who say she is helping promote an ‘unimaginably cruel’ trade. Scroll down for video . Pippa Middleton has been slammed for ‘promoting the cruel and unnecessary whaling industry’. She's pictured here at the 2014 GQ Men Of The Year awards in London . In a gushing newspaper feature, the Duchess of Cambridge’s younger sister described how the smoked meat was served in a ‘wonderfully convivial atmosphere’ at the Juvet Landscape Hotel in north-west Norway. Tucking into a starter prepared carpaccio-style – raw and very thinly sliced – she wrote: ‘We dined on smoked whale carpaccio (which tastes similar to smoked salmon but looks more like venison carpaccio).’ Ms Middleton said that she ate whale carpaccio in a 'convivial atmosphere on a large communal table' Earlier she had enjoyed a steam bath and rubbed ice on her body in a ‘snow spa’ at the upmarket hotel, where she spent the night in a £170-a-night ‘designer pod’. The hunting and importation of whale meat is banned in Britain, as it is in most parts of the world, by both the International Whaling Commission and by the international wildlife convention CITES. But Norway – as well as Japan and Iceland – has exploited legal loopholes that allow it to opt out of regulations. Last year it killed around 730 Minke whales, the highest number since it broke the moratorium on commercial whaling in 1993. Campaigners have long called for a crackdown, arguing the hunting process is ‘unimaginably cruel and inhumane’. The socialite, writing in the Daily Telegraph, said that she ate whale at the £123-a-night Juvet Landscape Hotel (pictured) Ms Middleton said that the dinner was cooked by Knut, the hotel’s owner. The Duchess of Cambridge's sister said that the establishment was an 'architectural gem' Pippa Middleton would be breaking British law if she had tucked into the whale meat in the UK. Britain has signed up to the International Whaling Commission, which makes it illegal to import or eat whale meat in this country. Whaling is also prohibited under EU law, but Norway is not a member of the EU. Last season, 731 minke whales were killed in Norway off the country’s northern coasts. The whaling season runs from April to August, when they are hunted from boats using grenade-propelled harpoons, which are shot from cannons into the whale’s chest. In the 1960s and 70s whale meat was commonly served in Norwegian school canteens and as part of military rations. It then fell out of favour, but has recently been adopted as a gourmet food trend. Fish market manager Marius Tvethaug said: ‘Smoked whale is one of the oldest ways to keep food for a long time. And we’ve been catching whale since the Stone Age. I would say it’s kind of back to our roots.’ Even with modern harpoons powered by explosives, the mammals often died a ‘slow and painful’ death. Critics said Miss Middleton’s decision to eat whale meat was at odds with the stance taken by Prince William – even though he too has been attacked for continuing to hunt wild game. She has also been photographed hunting in the past. Vanessa Williams-Grey, of Whale and Dolphin Conservation, said: ‘It might have been better for Pippa to take a whale watch trip in Norway. She might then have thought twice about condoning and indeed, promoting, this cruel and unnecessary trade.’ Philip Mansbridge, UK director of the International Fund for Animal Welfare, said she was ‘unwittingly setting a bad example’ that may encourage other tourists. A spokesman for Miss Middleton, who travelled on the junket for the Daily Telegraph, refused to comment last night. But Knut Slinning, owner of Juvet Landscape Hotel, said he had no plans to stop serving whale meat because it has been eaten for ‘many hundreds of years’. However, Siri Martinsen, of Norway’s animals rights group NOAH, said Miss Middleton has a ‘special responsibility’ not to support animal cruelty. Last year 731 minke whales suffered an agonising death at the hand of Norwegian whalers, according to WDC. Pictured is a minke whale on the deck of a Japanese vessel . Three Greenpeace inflatables  interrupt whaling on board the Norwegian whaling vessel Kato in the Southern whaling grounds in the North Sea .

"BBC presenter Charlie Stayt has been blasted after he misspelt the word 'education' during a live report on the issue. Viewers took to Twitter to complain after he missed out the letter 'c' when he scrawled the word on a whiteboard at a primary school in Southampton, Hampshire. Viewer Hardy Lion tweeted: '#bbcbreakfast ha ha spelt education wrong!!! Back to school!' Back to school: Eagle-eyed viewers spotted Charlie Stayt's embarrassing spelling error during a live broadcast . The presenter left out the letter 'c' when he wrote the word for the third time on the whiteboard this morning . The presenter later described the gaffe as 'one of those things,' after being alerted  to it by colleagues . Whilst Mike Knowles tweeted: 'If you're presenting a live report about education on #BBCBreakfast maybe double check how you spell education.' Viewer John Morley added: 'Fantastic, #bbcbreakfast presenter can't spell education.' Crafty Monkey wrote: '@BBCBreakfast C-!! Could do better!' Afterwards, Bill Turnbull told Stayt he had started a Twitter frenzy and made him spell out the word education live on air. He said: 'There we go, it was a typo, we'll forgive him.' Presenter Sally Nugent added: 'I don't think that spelling mistake was that bad.' Stayt said: 'Let's just call it one of those things.' But Turnbull added: 'You've only caused a Twitter frenzy in two-and-a-half minutes.' Nugent said: 'I don't think anyone's noticed.' Stayt was discussing the issue of education at Highfield Primary School as part of the programme's UK sofa tour in the run up to the election. Blunder: Stayt was broadcasting from Highfield Primary School in Southampton, Hampshire . Afterwards, colleague Bill Turnbull made red-faced Stayt spell the word 'education' US politician Dan Quayle was mocked when he misspelt the word 'potato' on a school blackboard on June 15, 1992 when he was visiting a school in Trenton as part of his official duties. He took part in a spelling bee when students had to write words on a blackboard. When it was 12-year-old William Figueroa's turn he had to write the word 'potato'. But Quayle pointed out: 'You're close, but you left a little something off. The e on the end'. In December last year, police in South Yorkshire were left embarrassed after taking delivery of a new patrol car with POLCE emblazoned on the side. In April 2013, council workmen somehow managed to spell 'school' wrong outside Innellan Primary School, near Dunoon in Scotland. They painted 'sckool' on the road instead. Bungling workers were slammed in February 2013 in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, after they put up a sign for a historic Welsh bridge - but misspelled it 'Whelsh'. In March 2012, Oxfordshire council workers misspelled 'SCHOOL' as 'SCHOUL' in traffic markings outside Wolverton Primary School.

"'Boring' has been the word on everyone's lips when talking about Chelsea this week, but Didier Drogba has shown he and his team-mates still have the skill to disprove that disparaging tag. The Blues are preparing for Wednesday night's trip to Leicester City at St George's Park, having drawn criticism for the way they ground out a decisive 0-0 draw against Arsenal on Sunday. And Drogba and his team-mates, who can wrap up the Barclays Premier League title with two more victories, have shown off their abilities with an intricate six-man heading trick around the dinner table. Didier Drogba hit back at claims that Chelsea were boring with a video of them completing a 'bin challenge' After the ball is headed by Loic Remy and Eden Hazard, John Terry heads to Drogba in the six-man task . After Drogba, goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois is the next to take the ball, heading back to John Obi Mikel . Mikel stoops with a diving header that sees him fall off his chair, but the ball does drop into the small bin . Manager Jose Mourinho shot back at claims that his side were boring this week, insisting that going 10 years without winning the league - as Arsenal have - was more boring, and now Drogba has added to the retort with a video captioned: 'Boring boring chelseaaaa!!!!!!' With six players seated opposite each other on either side of a long table, Branislav Ivanovic throws the ball on to the head of Loic Remy to start the game. He heads back to Eden Hazard, who then directs it on to John Terry followed by Drogba and Thibaut Courtois before John Obi Mikel stoops to knock the ball into a bin with a diving header. After just about managing to complete the feat all seven players celebrate wildly, the sort of scenes that might be seen against Crystal Palace on Sunday if Chelsea win at the King Power Stadium and then on their return to Stamford Bridge. The champions-elect have been preparing for Wednesday night's game at the National Football Centre at Burton-on-Trent since Monday, where they are staying at the on-site Hilton Hotel. While French forward Remy was more than willing to jump around with his team-mates in the video at the hotel, he has been ruled out of the game against Leicester by  Mourinho. With Mikel on the floor, Courtois and Terry leap into the air in celebrations that could soon be repeated . The seven players involved in the game at St George's Park jump around in a celebratory huddle . Drogba and his team-mates can wrap up the Barclays Premier League title with two more league victories . Diego Costa is also a doubt having missed almost a month of action with a hamstring problem that has bugged him for much of the season. Midfielder Oscar has a chance of returning from the concussion he suffered against Arsenal in a challenge by goalkeeper David Ospina on Sunday. St George's Park, which opened in October 2012, is used by the full range of England teams as well as club sides. Barcelona, Galatasaray and Monaco are among the visiting teams to have stayed there. Terry and his team-mates celebrate at full-time at the Emirates Stadium after stepping closer to the title .","Didier Drogba and five of his Chelsea team-mates take part in bin challenge .

"Selfie queen Karen Danczuk has revealed her ambition to be an MP – insisting she could relate to ordinary women unlike the current crop of female politicians. Mrs Danczuk said women were turned off politics because there was no-one in Parliament like them. The glamorous Labour councillor, who is married to the outspoken MP Simon Danczuk, said Parliament needed people like her ‘to bring it back down to reality’. Scroll down for video . Selfie queen Karen Danczuk told LBC's Nick Ferrari (pictured) in Liverpool today that she aspired to be an MP – insisting she could relate to ordinary women unlike the current crop of female politicians . Mrs Danczuk, 31, who revealed earlier this year that she had suffered sexual abuse, told LBC’s Nick Ferrari that she had rebuilt her life after being ‘shattered’ as a child. She said she used provocative selfie pictures on Twitter as a way of saying to others: ‘I will not be ashamed about who I am.’ Mrs Danczuk said she had rebuilt her life after the abuse, but now had the confidence to go into politics. She said: ‘There’s not many women that can relate to women. The women we do have in politics – and I’m not being rude to them because they’re really, really good – are they relating to ordinary women? I think they could relate a bit more.’ Mrs Danczuk became a hit on Twitter after posting a series of provocative photos of herself. She now describes herself as the 'selfie queen' Mrs Danczuk, 31, who revealed earlier this year that she had suffered sexual abuse, told LBC’s Nick Ferrari that she had rebuilt her life after being ‘shattered’ as a child . Ms Danczuk was asked if she would go into mainstream politics and replied: ‘Yeah, I would. I think in some ways women like me need to, to bring it back down to reality.’ The mother of two said she didn’t agree with the way women politicians always talked about female issue like childcare. She said: ‘I don’t necessarily think we should assume that because you’re a women, you should focus all your time and effort focussing on childcare. ‘Just speaking a language they understand – you know, dashing to do a school run, to then dash to the supermarket – just speaking about everyday problems.’ She said: ‘Women that I speak to, there’s just nothing there for them to relate to.’ Karen Danczuk, pictured outside Parliament last week, could find herself on the Commons benches with her husband . Mrs Danczuk, the Labour councillor and wife of MP Simon Danczuk, stopped for a drink at the Red Lion pub outside Parliament . Mrs Danczuk also spoke about the sex abuse abuse she suffered as a child and called for anyone who had gone through it to see a therapist. She said: ‘It shatters you – you trust no-one. You have nightmares. You can’t live a normal live.’ But she said therapy had helped. ‘I will not be ashamed about who I am. I used to be ashamed. If anyone says you shouldn’t wear low-cut tops – no, reclaiming your body is a part of the process of recovery. ‘Your body has been taken away from you – they take your body, you lose control of it. It’s not a good place to be.’ She said she used to have ‘horrific nightmares’ every night and couldn’t sleep. Mrs Danczuk said having therapy and ‘dealing with it’ had transformed her life. ‘I don’t think I’m God’s gift to man, but I just have that confidence back because I’ve took control of my life – because that’s what therapy does.’ She said selfies were important to her because they allowed her to be herself. ‘It’s just been happy with you.

"A Missouri woman who finished a St. Louis marathon third last year and was the female winner of it this year is being stripped of the title after officials concluded she didn't run the full course either year. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that officials determined that Kendall Schler crept onto the GO! St. Louis Marathon's course last weekend after the last checkpoint, didn't record any of her times electronically along the way, and didn't run the entire 26.2 miles. Schler was spotted at the beginning of the race and the end of the race, and while Schler's actual course is unknown, the starting point of the race are suspiciously just three blocks apart. Scroll down for video . Fake winner: Kendall Schler cheated her way to the front of the St. Louis marathon course . Not a true winner: Her times that qualified her to run in Monday's Boston Marathon have now been erased, and her spot in the event has been vacated . Kendall Schler crept onto the marathon course after the last checkpoint and since she was spotted  at the starting point of the race just blocks from finish line, she may have lingered in that area before sneaking in . Schler claims to have removed both the magnetic strips meant to record her times from her race (violation of race protocol) and since no photographs of her were taken along the way there is no proof she is the rightful winner. Her finish time that qualified her to run in Monday's Boston Marathon has now been erased, and her spot in the event has been vacated. Her third-place finish last year also was wiped out after officials couldn't find evidence that she crossed any of that event's checkpoints. 'It’s a difficult situation for everybody, including the people who run a fair race and don’t get the recognition they should receive,' said Nancy Lieberman, president of GO! St. Louis. 'I said to her, ""It looks like you perpetrated a fraud.""' 'I have nothing legitimate that says she officially started and ran 26.2 miles in 2014 or 2015,' she added. Lieberman said incidents of dishonest runners happened but called this 'an extreme case.' When Lieberman made Schler prove she ran all of the checkpoints from last years race she was unable to provide them and he title was stripped from her. 'I said, ""I’m going to disqualify you in 2014 unless you provide me photos of you along the course,"" ' Lieberman said. 'I told her if she showed me photos within two hours I’d consider not disqualifying her.'

St. Louis on the Martin Luther King Bridge during the race . The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that the course has seven spots where a runner is meant to record a time. The spots are the start, the finish, and five spots within the course. Lieberman said she did not register a time at any spot. There was no electronic evidence of any of those times either. According to the president of the marathon Nancy Leiberman, Schler claimed to have removed the magnetic strips from both of her race bibs. Tampering with race bibs is a violation of race protocol, says Leiberman. Lieberman checked with U.S. Track and Field officials on the course who also saw no sign of her. 'They’re situated in specific places so that people can’t cheat and jump on at other times,' Lieberman said. 'They didn’t see (Schler) anywhere on the course.' The true winner of the race was a woman named Angela Karl who Lieberman says didn't get the recognition that she deserved. 'There’s a euphoria the winner gets, breaking the tape and having the crowd cheer,' Lieberman said. 'The true winner did everything right and didn’t get her due.'

"We’ve all been there: you hear a catchy song and for days - or even weeks - on end you just can’t get it out of your head. Known as an earworm or brainworm, the effect has been studied before - but its cause, and how to get rid of it, is poorly understood. Now researchers say they have an answer; chewing gum after hearing a catchy song will help you think about it less often. Reading scientists say chewing gum helps you forget a song. In a study people were less likely to think about it when chewing (stock image shown). And they were a third less likely to 'hear' it when chewing gum. The results suggests same technique could stop other intrusive thoughts . The study was carried out by scientists at the University of Reading. In the research 98 volunteers were played the ‘catchy tunes’ Play Hard by David Guetta and Payphone by Maroon 5. - Recent music exposure . - Repeated music exposure . - Word triggers (eg. the word ‘faith’) - People triggers (where sight or memory of a person is associated with a song) - Situation trigger (eg. weddings can cause you to remember your own first dance song) - Stress . - Surprise . - Dreams . - Mind wandering . Over the next three minutes, they were then asked to hit a key every time they thought of the songs - while chewing gum, not chewing gum or tapping their finger. While chewing gum, volunteers reported thinking of the song less often than when they weren’t chewing gum, or when they were told to tap their finger instead. And chewing gum also reduced the amount they ‘heard’ the song in their minds by a third. The study is the first to examine the effects of chewing gum on earworms - and it suggests it could also be used to stop other unwanted or intrusive thoughts. ‘Interfering with our own “inner speech” through a more sophisticated version of the gum-chewing approach may work more widely,’ said Dr Phil Beaman, from the University’s School of Psychology and Clinical Language Sciences, who led the study. In the research 98 volunteers were played the ‘catchy tunes’ such as Play Hard by David Guetta and Payphone by Maroon 5 (pictured). Over the next three minutes, they were then asked to hit a key every time they thought of the songs - while chewing gum, not chewing gum or tapping their finger . While chewing gum, volunteers reported thinking of the song less often than when they weren’t chewing gum, or when they were told to tap their finger instead. And chewing gum also reduced the amount they ‘heard’ the song in their minds by a third (stock image shown) ‘However more research is needed to see whether this will help counter symptoms of obsessive-compulsive and similar disorders.’ In a previous study by the University of Reading in 2009, it was found that almost any song can become an earworm. A recent poll suggested over 90 per cent of the population experience them at least once a week with 15 per cent classifying their earworms as ‘disturbing’.",Reading scientists say chewing gum helps you forget a song .

"This is the chilling message a mother wrote on Facebook a day after allegedly abandoning her quadriplegic 21-year-old son in the Pennsylvania woods with just a blanket and a bible. 'I'm so happy,' Nyia Parler, 41, commented under a new picture of her cuddling her boyfriend on Tuesday. Just 24 hours earlier, police say she wheeled her care-dependent son into a park near their home in south west Philadelphia and left him there, before going to stay with her partner in Maryland. Relatives, who had been contacted by the boy's school when he didn't turn up to class on Tuesday, commented on Parler's picture, 'nyia call me asap,' and 'How the hell you happy?!? Call me!' On Sunday police said that Parler will be arrested as soon as she is released from hospital herself. Parler was admitted to a Maryland facility on Sunday for an 'undisclosed condition' and faces charges including aggravated assault, reckless endangering, neglect of a care-dependent person, kidnapping, unlawful restraint and false imprisonment, according to police in Pennsylvania. 'When her treatment is completed, we will take her to court and she can either waive or fight extradition,' Capt. Paul Starks of the Montgomery County, Maryland, police said in a statement. Chilling: This is the message Nyia Parler wrote on Facebook hours after she allegedly left her quadriplegic son alone in woodland with just a blanket and a bible. Relatives contacted by the boy's school frantically replied . Charged: Parler (right) was detained in Maryland on Saturday night, charged with assault and neglect. Police say she left her son on Monday to visit her boyfriend John Ferguson (left) in Montgomery County, Maryland . Horrific: The quadriplegic man was found here on the floor of a secluded woodland outside Philadelphia with this Bible and this blanket, 10 feet from his wheelchair. He'd allegedly been left there by his mother five days earlier . Parler left her son — who also has cerebral palsy — lying in leaves and covered with a blanket next to a wheelchair while she left town on a romantic getaway with her new boyfriend, John Ferguson, police said. He was found on Friday night near Cobbs Creek Park. Police believe he had been there for five days and the last time he and his mother were seen together was on Easter Sunday. She then boarded a bus to bisit Ferguson in Maryland, said Lt. John Walker of the Southwest Detectives Division. Walker said the victim was found around the corner from their home, and he described the scenario authorities believe to have taken place: 'She pushes him about 150 yards from the highway into the wooded area, takes him out of wheelchair, lays him on the ground, puts a blanket over him and leaves a Bible with him, and then just walks away.' During the period he was exposed to the elements, the young man was 'completely defenseless' in an area with wild animals, with no water and in cold, damp weather, Walker said. 'It's only by the grace of God that he survived this. Amazing,' he said. Reports claim relatives have been trying to obtain guardianship of the boy from Parler (pictured) for years . Contacted in Maryland after the young man's school became concerned about her absence, the victim's mother told relatives and authorities that he was with her, Walker said. 'Obviously her statements made during the week were not truthful,' he said. Her boyfriend, however, assumed other relatives were caring for the young man and 'was in shock when he learned what happened,' Walker said. A 16-year-old son also residing with the family is now in the care of other family relatives, Walker added. Walker said the son was hospitalized with dehydration, malnutrition, a deep cut on his back that caused concern about potential infection and possible eye injuries, but he appeared to be improving. 'He seemed to be a little happier yesterday,' Walker said. 'You could tell he knew his family was around and felt more comfortable. The 21-year-old, who is non-verbal and suffers from cerebral palsy, is now in Philadelphia Children's Hospital with his aunts, where he is being treated for dehydration and cuts to his back and eyes. Officials told NBC Philadelphia her son would have died if he hadn't been spotted by people walking along a nearby street. 'This kid is obviously a fighter. It's just unbelievable how we found him last night. It's just heartbreaking to see how another human, especially a mother, could treat him like that,' Lt. Walker of Philadelphia Police told ABC. Abandoned: A passerby noticed the 21-year-old here in a wooded Philadelphia park . The son was hospitalized with dehydration, malnutrition, a cut to his back and eye injuries. According to Philly.com two of his aunts, who are with him in hospital, have been trying to obtain guardianship for years. A neighbor, who declined to be identified, told DailyMail.com: 'She used to push him out to the school bus in his wheelchair, she seemed to care for him. Whenever I saw him, I saw her.' Another, who also wished to remain anonymous, said: 'I would see them outside together in the summer when he got home from school. Nothing looked wrong, I didn't suspect anything.' Walker said the son was exposed to the elements and other dangers. 'A lot of things could have happened out there,' he said. 'Obviously he's in the middle of a wooded area. You have wild animals there ... this kid could not defend himself. He does not function at all.' Walker added : 'What we've learned so far is that the 21-year-old child lives with his mother, completely dependent on mom as a result of his condition. 'She also has a 16-year-old son who is staying with other family members. 'We know she left for Maryland on Monday to go see her boyfriend on a bus.' The man had been reported missing from class at Philadelphia's School Of The Future on Monday. However, when a teacher called Parler she told them they were both in Maryland and he was well. Rescuers used flashlights to find the non-verbal in the East Lansdowne area of Philadelphia on Friday night . Investigation: Police arrested the man's 41-year-old mother, who left him alone in the park on Monday morning to visit her boyfriend in Maryland. Officers recovered the man's wheelchair (pictured) for evidence .","Nyia Parler, 41, allegedly left her 21-year-old son in woods on Monday and traveled to Maryland .

"(CNN)So now the real trial is underway: What does the surviving Boston Marathon bomber, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, deserve and why?  What's he likely to get and why? Let's start where the penalty phase starts, with the prosecution's case. Prosecutors have listed, as they must, the aggravating circumstances that make this horrific mass murderer deserve the harshest punishment. The killing was ""heinous, cruel and depraved.""   He placed a bomb in a crowd, set it to kill and maim children and adults indiscriminately -- if that's not heinous, cruel and depraved, what is? Cruelty classically consists of a desire to cause pain and suffering in innocent victims, or, at the opposite extreme, it reflects a cold, callous indifference. Tsarnaev displayed both. Cruelty really provides us a lens into the worst of the worst of the worst. The number of dead from the bombing (three) and injured (260), including dozens maimed, also elevate these murders.  The victims were vulnerable -- no one more so than 8-year-old Martin Richard.  For 2,500 years, we have proclaimed that all human beings are equally valuable, yet we identify certain victims as especially worthy, and those who prey on them as especially culpable. The prosecution's emphasis: The killings involved ""substantial planning and premeditation"" and a betrayal of the United States -- the very country that gave Tsarnaev shelter and citizenship. And then there's the selection of the site, the Boston Marathon, an ""iconic"" event. And then there's Tsarnaev's lack of remorse -- opening day, the prosecutor's final shot of Tsarnaev locked up, giving the security camera the finger.  From his blood-scrawled justification in the boat after the bombing to this day, the message has been: Screw you, society. Tsarnaev may take the stand to beg for mercy, but only if he now feels or at least can fake remorse. And don't confuse regret with remorse.  No doubt Tsarnaev regrets his present predicament, regrets the negative publicity he's brought his friends and family and most poignantly regrets running over and killing his older brother while trying to escape.  But that's a far cry from genuine remorse for the victims he's killed and maimed. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was the lesser of two evils, the defense will insist over and over. Tamerlan was the source of his younger brother's malicious intent.  As the prisoners inside Washington D.C.'s now defunct Lorton Central Prison once described the street code to me:  No snitching, but if someone dies, then ""the dead guy did everything."" So the defense will claim that Dzhokhar was not fully responsible because he could not be.  After all, he was only 19.  Biologists teach us our brains don't fully develop until we're 25.  Thus, their argument goes, a 19-year-old simply can't be the worst of the worst. In 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the death penalty for those younger than 18 when they killed, repeatedly quoting an article by psychologists Laurence Steinberg and Elizabeth Scott.  But in the same article, these leading developmental psychologists themselves characterized it as an ""open question whether under real-world conditions the decision making of mid-adolescents is truly comparable with that of adults."" And they were talking about 17-year-olds. To the best of my knowledge, science has not and cannot establish a definitive connection between organic brain development and moral responsibility. Think about it:  When a 19-year-old bravely dashes into a burning building, risking his life to save children inside, we celebrate this heroism. We do not, nor should we, dismiss this bravery as the product of an impulsive not-yet-fully-formed personality.  If we can fully celebrate good character and heroic acts of our best young adults, why can't we fully condemn the cowardly viciousness of our worst? What outcome would I predict in the Tsarnaev case? Confronted by surviving victims and images of their dead loved ones, hearing offsetting pleas to ""move on,"" balancing the real suffering in the courtroom against the  imagined punishment of life that awaits Tsarnaev, I expect the jury will vote 10-2 (or 9-3) for death. But they must be unanimous for death; a lopsided but divided jury would result in a life sentence. Worse, the historical record and headlines in the next day's anti-death penalty news organizations will probably proclaim:  ""Jury Chooses Life for the Marathon Bomber"" -- even if overwhelmingly the people's representatives were to vote for death as the more appropriate punishment. Requiring a unanimous verdict for death gives the defense an enormous advantage -- one of many.  Why? Because in the end, we would much prefer that 1 or 10 or 20 convicted murderers who deserve to die instead live out their lives in the relatively nonpunitive condition of prison than one person who deserves to live be wrongly killed at the hands of the people. And yet, if we really commit ourselves to having the punishment fit the crime, if we rightly reserve the death penalty for the most heinous crimes and criminals, surely the Boston Marathon bomber stands among the worst of the worst.","Robert Blecker: In sentencing phase, the prosecution lays out wealth of evidence that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev deserves penalty reserved for the worst of the worst . He predicts most of the jury will vote for a death sentence, but it must be unanimous; therefore, Tsarnaev will most likely get life in prison .",1b1b788f9a5f23b7a6d062863364035818accc4a

"All eyes were on John Terry this afternoon as he made the short trip across London to face QPR in the west London derby. Loftus Road was the place where the Chelsea skipper racially abused then QPR defender Anton Ferdinand in October 2011. Ferdinand's brother Rio was injured for Sunday's match. Terry, who has been a crucial part of Jose Mourinho's Premier League title bid this season, played the full 90 minutes however as Chelsea scraped a 1-0 win, but how did he get on... John Terry (centre) celebrates at the final whistle with Didier Drogba (left) and Branislav Ivanovic . Reception . There was a hostile introduction for Terry as the teams lined up, before a cacophony of boos rang out around the ground as he touched the ball in the opening minute. There was, however, no noticeable reaction from any of Chris Ramsey's players until Charlie Austin made himself known to the centre-back late in the first half with a robust challenge. Terry experienced a hostile atmosphere at Loftus Road, but put in a good display at the back for Chelsea . Temperament . It was a moment to cherish for the QPR fans as Austin responded to an arm across the chest by shoving Terry to the ground off the ball. The Chelsea skipper momentarily lost his cool and berated the assistant referee to the delight of the crowd. His battle with the striker continued into the second half, with the pair taken aside for a word after squaring up to each other but it was Terry who had the last laugh as Cesc Fabregas' late equaliser sealed three points. The Chelsea captain rises above Bobby Zamora to head the ball away as he dominated at the back . Performance . The former England captain was rarely troubled by Bobby Zamora and Charlie Austin. Although the pair were prominent throughout, a lack of pace meant Terry and partner Gary Cahill were able to deal with everything thrown at them even though they were bailed out by Thibaut Cortouis at times. There was a nervy moment in the first half when a long ball over the top caught out the 34-year-old, and he was lucky his misjudged touch didn't cost the side as Cahill covered, but it was a fairly comfortable day for the defender. The Chelsea captain was made to stretch occasionally, but he and Gary Cahil dealt with QPR's threat well . Conduct . Despite an obvious attempt from Austin to get under the skin of Terry, he largely ignored the attention surrounding him and focused solely on leading his side to an important win while handling the occasion with maturity. There were wild celebrations from Terry at the final whistle as he responded to the constant jeers. Terry's combative encounter with Charlie Austin attracted the attention of referee Andre Marriner .","John Terry racially abused Anton Ferdinand at the ground in October 2011 .

"In a retweet on Thursday, a staffer to real estate magnate Donald Trump managed to capture the coarsest background conversations Americans are having about former secretary of state Hillary Clinton's personal baggage. He may now be looking for a new job. 'If Hillary Clinton can't satisfy her husband,' a Texas-cowgirl college student tweeted, 'what makes her think she can satisfy America?' When someone retweeted the quip two hours later and included Trump's Twitter handle in the message, one of the billionaire's staffers retweeted it for him – to his audience of 2.8 million people. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . THE INTERNET IS FOREVER: A social media staffer to Donald Trump retweeted an off-color jab at Hillary Clinton on Thursday before the boss deleted it . Trump, a multibillionaire who's considering a presidential run, will be in New Hampshire on Saturday – where the episode will likely come up . SATISFIED? Bill Clinton (left) was a famous lothario during his presidency, even carrying on one affair with a White House intern . Time elapsed: Less than three hours. His office confirmed on Friday that it was a Trump employee, not a fat-fingered CEO, who was responsible. 'Mr. Trump was not responsible for this tweet,' a spokesperson told Daily Mail Online. 'It was retweeted by one of ten staff members that periodically help execute on Mr. Trump’s various social media platforms.' 'As soon as Mr. Trump saw the tweet he deleted it,' the spokesperson added. Hillary Clinton's once-strained relationship with her philandering husband isn't likely to be the stuff of TV ads in the 2016 presidential race, but the tweet suggests an undercurrent of crude jokes are being made at her expense. Sawyer Burmeister, a Texas equestrian champion, originated the line about Hillary Clinton's alleged inability to 'satisfy' her randy husband Bill . Bill Clinton, the 42nd U.S. president, had an affair with a White House intern named Monica Lewinsky. He also famously caroused with other women who were not his wife, going back to his days as the governor of Arkansas. A recent book about the staff who run the White House residence recounted a butler's story about hearing HIllary throw an object at him during the height of the Lewinsky saga. Taylor Burmeister, who wrote the tweet about Hillary failing to satisfy Bill, deleted it just before noon on Friday, along with a second message. 'Sry to those offended by me merely making a political joke,' she had tweeted in a follow-up. 'Get some rest, there are more important things in the world to be worried about.' She assured Daily Mail Online in an email that no one fro, the Trump camp had asked her to delete the tweets. 'I deleted them by choice because of the negative backlash I was receiving,' she said. 'I didn't even know Donald Trump had retweeted it until about an hour ago.' Burmeister confirmed to Daily Mail Online that she had deleted her tweets because of a nasty backlash . She originally offered an apology to people who were offended, but it apparently wasn't enough for some . Burmeister is no stranger to media attention. A world champion equestrian, she also had a bit part last year in an episode of the reboot of the 'Dallas' TV drama. And she's a pre-law student studying criminal justice at Tarleton State University in Texas, according to her social media profiles. Trump's retweet might have disappeared if a snarky Twitter user hadn't made a screen capture on his phone. 'Hey @RealDonaldTrump – In case you're looking for that tweet you deleted,' he wrote, 'I got it right here.' Hillary Clinton's campaign did not respond to requests for comment.","Sawyer Burmeister, a horse-riding champion and sometimes actress, tweeted the barb on Thursday evening .

"All well and good having Brazilians in your team but they have to be the right ones – Barcelona reached the Champions League semi-finals at the Nou Camp at Paris Saint Germain’s expense and Neymar tied David Luiz in knots in the process. There were no Luis Suarez nutmegs this time but the former Chelsea defender found himself backpedaling hopelessly on the quarter hour as Neymar scooted past him for Barcelona’s opener. Neymar (top) celebrates with Brazilian compatriot Dani Alves after scoring his and Barcelona's second goal of the night . Neymar accelerates past another Brazil teammate, David Luiz, before opening the scoring for Barcelona on Tuesday night . Barcelona: Ter Stegen 6.5; Dani Alves 7.5, Pique 5, Mascherano 6, Jordi Alba 6; Rakitic 7.5, Busquets 7 (Sergi Roberto 55, 6), Iniesta 9 (Xavi 45, 6.5); Messi 6.5, Suarez 6.5 (Pedro 75, 6), Neymar 9.

Subs not used: Douchez, Camara, Digne,  Bahebeck. Booked: Luiz. Referee: Svein Oddvar Moen (Norway) He was then a spectator on the half hour when his international team-mate got the second climbing unmarked to head Dani Alves’ cross past Salvatore Sirigu to make it 5-1 on aggregate. PSG’s soft centre cost them in the first leg and it was cruelly exposed again. Luiz was also booked inside the first five minutes for a foul on Andres Iniesta, who ran the first half. The man who won the World Cup for Spain but is these days criticised for neither scoring nor assisting went on a sublime run for the first goal, pulling away from Edinson Cavani and swerving past Marco Verratti before releasing Neymar. The French champions thought they were back in the game between the two Barcelona goals when on 17 minutes Zlatan Ibrahimovic had the ball in the net but he was a yard offside when Blaise Matuidi slipped him through and the flag was raised to rule out the goal. The Swede was jeered by Barcelona supporters in the early stages as was former Barcelona defender Maxwell but such was Barca’s dominance that home fans eased up on the light-hearted abuse. Suarez and Messi were also impressive in the first half and Alves looked like a man trying to impress a potential employer. PSG could still be a possible destination for him beyond the end of this season. He tested Sirigu from distance before his assist for Neymar’s second. With Suarez and Alves snapping into challenges and Iniesta and Neymar providing the finesse Barcelona were completely dominant – to the extent that for once Messi was not their most impressive performer. The home side eased up after the break and PSG breathed more easily without ever threatening to get back into the tie. Rakitic saw his shot saved and Messi went close with chip that Sirigu gathered.

Great Britain's tennis No 1 Andy Murray (left) was at the Nou Camp alongside his friend and former tennis player Ross Hutchins . PSG did force a save from Marc-Andre Ter Stegen 10 minutes into the second half when Ibrahimovic tried his luck from distance but the German keeper who has watched Claudio Bravo not put a foot wrong in the league all season gave another faultless display. Missing the domestic campaign has been tough but a final appearance in Berlin would be some consolation. Luis Enrique’s side were so comfortable at half-time Xavi replaced the impeccable Iniesta at the break. And it wasn’t long before Busquets and Suarez were also given early cuts. Barcelona still have a league to win and play the Catalan derby against Espanyol this weekend with sill just a narrow two point lead over Real Madrid. Iniesta had done enough in 45 minutes of football to not need to come out after half time. His performance and at times Barca’s was a throwback to some of their best football under Pep Guardiola when the won this completion in both 2009 and 2011. Iniesta was in sensational form for Barcelona before replaced at half time by veteran midfielder Xavi . Barcelona's captain had been criticised earlier this season for a lack of goals and assists but he looks to be back to his best . Guardiola was the name on most supporters lips at half time as news filtered through that Bayern were mauling Porto and were also heading for the semi-finals. The prospect of Barcelona and Bayern being drawn together on Thursday is mouth-watering. Although perhaps on current form, and in view of his side’s injuries, Guardiola might prefer to leave the reunions for Berlin on June 6.

"As America's elite crime investigators they are more used to tackling crime. But now FBI agents have been told they have to new enemy to battle -- calories. Expanding waistlines and lack of mobility for many agents has led to the introduction of a compulsory fitness tests. Those who fail will have the marks noted on their annual performance review and could lead to being moved from assignments that involve physical activity. Compulsory fitness tests have been introduced for all FBI agents following fears over expanding waistlines . FBI chief James Coney has introduced the tests amid fears his 135,000 agents are slipping behind when it comes to personal fitness. He said the force depends on its agents ability to 'run, fight and shoot'. Coney also said he wants the people to take one look at an agent think 'there goes a special agent of the FBI' rather than a derogatory remark about being overweight. Police in America are often parodied for their love of doughnuts and few forces have any weight restrictions. New recruits to the FBI have to take a physical test but for the last 16 years have not had to undergo any other fitness exam. As part of the annual test agents aged under 30 will have to run a mile in twelve and half minutes and sprint 300 metres in 59 seconds. They will also have to perform 24 push ups without stopping and 35 sit ups in a minute. Some agents have complained about the five minute break between the exercises as they struggle to catch their breath. FBI chief James Coney said the force depends on its agents' ability to 'run, fight and shoot' Older agents are given slightly longer times to perform the tests. A man in his 50s is allowed 15.14m for the mile run and 83 seconds for the sprint. The Federal Bureau of Investigation's 12,000 female agents must also take the test. According to the New York Times, who obtained an internal memo from Coney about the fitness tests, few agents have rushed to meet the October deadline to complete the physical. In the Washington DC office only 75 out of the 800 agents have taken the test. The introduction of the tests comes as America is grappling with an obesity problem with a third of adults deemed obese or overweight. Figures from the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention show that almost 80million adults are obese and the cause of death of more than 120,000 people a year. First Lady Michelle Obama has been at the forefront of tackling child obesity with a nationwide 'Let's Move' campaign urging children to get more exercise. The cost to the health care system treating people with illness caused by overeating such as strokes and heart attacks has been put at $98billion a year. The concern about the fitness of FBI agents began after the 9/11 terror attacks when the agency switched its main mission from catching criminals to fighting terrorism. Rather than taking part in arrests, often involving chasing criminals, they would spend hours sat behind a desk. Much of their work now involves cyber crime and intelligence gathering which mostly involves desk work and little exercise. 'You could see that health and fitness were not the priority it used to be,' said Zachary Lowe, the chief of physical instruction at the FBI HQ in Quantico, Virginia. Much of the FBI's work now involves cyber crime and intelligence gathering which mostly involves desk work and little exercise - hence the new drive to get fit . FBI chief Comey, who took over in 2013, discovered on touring field offices that morale was low. He also notes that many agents didn't look as if they would be able to pass the physical exam they had taken on joining the force. His new regime has led to many calling the agency the 'Fit Bureau of Investigation.' J Edgar Hoover, the famed first director of the FBI, had made fitness tests compulsory while he was in charge. Its current director said the lives of people they protect depend on agents fitness and health and they were symbols of what is 'right and good' about the US. He said: 'The lives of your colleagues and those you protect may well depend upon your ability to run, fight and shoot, no matter what job you hold. 'I want you to look like the squared away object of that reverence. I want the American people to be able to take one glance at you and think ""THERE is a special agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"".'","Compulsory fitness tests introduced thanks to expanding waistlines .

Manuel Pellegrini's side, meanwhile, strolled to victory against West Ham thanks to goals an own goal from James Collins and Sergio Aguero's 20th Premier League strike of the season. Sergio Aguero slotted City into a two goal lead after a flowing counter attack against West Ham . The Argentine striker sprints away in celebration having fired in his 20th league goal of the season . The victory meant City closed the gap on rivals United to just one point as the Etihad side look to remain in the top four after their aspirations of retaining the Premier League title slipped away. Defeats in six of the previous eight games had left the champions' title defence in tatters and even put their top-four place in jeopardy. Pellegrini, whose position is also under heavy scrutiny, said after the game: 'It was important to be a consistent team and we played - especially for the first 65 minutes until the injury of David that was a distraction - as a consistent team. 'In other games we have played some minutes but today I think we played the whole game.'",Angel di Maria and Marcos Rojo dine out together in Manchester .

"You won’t find it written down anywhere in black and white yet it remains one of the unseen by-laws of the game: until such time as an almighty mess is sitting squarely on FIFA’s front step, the governing body chooses to keep the door bolted firmly shut. Rows over goal-line technology were hardly something new when Frank Lampard’s infamous ‘ghost’ goal against Germany in the 2010 World Cup finally brought matters to a head. The 2000 Africa Cup of Nations Final between Nigeria and Cameroon had already been scarred by a similar howler while the world watched agog five years later as a Pedro Mendez effort which crossed the line at Old Trafford was incredibly missed by all the officials despite keeper Roy Carroll ending up tangled in the rigging. Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths has a goal-bound shot blocked by the outstretched arm of Josh Meekings . Such was the hullabaloo over the incident involving the Portuguese star that FIFA did, in fact, begrudgingly make some noises about trialling goal-line systems but it was no more than platitudes to appease the masses. It took Lampard’s ruled-out effort in Bloemfontein – with the ball being clearly a yard over Manuel Neuer’s line in the last-16 match – for the dam to finally burst. Despite initially shrugging off calls for the adoption of goal-line technology to be approved, FIFA relented two years later with the system fully operational last year in Brazil. The lesson for Scottish football fans still bemused by events at Hampden Park on Sunday when the officials failed to spot a potentially game-changing handball? Perhaps only when such an outrage occurs in the World Cup in Russia in three years’ time will common sense prevail. For those who believe the SFA are intransigent to football embracing the kind of video technology that would have seen Josh Meekings red carded and Celtic awarded a penalty in the Scottish Cup semi-final, here’s some news… . In February, the International Football Board – the SFA, FA, Irish FA, Welsh FA and FIFA – gathered in Belfast supposedly to discuss the possibility of approving trials. Before the meeting, FA representative David Gill made no bones about his association’s stance. Griffiths heads the ball, which is deflected clearly off the hand of Inverness' Josh Meekings (left) on Sunday . ‘We can’t live in the past,’ he stated. ‘Greg Dyke the (FA chairman) has come out and said he embraces it, and I think in certain circumstances I would look at it. We’ve got to move forward. The game is getting much quicker. ‘The TV coverage, you know, 28, 30 cameras a game. Everything is replayed, replayed. So how do we use that? My personal view is yes, sensibly, but it needs to be done in a manner that doesn’t detract from the fast-paced, quick action of football.’ Despite cases also being forwarded by the SFA and Irish FA to at least take the matter further, FIFA, aided by a sceptical Welsh representative, simply kicked the matter into the long grass. It won’t be discussed again for at least another year now with the inevitable injustices far enough off the radar in the interim. ‘It’s a question of making the biggest decision ever in the way football is played,’ said FIFA’s secretary general Jerome Valcke by way of an explanation for its rejection afterwards. While that may well be the case, procrastinating on the issue is hardly likely to resolve it. Injustices like those that almost certainly cost Celtic a place in the Scottish Cup Final on Sunday are hardly a rarity in the global game. Celtic captain Scott Brown (left) has words with referee Steven McLean during the Scottish Cup semi-final . Yet, until such time as one directly affects the outcome of a World Cup match involving one of the game’s heavyweights, they seem set to remain an ugly, unsatisfying feature of the landscape. To the great embarrassment of Michel Platini, the stationing of additional officials behind both goals has proved to be an extraordinary waste of time. Seemingly less reluctant to get involved than traditional linesman, ‘additional assistant referees’ - to give them their Sunday names - have seemed utterly superfluous since they were first trialled in the 2009-10 Europa League. On Sunday, Alan Muir, the official behind the goal, should have had a clear view of Meekings’ handball. But for reasons best known to himself, he failed to advise referee Steven McLean on what seemed an inevitable course of action. It took the high-profile blunder that denied Frank Lampard in 2010 to shift FIFA on goal-line tecnhology . ‘I knew it was a penalty,’ said Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths. ‘I think everyone in the ground knew it was a penalty. I asked the ref why he didn’t give the penalty and he said the assistant behind the goal said it hit him (Meekings) on the face.’ There is absolutely no excusing such crass incompetence. McLean and Muir should both have seen the handball with their own eyes and, even if one may have blinked at the wrong moment, assuredly one of them should have ensured the right call was made. That they didn’t is another blight on what’s been a desperate season for officiating in this country. Perhaps more than ever, the SFA now has good reason to press FIFA to at least road-test video technology. It’s hardly unchartered territory in sport. For those who prefer the oval ball game, a Television Match Official has been part of the fabric of rugby for 14 years now. No-one claims the system is perfect – decisions can often take longer to reach than they should - but few would dispute that it hasn’t enhanced the game because the right outcome is eventually arrived at. Lampard's disallowed goal forced FIFA to rethink, and Scottish fans must hope for a similar incident . Used only in first-class and international televised games, the TMO can only rule on exactly what the referee asks him. This usually involves, in try-scoring situations, whether a player’s foot has been in touch or to see if the ball has been properly grounded, but the TMO is also used to review if there has been dangerous or foul play. While the video review is normally conclusive, the snag – which is clearly a red flag for FIFA – is the time delay. At a recent Aviva Premiership match between Northampton Saints and Saracens, it took four minutes of review to award the winning try to the former while two other tries were disallowed. Edward Griffiths, the Saracens chief executive, later labelled the TMO process ‘a shambles’. ‘It’s almost make it up as you go along,’ Griffiths said. Indeed, rugby’s growing concern over the effect the TMO is having on the sport has led to Hawk-Eye, the ball-tracking technology company, to hold talks with the International Rugby Board about providing a replacement to the current system. Rugby's TMO may not be perfect, but it has shown that the game is better for use of technology . Hawk-Eye, which is already used in cricket, tennis and for goal-line decisions in football, says it can provide information for decisions within a few seconds by synchronising cameras from multiple angles. Paul Hawkins, the founder of Hawk-Eye, said: ‘Our system is a much cleverer way of looking at incidents. In Aussie Rules, we have halved the average time for decisions to be made.’ It can be assumed that, were FIFA to give tacit approval to video technology, Hawk-Eye would have just the programme to fit the bill. Using it sparingly would maintain the rhythm of football whilst ensuring that the 17 Laws of the Game are correctly applied. For football, the answers are already out there. If only someone would first ask the questions.",Celtic were denied place in Scottish Cup final by shocking decision . Leigh Griffiths' header was blocked by Josh Meekings' hand . None of the officials managed to spot the game-changing decision . Additional officials behind goals has proved an extraordinary waste of time . But FIFA will require a higher profile blunder to change their laws .,481852927eb65b181a74c14099b4b6b82e8b9128

"A transgender woman who had her face horribly damaged after it was injected with cement and tire sealant stepped out on Sunday showing off a new look. Rajee Narinesingh was one of the victims of 'toxic tush' doctor Oneal Ron Morris, who performed illegal plastic surgeries using substances such as Fix-a-Flat, Super Glue and mineral oil. Rajee had Morris inject her cheeks, lips and chin back in 2005, and ended up disfigured after she did not have the money to go to a proper cosmetic surgeon. Scroll down for videos . Rajee Narinesingh (above), one of the victims of 'toxic tush' doctor Oneal Ron Morris, stepped out showing her new face over the weekend . Rajee was recently treated by Dr Terry Dubrow and Dr Paul Nassif in a process that will be featured on the premiere episode of Botched . Left with a 'hard-as-rock' face, Rajee began seeing Dr John Martin of Coral Gables Cosmetic Reconstructive Surgery in 2012, who gave her softening injections and laser therapy to treat the botched surgery. In a 2014 interview she said that her new look was helping to boost her self-esteem, and that men were taking notice. 'Recently this guy said that being with me is like being with a sexy dragon,' she said at the time. 'I didn't know whether to slap him or kiss him.' Now, she has had her look improved once again by Dr Terry Dubrow and Dr Paul Nassif, a process that will be featured on the premiere episode of Botched. Rajee, who was born in New York but grew up in Philadelphia, explained when she realized she was a woman in that 2014 interview. She explained; 'Up until I was in my mid-twenties I just thought I was a feminine gay male. I thought about all the things I did when I was growing up - like taking the basketball my dad had bought me and instead of playing basketball with it I was simulating pregnancy and actually pretending to give birth and be a mommy. 'When I used to fantasize about being with guys I used to always picture myself with breasts and a vagina. I didn't realize I was doing it, it was just so natural for me. One day I just connected all the dots and thought ""you're not gay, you're transgender.""' Rajee lived in solitude and was afraid to go out after her face was left disfigured (above) That all changed in 2012 when she began receiving free treatments from Dr John Martin . Rajee, who had been too 'embarrassed and ashamed' to go to the authorities, claims she paid just $100 per session to Morris for the life-changing injections back in 2005. 'The last thing I wanted was to look like a man in a dress. I wanted to be a beautiful woman,' she said of her decision to get the injections. 'If you really want to live your authentic self as a woman you need to do some sort of face and body reconstruction. 'So I made the choice to get injections done. In our community it is called pumping.' And while she knew she was not seeing a licensed surgeon, she was still excited the day she went to see Morris. 'When it finally came to the day, I was more excited than nervous because I was finally going to be the woman I had always wanted to be,' she said. 'There was a room that she had set up where she did a lot of medical procedures.' The room looked sterile and clean she said, and sokn after she arrived they began the procedure. 'I got injections in my face and my hips and my buttocks and initially I was fine,' said Rajee. 'But then the nightmare started.' 'The last thing I wanted was to look like a man in a dress. I wanted to be a beautiful woman,' Rajee (above) said of her decision to get the injections. Oneal Ron Morris (above, file photo) is accused of leaving women ill and disfigured after injecting them with a mixture of toxic substances, including super glue and Fix-A-Flat . She was left with a large boil on her face that kept growing bigger and bigger, and then 'green pus exploded out of my face and onto the mirror. It was green and yellow and mixed with blood.' She ended up spending years in solitude as a result of these botched procedures, until Dr Martin agreed to help her for free. Because of him, she says she has gone from 'victim to victorious.' She is also ready to start dating again, saying; 'I definitely deserve more than just the 3 o'clock in the morning knock on the window.' As for Morris, she is now facing manslaughter charges after one of her patients died following a procedure.","Rajee Narinesingh, one of the victims of 'toxic tush doctor 'Oneal Ron Morris, stepped out showing her new face over the weekend .

"'Secret stuff': Ivana Chubbuck, 62, is a part therapist and part acting coach, known as the 'celebrity whisperer' She is known as the 'celebrity whisperer', a woman whose astonishing skill in honing Hollywood talent made an icon out of a man who used to stand on street corners dressed as a chicken. Today, Brad Pitt is known the world over. Ivana Chubbuck's client list includes Eva Mendes, Charlize Theron, Gerard Butler, Halle Berry, Sharon Stone and many others. So powerful are her methods, she reduced Beyoncé Knowles to tears within five minutes. And within months, the singer was topping the charts with Single Ladies. Part therapist, part acting coach, and very Hollywood, Chubbuck, 62, runs a hugely successful drama school in Los Angeles. She hosts workshops around the globe, as well as in the wood-panelled library of her £3 million home. Beyoncé went to Chubbuck when she was about to play legendary soul singer Etta James in the movie Cadillac Records and was looking to be taken seriously as an artist. Despite her professional success, Beyoncé was also at what she termed 'a pivotal point' in her life. 'I'm about empowering people,' Chubbuck told The Mail on Sunday in a rare interview – one which goes much further into her methods, and her clients' responses, than she usually allows. 'Beyoncé is a black girl from the South, that is her world. Like everyone else on the planet, she has issues. But once she faced those issues and realised she could use them in a positive way in her art, she flourished.' Apparently it's all about the 'secret stuff' that Chubbuck's clients tell her. Certainly it is well known that Beyoncé's relationship with her domineering father has been fractured for years. 'I told her to open up, to really get in touch with her feelings and what was going on inside her,' Chubbuck said. 'She started to feel her secret stuff and we start having a dialogue about it and she became emotional. We were crying together. She tapped into that well of pain inside her. 'She rang me up after we'd worked together on the movie and said, 'Listen to my new record – it's all the stuff you taught me.' And that's when she came out with Single Ladies and all the great female empowerment songs. The little pop star turned into a global icon.' When we meet at Chubbuck's home, model and actress Eva Mendes is just leaving after a three-hour 'intensive session' for her new movie with Ricky Gervais called Special Correspondents. Clients: Chubbuck works with some of the biggest names in show business including Beyonce (left) and Eva Mendes (right) Eva's Prada dress in pale orange . Shop the designer at Saks Fifth Avenue! Visit site . Esmeralda! We LOVE it. And we've a feeling little Esmeralda might be a little style icon in the making, just like her mum. So what that in mind, it's time to revisit one of our favourite Eva Mendes looks. This woman can wear what she likes. Even in bold shades of orange she still manages to look flawless, which is why we've decided to take some autumnal inspiration from this premiere perfect look. She wore this orange Prada dress back in March of 2013, but we still can't quite get over it. It's floaty, feminine and gorgeous. Eva teamed this orange number with a lighter hue satin shoe, which added another texture and dimension to the look. We would definitely suggest a strappy, metallic heel with this. So, if you're keen to update her look for the new season, check out our pick of the best colour-popping dresses (below). We'll be donning Mango's layered mini dress with a leather biker jacket to see out the summer in style. Mango Chiffon Ruffle Dress . Visit site . Boohoo Laura Curve Column Dress . Visit site . Bec & Bridge Isis Angle Dress (now on sale for $178!) at Revolve . Visit site . Carven Crêpe de Chine Dress at Barneys . Visit site . So what did that amount to? Mendes said: 'Ivana's technique could be boiled down to: take the pain in your life and find the most effective way to accomplish a goal with it.' In other words, your guess is as good as mine. Mendes continues: 'It helps you understand humanity – what drives someone to do what they do, good or bad. It's not painful… it's cathartic.' Chubbuck first met Brad Pitt when he was working as a promoter for a fast-food restaurant dressed in a chicken suit, and tells a story of a young man so driven by a desire to succeed that he had no life aside from acting. Today, he is still a client and Chubbuck worked on his most recent movie, Fury. She made an icon out of Brad Pitt, who when she met him was working as a promoter at a fast-food restaurant dressed in a chicken suit . 'Brad always had a work ethic that put others to shame,' Chubbuck said. 'He studied and worked. I would pair him up with a partner and many of those partners would ask to be changed because Brad wanted to rehearse a scene three, four, five hours a day. He was dedicated to his craft. He had no social life. He had his stupid job and the rest of the time he was studying with me. 'For the major talents, fame is never the driving force. Brad worked his butt off, he's taken risks over the years and when he fails he gets back up and works harder. He makes bold choices and isn't afraid to fail.' So what is the secret? Chubbuck says her technique is based on delving into your 'deepest, darkest past' and then using those negative feelings to positively portray a character on screen. Some of this is outlined in a best-selling book The Power Of The Actor (Gotham Books) which has been translated into 18 languages. Stars such as Kate Bosworth, Camilla Belle, Elisabeth Shue and Mendes have given the tome glowing reviews. Mendes said: 'It is my bible – I don't leave home without it.' Chubbuck recently returned from a working trip to London and says the phenomenon of British actors dominating Hollywood (Eddie Redmayne, Benedict Cumberbatch, Daniel Craig) is 'because Brits have a great work ethic and are not afraid to take risks or make fun of themselves'. Do her celebrity friends such as Matthew Perry, James Franco and Jake Gyllenhaal ever expect star treatment? 'Bottom line is they are with me to work,' Chubbuck says. 'Celebrity goes out the window. I'm about stripping them bare. The one thing I have learned over the years is that all of us have the same needs and wants as human beings. 'It doesn't matter if you are in London or the Philippines. There's a shared human story – we all want love, we all have issues with our spouses or partners, with our parents. The key thing is taking the bad stuff and not being a victim. 'You have to use that stuff to empower yourself.'","Ivana Chubbuck, 62, is known as the 'celebrity whisperer' and hones talent . She's a therapist and acting coach and runs a drama school in Los Angeles . Chubbuck counts Beyoncé, Eva Mendes and Brad Pitt among her clients .",d3076ec90c3dcf0553ed28ed2809f64dc6969750
"Not a single Labour candidate questioned by a major polling company mentioned the deficit as being one of the biggest issues facing Britain. Ipsos Mori interviewed almost 100 candidates from the major parties, asking them what they thought the most important issues facing the country were. Not one Labour candidate listed the government spending or the deficit; compared to 35 per cent of Tory candidates. In an IpsosMori survey of people standing for election, not one of Ed Miliband's Labour candidates named the deficit as an important issue facing the country . 35 per cent of Tories mentioned the deficit, 5% of Lib Dems and 9 per cent of those surveyed standing for the Scottish National Party . Among the Liberal Democrats, 5 per cent mentioned the deficit as an issue; and even among the left-wing SNP, it was brought up by 9 per cent of candidates. The omission recalls Ed Miliband’s embarrassing gaffe in which he completely forgot an entire passage about the deficit from his conference speech last year. The issue of Britain’s relationship with the EU was also not mentioned by a single Labour candidate. Unlike David Cameron, Mr Miliband is not pledging any renegotiation of powers or a referendum on EU membership. Pollsters from Ipsos Mori asked 98 candidates to list what they thought were the biggest issues. They could mention anything they liked – there were no promptings. The top issue for all parties was the economy, mentioned by 85 per cent of Conservative and Lib Dem candidates but only 62 per cent of Labour ones. For Labour, the economy tied with health and the NHS as the main issue. It was mentioned by 62 per cent of candidates, compared with 65 per cent for the Lib Dems and 54 per cent of Tories. The next most important issues for Labour were ‘inequality’ (mentioned by 24 per cent of candidates), housing (21 per cent), and then jobs, immigration and education (all tied on 14 per cent). For Tory candidates, the third most important issue was spending and the deficit (35 per cent), jobs (31 per cent), education (27 per cent) and the relationship with the EU (19 per cent). No Conservative candidates mentioned inequality, housing or the impact of austerity. The economy and the NHS were the most frequently mentioned issues among the three main parties . Immigration, housing and international ties were the least likely to be mentioned by candidates . Austerity was the most important issue for the SNP (64 per cent), while surprisingly only 3 per cent of Labour candidates mentioned it. The survey, unveiled at a briefing by Ipsos Mori, was based on interviews with 98 candidates, including 26 Tories, 29 Labour and 20 Lib Dems. The briefing pointed out that the last time an opposition party was elected with an overall majority after just a single parliament out of office – the goal of Labour – was in 1931. It said that a leader had never been elected prime minister with such low ratings as Mr Miliband. But it also pointed out that the last time a governing party increased its votes hare after more than two years in office – the goal of Mr Cameron if the Tories are to govern alone – was 1955. Meanwhile Harriet Harman has admitted that drivers could be hit with a hike in fuel duty if Labour gets into power. The deputy Labour leader refused to rule out above inflation increases in taxes on fuel, alcohol, tobacco or air fares. Asked if the party would raise the levy on petrol, she told LBC: ‘We rule out increasing VAT, the basic or the higher rate of tax, we will put up the top rate of tax, we will not put up the national insurance rates. ‘For all the other taxes that there are – you know, airport taxes, I can’t remember what they are called, airport passenger duties, or alcohol duties or tobacco or petrol – we will lay that out in the Budget.’ It emerged that Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, had called for the scrapping of the Trident nuclear deterrent. The potential leadership contender suggested that Trident should be ‘the first to go in the round of public spending cuts to come after the general election’, according to a 2010 interview with Brixton Blog.",Poll of candidates asked them what were country's biggest challenges .

"A woman who is five months pregnant and was fired from her job at Popeyes after an armed robber made off with $400 on her shift says she has been offered her job. Only Marissa Holcomb isn't so sure she wants to go back to the fried chicken chain in Channelview, Texas. The mother-of-three was held at gunpoint on March 31, however she was fired when she refused to pay back the money that was stolen, with the store saying she should not have allowed so much cash to be in the till at one time. Now Popeyes have offered to take Holcomb back and have offered her $2,000 in backpay, since she has been out of work for almost one month. 'I do need a way to support my kids,' she told KHOU. '(But) I don't want to go back to a business where I'm treated the same and I just get pushed back out if something else happened.' Scroll down for video . Welcome back: Marissa Holcomb - who is five months pregnant with her fourth child - was fired from Popeyes after $400 was robbed from her till and she refused to pay it back. She has now been offered her job back, but is unsure whether to take it . Robbery: A man armed with a handgun and his concealed with a red beanie held up the Popeyes in Channelview, Texas, on March 31. Less than two days later Marissa Holcomb was fired . Hold up: The robber managed to get $400 cash from the till, which Popeyes said is too much money to have kept in the register. They said it is not the first time Holcomb had got in trouble for not clearing the till . Holcomb was left shaken by the incident, in which a man armed with a handgun and his face concealed with a red beanie jumped the counter and held the gun to her head, demanding money. Holcomb wasn't able to access the safes, so the robber made with the cash in the till - totaling $400. Her bosses said it was against there policy to have such an amount in the register and gave Holcomb an ultimatum - pay it back or lose her job. 'I just had a gun to me. I'm not paying the money,' Holcomb told KHOU earlier in the week. 'I don't think it's right because now I'm struggling for my family because what I had to do to keep my life. 'I mean who's gonna call me? I'm five months pregnant. 'The fact that I got robbed at gunpoint and it's like nobody cares.' Holcomb said she was fired less than two days after the incident. A Popeyes spokesman said it wasn't the first time Holcomb hadn't cleared the till. Marissa Holcomb, who is five months pregnant with her fourth child, was held at up at the fried chicken chain store in Channelview on March 31 and then fired because of it . The spokesman said that if Holcomb was given the opportunity to pay the money back they were not aware of such a situation. CEO Cheryl Bachelder then released a statement Wednesday evening, saying head office had 'reached out' to the owner of the Channelview store and asked him to 'apologize and rectify' the situation. Holcomb claimed she had done her job properly and that it was an extremely busy night. The chain were offering a popular two piece chicken special for $1.19 on the night of the robbery. 'They got what they got because that's what we made within one hour,' she said.

"For more than 2,000 years, invaders have been fighting over glorious Kefalonia. Romans, the Kingdom of Naples, the Venetian Republic, the Ottoman Empire, the French, British and, during the Second World War, the Italians and Germans have all left their mark. Fortunately, the present settlers - the Greeks themselves and the odd expat - have stoutly resisted the encroachment of mass tourism. So instead of fast-food restaurants you will find charming family-run tavernas that make this island a foodie heaven. Great forests of pines, cypress and cedars still sweep down the steep hillsides, often ending in cliffs of chalk as white as those at Dover, or in fine shingle and sand beaches, fringing a sea whose warm, sun-reflecting waters are of startling clarity. The famous curve of Myrtos beach, as well as many little inland villages, are seen on the road to Fiscardo . Inland, the roads, winding around mountains whose accessible slopes are swathed in olive groves and vineyards are blessedly free of excessive traffic. We landed at the island's only airport near the capital town of Argostoli, took a five-minute walk to the car-rental office and were quickly on our way to the village of Spartia on the southern coast - our first base of a two-centre holiday. Richard Johnson rejoices in unspoiled Kefalonia . We were staying first at the superb Villa Hephaestus. The view from our shady veranda was wonderful - indeed, my American wife called it 'awesome'. The sweep of Lourdas Bay, with its long sandy beaches, was spread out below us, while the neighbouring island of Zakynthos could be seen in the misty distance. Hephaestus is a modern villa with a well-equipped kitchen, and we love to cook. However, after a long day travelling, we decided we needed restorative cocktails, a carafe of white wine and a good fish dinner. Not fancying driving along twisting lanes, we called a taxi to take us to the beautifully situated and highly regarded Water Way restaurant at Spartia beach. The proprietor is a local fisherman, so the best of his catch goes to the kitchen, which is presided over by his wife, while his charming daughter Tepsi is in charge of front of house. From Lourdas Bay you can see Zakynthos Island, where the beautiful Shipwreck Beach (pictured) is found . A sweeping view across the turquoise waters of Lourdata Bay and the white stands of Lourdas Beach . The island is replete with diverse things to see on day trips but the nightlife is virtually non-existent, so we decided to stay home in the evenings and explore during the day. We checked out the string of beaches around Lourdas Bay and found plenty of good restaurants. At the top of a flight of easy steps from Lourdas beach, we found Lorraine's Magic Hill restaurant, with superb food lovingly prepared by the eponymous owner with ingredients from her husband's organic farm. The portions are generous and there's a great view across the bay to fellow Ionian isle Zakynthos. The popular Skala beach is just at the end of the bay. The Metaxa Beach Bar is a good place for coffee and the area is lined with tavernas. We shopped for supplies for our evening meals at Argostoli's port. One can buy catch-of-the-night fish straight from the boats that line the quay (park where you like, for free). The popular golden Skala beach is just at the end of the bay with the nearby Metaxa Beach Bar good for coffee . The town of Argostoli's port is ideal for picking up supplies, including catch-of-the-night fish  from the boats . Enjoyable excursions to the countryside took us to the ruined hilltop castle of St George, near Peratata, and the monastery of St Ayos. At both places entrance is free, and don't miss the Castle cafe just outside the gates. Its enthusiastic proprietors are Greek/English and serve superior food in a shady garden. The Monastery of Saint Geronimo is situated in a vine-clad valley north-east of the castle. It was rebuilt in Byzantine-style in the 1960s, the original having been destroyed during a 1953 earthquake. The walls of the interior are decorated in exuberant style with biblical scenes, and a huge candelabra hangs from the ceiling. We loved our stay in the south, but for the second week of our stay it was time to take the 35-mile drive to Fiscardo, on the island's north cape. The trip afforded superb views of the coast - including the famous curve of Myrtos beach - as well as many little inland villages. Fiscardo, once a remote fishing port, has been transformed into a world-class yachting centre, with smart restaurants and boutiques jostling for every inch of the quayside. The second week of our stay was a 35-mile drive away in the fishing village of Fiscardo , in the island's north . 'It's like St Tropez in the old days,' I mused. Our villa, Island View, is set on the hillside overlooking the port. From its verandas and infinity pool the neighbouring islands of Ithaca - mythical home of Odysseus - and Lefkas could be seen through the shimmering sea mist. We found some attractive beaches a few minutes' drive from Fiscardo. Our two favourites were Agia Jerusalem and Alaties, both reached by turning right out of the village of Maganos and following the signs. Agia Jerusalem is considered a 'secret' place, peaceful even in August. When we visited (in September), fewer than a dozen people were enjoying the sunbeds provided. Agia Jerusalem Beach is considered a 'secret' place, peaceful even in August, and a favourite of the writer . There's an excellent taverna, with fresh fish and dishes from a menu that changes daily. Alaties, on the other hand, is a tiny cove with a miniature beach. It's lovely to swim there. Among the fir trees above the beach is a modern restaurant where fresh prawns can be had. Apart from one afternoon of rain (we were on a boat trip to Lefkas but 30 minutes out of Fiscardo, an unexpected squall hit us and it rained for the remainder of the trip), the weather was perfect. We had a wonderful time with beautiful scenery, great food and fun when we wanted it. I can see why so many people have wanted to invade Kefalonia!","Visited Spartia in the south of Kefalonia and then Fiscardo, in the north . First, from Villa Hephaestus, could see Lourdas Bay and  Zakynthos island . Charming local, family-run eateries were found throughout the island . Nightlife is virtually non-existent, so spent energy exploring during the day . Fiscardo, once a remote fishing port, is now a world-class yachting centre .",be37f96dc278debb9a5b7b422362c6907dfa53de
